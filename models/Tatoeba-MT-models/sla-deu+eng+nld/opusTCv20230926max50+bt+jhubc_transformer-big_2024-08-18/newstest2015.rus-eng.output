India also reportedly hoped for an agreement on defence cooperation between the two States.
FANO of Russia will hold the final expert session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release sent to the editors of Lenta.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for evaluating the work of scientific groups and the criteria for conducting assessments.
The third expert session will be the final event in the series of events on the formation of a common approach for all three academies to the methodology for assessing the effectiveness of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in this, and the final version of the normative documents is in agreement.
According to the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of scientometric and expert analysis processes, agree on the stages and timing of the assessment," said Elena Aksenova, Head of the Expert and Analytical Department of the FANO of Russia.
Representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutes of Russia will take part in the event.
As a result, a resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow city, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to find related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California at Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical uniformities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to look among the stars related, that is, arose from one cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and briefly they can be found on the website of the university.
The reason for the same chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas, which precedes the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the stellar cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the stars-relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, scientists using a supercomputer simulated two streams of interstellar gas that together formed a cloud.
This object, within a few million years under the influence of its own gravity, is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added label paints to the original gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieved a high degree of chemical uniformity.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to look for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as to determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata Police Arrest 20-Year-Old After Chasing Motorcycle At High Speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after it was driven at a speed of 125 km/h in the zone with a speed limit of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape from the police in Pilbara.
A transport police patrol in Carrat attempted to stop a blue motorcycle this morning, finding that its speed reached 125 km/h as it drove off from a service station on Batgate Road.
Police say the motorcyclist did not stop and continued on Burgess Road, then rolled into the bushland, causing the police to lose sight of him.
The motorcycle and the man corresponding to the driver’s description were spotted near the house on Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police have charged a 20-year-old man with refusing to stop and dangerous driving.
He is due to appear before the Karratha court on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated and detained for three months.

Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not “knock the door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock the door” in connection with new sanctions.
This was stated today by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
Regarding our response to a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even speculate, fantasize, because everything has to be calculated specifically, he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will be worthy of this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be due to a knock on the door, some insults, misunderstood, - the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, base on our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners in terms of their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are being taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are trying to achieve, the Russian Foreign Minister continued.
If they say in a loud voice that “these sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do it to punish Russia,” this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, it is not.
On the contrary, we want to more actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory policy towards anti-dumping procedures.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and, at the same time, anti-dumping measures are being applied against sectors of the Russian economy.
"We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the norms of the third energy package of the EU retrospectively," Lavrov said.
How to properly use a lilac in the design of the garden?
Irina Okuneva answers the questions:
Since the lilac after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other bushes.
It blends well with many cultures.
And next to the mermaid, you can and should plant both plants, decorative in other times, and blooming at the same time with it.
Another plus of the siren is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a resemblance to a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best fits the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of fake money convicted a resident of the Leningrad region
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in Olonetsky and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to end the investigation into the crimes committed in our republic, he was staged in Segezh.
The investigation proved the guilt of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money, dating back to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court ruled to replace the term of imprisonment for four years with serving in the colony of the general regime.
The sentence did not come into legal force.
We will remind, last week convicted two more sellers of fake money, which they paid in the stores of Petrozavodsk.
Citizens of Azerbaijan also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One is sentenced to five years in prison, the other to four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has also not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish delivered military aid from the United States and the United Kingdom to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the pledge stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the embankment named after Sedov in Solombal.
Representatives of veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class gathered for the event.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Sea Shipping Company.
Then the city brass band performed at the event, and the pupils of the cadet classes presented the veterans with flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the banner of Victory.
The rally ended with the laying of flowers to the pledge stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of moulded boots, tin, wool, and a host of other equipment and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were also military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep-sea bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen fighters "Harrikane", in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy was 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached its destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a bill that would protect trade unions as a civil right.
“Where unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who co-chairs the Progressive faction Congress.
That’s why I’m proud to present the Workers’ Empowerment Act along with the Civil Rights Movement symbol, John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give workers the same legal opportunities to discriminate against trade union organisations as other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions.
Amending the Labour Regulations Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participating in trade union organizations to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive damages and penalties - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill offer is to remember a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions played a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to organize, to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that ensured that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and to every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal effect; measures aimed at these purposes will be considered unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the World Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948 would be adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions to defend their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted as a proper basic provision that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and to have that union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised an entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers us as well.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against trade union organisations – are long overdue.
Keith Allison and John Lewis revive the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
The judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the enactment of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under the measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadl in June and was due to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to receive patients in hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can now continue to perform legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing their powers of attorney,” Judge John deGravells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within a month, during which the judge will render a more permanent decision on this law.
Advocates of the right to abortion welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a treacherous law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to suspend the law on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applied to the doctors from the two clinics who had not acted as plaintiffs in the case and had also applied for admissions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts have recently ruled such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admission authority, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing the procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admission authority await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of trade networks should be Russian-made, according to the Deputy of the State Duma from the faction "Fair Russia" Oleg Nilov.
The parliamentarian prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> For the rest of the groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers,” Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, which establish a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is included in the package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company “Nalogovik”, a member of the independent expert center “Public Duma” Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will start to expand, some will learn faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, however, not immediately," the expert said.
Previously, Russian enterprises were often unable to break into the shelves of local stores due to the high competition from foreign analogues.
Now, after the embargo, this niche has been released and you can breathe a sigh of relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will arrive on the Russian market.
In other words, now there is a "moment of calm", when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," said the first Vice-President of the All-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", Ph.D. Tamara Kasyanova.
Definitely, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will secure the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, rather than with goods that, at the expense of subsidies from another state, are cheaper.
In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under the uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanov notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all the articles.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to “reach” the share of Russian goods to half of the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that the shelves will receive low-quality goods.
Perhaps under the guise of being produced in Russia, foreign products with broken labels will be supplied,” the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that in such a scenario, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas for domestic goods can affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was again talked about by economists in February this year due to the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of abandoning imported products is becoming even more urgent.
The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of orders to suppliers to consider domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," said Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be particularly effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, meat production can get a powerful boost.
As you know, the largest share of imports is preserved on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% is still accounted for by Russian products," Kasyanov said.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products will contribute to import substitution and may accelerate this process.
However, this initiative will not lead to import substitution in itself, since it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is sure.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that full import substitution will not take place, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to fulfill these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide", - the expert states.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
The researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research reported that those living in regions and remote areas of the state were 20 percent more likely to die during the study than those living in urban areas.
LARGE RESEARCH: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that an untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that an increase in the number of on-the-go services that would allow professionals to treat women closer to home and support programs for people undergoing treatment away from home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elisha Neve, was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September in the Kuzhenersky district will open the doors of the new FAP
The construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaybelyak was started in April this year and was carried out according to a model project.
The cost of work amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built therapeutic and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybelyak and the villages of Dementyevo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraybelyak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new paramedical and obstetric center will replace the existing FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resource, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
Killer of four-month-old son intoxicated new boxer will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of her own child.
In Cheboksary completed the investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksary, accused of causing death by negligence.
The investigation established that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of the child of her godfather in Cheboksary.
After a long feast, the new boxer decided to stay home and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunken woman put him next to her on the bed to feed her breasts, but soon fell asleep.
During sleep, a woman attacked her son, resulting in his death from suffocation.
A criminal case, the press service of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation on Chuvashia, was sent to the court.
Inflation is out of vacation.
Will the Russians feel a sharp increase in prices?
As a result of cross-sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not meet the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the delayed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and even less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the mayor should make “small, but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth of incomes of the population.
In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," the newspaper's source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the financial and economic bloc of the government regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation of sales tax (SST) in 2015, experts believe.
The inflation peak of 9% will be in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation imposed "clean sanctions".
AiF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, Head of the Analytical Department of FC AForex:
Prices are already rising in the main product segments.
Moreover, when socially important products began to be valued, the government was forced to launch measures to systematically monitor price stability in order to prevent the risks of unwarranted price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting to regulators on a daily basis so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal pace of capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the cost of a basket of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in just a quarter.
The ban on the import of food products caused a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of growth of the inflation component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the worsening prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvaev, Director of the Analytical Department of Alpari
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, in zero it was also above the current level, another thing that was then compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think that at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, asset manager of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still being successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in purchases of cash currency in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer calm and, perhaps, this autumn will become more tangible.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, as Russia has more financial savings.
Gardening centers are sad about the decrease in the number of homeowners
This drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead horticultural centers to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “basic age of horticulture,” according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that owners of their own homes spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of pavementing yards in front of the house for parking, and a reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated to be <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners fell from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest spending rate on gardener goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and lack of space for the garden does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor at RHS, said: “Growing plants in containers, for example, is particularly popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "Golden Age" of retail trade in gardening goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleaning in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria reported only the removal of the Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper "Trud".
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because by law we are not members of the management, but I was later informed that I had been released.
I can’t say why my dismissal isn’t reported on the foundation’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to know more on Monday,” Angelova told the newspaper.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of the Investment Lending in the Central Fund in Agriculture in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolay Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for the fields paid to the EU.
Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the Agricultural Fund in Veliko Tarnovo until January 2014, will be appointed in his place.
Only the deputy head of the Atidzhe Aliyeva-Veli Foundation kept his post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has summoned the country’s top U.S. diplomat for clarification in connection with a report of U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. attorney and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former NSA analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence facility for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the message, saying all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reports that Germany’s main intelligence agency has also made Ankara an intelligence target have sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
China's largest companies join forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messenger, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the wonder of the Chinese Internet, which has left even its American rivals – eBay and Amazon.com – behind, will not be easy.
The Union of Largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will be owned by Wanda and 15% - each of the Internet companies, Wanda Group said in a statement.
It is planned to register the company in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (the largest social network in China, with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the shores of the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest cinema operator in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the newly created competitor Alibaba.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, according to Dong Tse.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupon sales services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the largest cake in online commerce,” Wanda Wang Jianlin, the CEO, told Bloomberg.
“There is no real O2O site in China right now, and in this situation everyone has roughly equal chances,” he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the world’s largest, and McKinsey & Co. estimates its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011 to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has risen to 632 million, according to official statistics by Bloomberg, which is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015, this number can grow to 850 million people.
The Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was the richest man in China until recently, however, according to the Bloomberg Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already overtaken him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Li is now the third richest person in China, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is the fourth.
“It’s very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer,” said Bloomberg, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Cao Lei.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to compete seriously with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "Rome can not be built in one day."
The fact that with Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only with new companies, but also well-deserved leaders of the world Internet trade, evidenced published on the eve of the report on the financial performance of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company earned more than both of its U.S. competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit over the period is almost twice that of its competitors – it has almost tripled year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has a huge potential for generating money, thanks in large part to its mobile apps,” said a report by analyst Arete Research Service in Hong Kong.
According to the updated Alibaba prospectus on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July amounted to 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions over the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba has to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The road-show of the company, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s exit to the IPO is expected to be a record in NYSE’s history and will allow the company to raise about $20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on U.S. exchanges belonged to the payment system Visa, which in 2008 held the initial placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trade networks should be of Russian production, according to the deputies of the State Duma.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law "On the bases of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" and the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
Important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of domestic products in stores should be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in winter, so a "discount" will be made for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper Izvestia.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Reserve "On Retail Markets" was submitted to the lower house of parliament, which proposes to revive in Russia farmers' markets, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the state prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Calvia’s police chief on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous center of unbridled drunkenness Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was detained on corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street that houses most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the daily online publication Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the anti-corruption prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Guardia Nacional de Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say protectionism by the authorities is seriously affecting the state of their business.
“It’s no longer about making money, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
We cannot jeopardize our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines in the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British holidaymaker making a blowjob to 24 men during a bar race.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to stop drunken hooliganism among Magaluf vacationers, minimizing the number of infamous alcohol races in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the blowjob incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the race in the bars Carnage together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous alcohol-intoxicated accidents associated with insane fun known as "balconying" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
SPRING has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening by 9 pm, following the 6.6 mm that fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a pair of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave an early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a high of just 15.8C in the city.
The rough conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay in the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule right after 7:30 p.m., but fell into a wind shift zone – a sudden change in speed or wind direction over a short distance – and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused subsequent delays on several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday, with the probability of one or two showers.
Calculation of estimates of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will occur in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks, the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
Under the FAS, an expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector was established.
At his meeting, the head of the Department of control of housing, construction and natural resources of the FAS Vadim Solovyov said that "today's calculation of the estimates of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible."
The normative base makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, according to the FAS.
And they propose the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations used today.
These proposals are included in the “road map” and are now under consideration in the Ministry of Construction.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” Vadim Solovyov explained.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
The Ministry of Finance agrees with the FAS.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of cost on constructive elements already exist: methods for calculating prices for constructive solutions, drawing up estimates on these indicators have been developed," said Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The field of road construction was chosen as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told RGB, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but no other mechanism has yet been proposed to the business.
"As for the proposed calculations for structural elements, in practice it is difficult to implement, because in the construction of buildings often use completely different technologies," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely due to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of NP "Expert community of professionals of state order" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, Deputy Director of Engineering of Rosatom’s industrial capital construction center, drew attention to the fact that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is maximally protected from someone’s managerial influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state procurement in such a way that the same executor is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As Elena Zhukova explained, in this case it will be necessary to assign the customer the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the regular number of the customer and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the specialists of the customer will have to have knowledge that allows to assess the quality of the work performed by the contractor organizations, as well as their safety.
Often, with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach may lead to the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to the lack of interest in obtaining a state order for incomplete work and a small contract amount.
Oleksandr Evstashenkov, Deputy Head of the Expert Advisory Center of the Procurement Institute, believes that now the state procurement procedure has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And gave an example: "the participant when filling out the application must specify "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "similar type", "not lower", "below", "above", "may", "may have", "may not", "before".
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of an application submitted by contractors.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work through the "paper" offer of the participant at the stage of application.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of work, which has not even begun to perform, - the expert believes.
The quality of work can be assessed only when it is accepted.
At the expert council, it was also proposed to move the marginal income from the upper to the lower echelon so that intermediate contractors would disappear.
Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, Deputy Head of the FAS Andrey Tsarikovskiy believes that this should not be done, since the general contractor should be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will turn out, as in the famous rerun of Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "To the buttons there is a claim?".
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mines rained on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as the territory recovered from fighting.
The start of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of hostilities remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed the traces of fragments from the walls and children's slides before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to the future,” said Ronit Barth, a resident of Kibutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Barth, said it was “a bit strange” to start school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before a cease-fire deal halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go outside or left their homes, leaving for safer areas farther from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that has become heavily damaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce on Tuesday.
The cease-fire immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand for the lifting of the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and the opening of airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its arms and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel contests these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; despite this, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools, which have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, officials in charge of education postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, real estate prices showed the highest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a cumulative increase of 4.2 per cent in June, July and August, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12-month growth as of August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices in Sydney rose 16.1 percent over the past year, while in Melbourne they rose 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five percent to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which was followed by government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent per year.
Mr Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties put up for sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales, and the current low-interest conditions, it is likely that the cost of housing will rise further over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold-industrialists and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century since the time of construction has hardly changed, except for the old age.
Foreigners come here as a tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is not nearly 300 years old.
The old courtyard, always an open door, a creaking staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls cracked, and in the lumens of the peeled plaster in places the street is visible.
I think it's all about honesty.
And the locals say, "You don't think so."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatyana Lukyanov, resident of apartment No 3.
The object is on the state depository, but money for its maintenance is not allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits that the authorities simply forgot about.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still lean-poor, but the foundation is all rotten.
Many residents still go to the toilet outside and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can you be happy in such conditions?
The road passes right under the windows, there is not even a pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls back the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows the flow of cars.
You see, the windows are constantly shivering, we can not open the windows, and we are used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to her husband, his hands are golden.
I have two bedrooms and I live with my son.
And other families have much worse conditions, on the second floor in general ceilings a little more than one and a half meters high.
To contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile says:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: my husband and daughter with a granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila looks around the room: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "G"; on one of them there is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the plumbing system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila talks about her apartment everyday and surprisingly at the same time, as an Italian woman, whose house stands on the Roman ruins.
That is, it boils down to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The plumbing was carried out about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a corner and a toilet from a former closet.
We live right where Demidov lived with his family, on the second floor there lived servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
The Ufa Real Estate Center says that privatization does not matter.
We will still get only a one-room apartment, we can not claim more.
Four months ago, they promised to resettle us, but it did not go beyond the promises.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything has happened during this time.
For example, large rats ran in the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are meter-thick!
They say the solution was mixed on eggs, which is why it lasts so long.
The house was built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Probably only because no one has been killed by the collapsed ceiling or his own.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, as in a well.
They say that it is - under our room a secret ravine and the passage to the river Bela, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that it was possible to hide from danger, in case of what.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begging them to let him start excavating in the apartment.
And then he persuaded them to give them the living space in exchange for his odnushka on October Avenue.
Lyudmila refused the historian:
Where are the four of us?
And here, at least a tiny hope that will give housing more spacious.
If we agreed to the exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the old family did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream was to be resettled, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, her large family lives.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see what the conditions are.
The plaster falls off in pieces, like window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is only cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the spouses of Lavrentyev from apartment No. 4 were the most lucky.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
The room is 75 square meters, three people are registered.
We live in the rooms where Suvorov, according to legend, stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks at the seams, falls apart, collapses.
Neighbors have already told me!
The most torment we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the earth literally slipped from under our feet.
I put up supports, wedges; there is nothing in the hall yet, and in the other room we walk, as we swing on the rocks, everything is so fragile.
About the house of the merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.
The gold-industrialist treats him as a native, speaks of him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of Kaginsky and Uzyansky factories built houses, cast guns and bells, held Ural mines.
The heirs of merchant real estate are proud of their ancestor, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around stood wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, we wanted to clean our house, but something prevented us from doing it.
History repeated itself in 2014: again lured to new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, bypassed the necessary authorities, and suddenly learned that the move to apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
Residential officials did not accept it.
They were sent from one table to another, and then, as a mockery, they issued a paper without signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of tenants."
I even have the feeling that our house is not in the plan of the city for a long time, because first it was under the number 57, then it became 57 A, and now it is 57/1.
It's like it was taken down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the head of the information and analytical work of the management of land resources of Ufa Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be held responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, but I do know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
Residents will soon be resettled in new apartments.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy there is an architectural biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016, the entire former Old Kazan street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will have a proper look, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house will most likely become a museum open to everyone.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street on weekends pedestrian.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic in the city.
Vladimir Barabash promises to resettle people from the future museum in 2015.
However, it is unlikely that they will be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye due to a thunderstorm began a forest fire
Dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting sectional forest in the Pozhar district of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, the grouping of forces and means is being built up.
According to the management of the KGSBU "Primorskaya Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Chief of Air Base:
The fire, which occurred in hard-to-reach terrain, was detected by an observer pilot aboard an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
Burning wood residue on an old burner.
The strong congestion of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of paratrooper-fire sites suitable for landing create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the air base by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After detecting the fire at the place of extinguishing were quickly landed 4 parachute firefighters.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and means of fire extinguishing.
In the area of lunch, 3 paratroopers-firefighters were delivered by helicopter to the area of the village of Okhotnichy.
As soon as the landing site for the helicopter in the area of fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, according to the website of the Primorsky Krai administration.

I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica to Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses the comedy, Rudy's Rare Plates, which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to get through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, moreover, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop making noise.
Get away from your sister.
Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, went to a pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was the kind of relentless guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although conditions were better than in his father's day, he was able to take a look at what his life must have been like.
Now there is a little better, but it is dark, smoky, deep labyrinths of hell with flashes of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.
My father got into the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing to himself because he wanted to wash himself away from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing this for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of his childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
It wasn't until my mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, by Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying, "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry's mother had diabetes.
He was one of the things that killed her.
So when I got really, really well and I had diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You need to take radical action.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to go on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry's career trajectory shift is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-haired beard.
Since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has been fully immersed in the theater.
It was followed by “Comedy of Errors” and then “Fences” by Auguste Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ noticed him parodying on stage, and wrote about him in "New Faces".
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time, I was the only black parodist/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very difficult.
Lenny in "New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the Black and White Minstrels Show, an easy entertainment program in which people "blacked their faces", Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I seem to wish it never happened to me, but I don’t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, reprehensible position, I worked on large platforms and learned to work with the crowd.
But what had been “an award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody of black people.”
Introducing characters who mocked and sung the culture of blacks in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!.
The commercials, documentaries, TV series and movie roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his BBC series "LennyHenry.tv" in 2008, he thought, "What are you going to do next, Len, because it seems a little bit like you're dragging your time or slowly rolling it aside?"
Then there was a series of documentary shows on Radio 4 called "What's good about...?"
The first one was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I can’t say I was taught that in school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the prerogative of middle-class white people with pantyhose and cabbage at the bottom in front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You should try.
Don't swear until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from Othello's last monologue for documentary transmission, and he was hooked.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been fixed.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I was reading this play months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
They seemed to be waiting for disaster, but it didn’t happen.
Soon we started the “Comedy of Errors.”
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I just couldn’t believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the public.
"A quiet voice inside me said, 'You'll have to work 10 minutes while they're doing the computer.'"
Instead, the director's assistant announced that the performance would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else handle this.
"You play in the play, stay in the role."
Henry in "Fences" at Dasches Theatre
Learning the text for "Fences" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, “That’s what you need to do.”
He says it in a loud voice, of course.
So I'm holding on to this.
I really love it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still thinks like a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts and ends parodying.
I just decided not to work in the booth, because this thing with getting instant rewards from a full room of strangers, I think, is quite dangerous.
If you keep trying to do this, it can lead to a dead end.
I sometimes work on "Apollo Live" whenever I want to, but mostly I don't get as much pleasure as I used to.
I wonder if he'll give the stand-up tour any more.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle, and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya Registers Civil Servants to Identify ‘Invisible Workers’
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all civil servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to reduce corruption in state structures since coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month was lost due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial irregularities.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow to bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the public service, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, said.
All civil servants must appear within the next two weeks at the identification centers to ensure that their data is collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do so without good reason will be deleted from the payment statement, it is reported.
“This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the civil service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government – hence ending the problem of invisible workers,” said Anne Waiguru, secretary of the cabinet of ministers for planning and structuring of power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with “conspiracy” against the government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
The police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hürriet Daily News.
Some of them participated in corruption detection activities last December, which were aimed at screening government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of forming an organized criminal group and eavesdropping on the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There, he told expectant reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he would do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On the first of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs
It is followed by a plume of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner circles of the Tori Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in leadership positions.
Her career began at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, stepping down when a senior male colleague at Pearson's head company took a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are close to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
His political outlook is also strong.
It was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband was Tory's former counselor.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman's job a poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two orientations: inside as the upper level of the BBC’s governance hierarchy, but also outside as a voice of public anxiety and excitement when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which needs a complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk to come, crushing and destroying the institution is as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself deprives himself of work in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It wouldn’t be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size after reviewing its powers, finances, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cosy old habits, inevitable negotiations about the cost of a license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, Britons acquire a stake in what is definitely the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: she states that her work results cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
Moreover, it is obvious that the popularity of Beeb is growing: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The BBC’s viewing and usage patterns have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope he found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by someone extraneous
A tweet from Republican Governor Rick Perry’s confirmed account on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a Democrat district attorney who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account that was written by someone else.
“I don’t approve of this tweet, and I removed it,” a later post said.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to messages asking for comment.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry’s verified account, it was unclear who was actually doing the posting in that tape.
An earlier tweet contained an unflattering cartoon of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry banned funding for her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
The caption reads: “I don’t always drive a car intoxicated, three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood, but when I do, I charge Governor Perry for telling me about it.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge handling the case to reject the indictment, saying the law, which is used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas, will be vague, contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding $7.5 million from the state’s Department of Public Control, which is based in Travis County and is pursuing corruption in Texas’ public sector when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto sparked an official complaint from a left-wing public control group.
Perry’s confirmed account feed is often updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Arriving fifth at the party's congress in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might step out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and saying, "Here we are, South Carolina!"
Berkeley says real estate market is back to “normal”
One of London’s most prominent developers has warned that the real estate market in southeast England has “returned” to normal activity levels.
Houses in the capital have been the subject of busy demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage loans in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the elite construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013, adding that this has provided a ‘stable working environment’.
London’s real estate market has excelled during the downturn as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly overtaking the average of 6.7 per cent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for Berkeley’s private, affordable, and student schemes rose about one-fifth last year, reaching <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London’s real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also been stalled by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “mansion tax” ahead of next May’s general election.
London-based real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that April’s mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher loan conditions, would also lead to a decline in market growth for both real estate purchases and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has reduced its forecast for London property prices to 3% in 2015, based on the fact that the mood of real estate prices has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes meanwhile fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added: “Demand for the right product with a good design and the best location has remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the term have remained.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April – almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose 40 percent year-on-year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenues up 18 percent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday ahead of the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said Berkeley’s expected earnings for the year would be in line with current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, the profit is expected for the entire year before taxes of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million.
Berkeley’s stock price was held at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards ceremony.
Photos of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalog" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the star of the “Hunger Games” confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real, and condemned the hacker for “brazen invasion of personal space”.
Law enforcement has been contacted, and they will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo sharing site, were allegedly obtained due to the lack of Apple’s iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalog” of the victims of the hacking includes the names of dozens of celebrity women, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Bushed.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are genuine, although “Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone” star Winstead also condemned the hacking on Twitter.
"To those who look at the photos that my husband and I took a few years ago of being alone at home, I hope you're proud of yourself," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickolodeon's "iCarly" and "Victory Winner" refuted what she had in the photos, tweeting: "These so-called nude photos of me are FALSE, people.
Let me stop this in the bud. *clampdown intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the photos in which she is supposed to be genuine.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson’s new novel about love and the letter “J” that has garnered critical acclaim.
They dissolved, best of all, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.
Only sometimes did the woman tell him that he was too serious, heavy in communication, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability in himself.
He was barbed like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this thornyness was a little novel, from which he expected more than usual to get rid of a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremblingly fragile beauty with swollen hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Roiben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, which Kevern considered her aunt, with the latter inheriting a house in a raw but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were flowing, the spiders were sitting still in the baths, the slimes left their traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was overgrown with weeds like giant cabbage rolls.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, with a secret garden.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is included in the long list of the Booker Prize in 2014.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilynn sat, holding hands, in the broken chairs of his old father, in the midst of the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both connected dispersedly to the cheap console, which provided the country with pacifying music and soothing news, when, looking at her crossed legs,
Your legs are too big.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They weren’t banned — nothing was actually banned — they just weren’t lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word “archaic.”
The public taste did what could never be achieved by orders and precepts, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, culinary books and romance novels, from all the music they chose ballads.
Having become enthusiastic this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and with a coarse comic voice to sing the big legs of Eileenn.
Eileen didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he told her, mechanically applying two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it flew off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
It's the same with wit.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a wit expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, never having heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileenn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
Society was obedient, and this meant that each segment of society agreed with gratitude — the gratitude of those who were saved by fate — with the principle of group disposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent, in temperament and physical characteristics, were well suited for the entertainment and sports sphere – and they sang and ran.
Indians, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took care that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was done with plumbing; what was left of the Greek diaspora was a plate.
The natives of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandfathers did not quickly leave the country, when WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN THE GENERAL HAPPENED, in fear that they would be accused of lighting the flames, in fear, in fact, saying that the flames would devour them next, opened restaurants without a lab.
To each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads before, it was difficult to understand how the insulting words that Kevern had just sung to her could be put to music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of safety.
No word could penetrate through the soundproofing of gigantic leaves like cabbage.
Eileen didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press two fingers against her lips again.
She already thought he was weird.
“It was funny,” he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Kevern's gaze.
In the whole world there was nothing but the land of her ish-black hair.
Nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But it still doesn't explain why you're eating it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I can't say no.
Ankles, maybe a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I like you because you have thick ankles," he tried to say instead.
I'm so perverted.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often led him to embarrassment, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, too, Kevern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons turned red and rose from the sunbed, overturning the console and spilling the wine they were drinking.
Wine made of elderberry, so intoxication could not serve as an excuse.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
You don't like it, though.
He felt sorry for her because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebuked him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in the main features she was similar to the local one.
The same huge ice ocean hit both of them.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN ALL HAPPENED than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand against any woman who dared to refuse them or irritate them.
Stupid head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn't been careful!
The kiss was now the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads the console issued was to kiss her first and then hit her.
Kevern said it was unnecessary to clarify, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons corps showed that he needed to leave.
He climbed out of the chair like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him leave, and from the upper window she watched him leave, and her companion was a man who had weighed himself down.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt the injection of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hand to her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, beaten, all the ability to fight left him - why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single occasion, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above or so, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Ofnau, the unofficial public mood control service, prepared a small report on the persistence of low- and medium-level violence in those parts of the country where it was expected to decrease, if not stop altogether, and the means to do so.
“A lot has been done, and a lot is being done,” she wrote, “to soften the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in the thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these tangled branches and the narrow settlements of the terrain, where, despite the towering spires of the churches, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt in all history.
However, some qualities appear to be ineradicable.
The higher the spire, the lower the passions it gives birth to.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows up stories of even overcome obstacles and announces its fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is also evidence that the new evil is emerging in the country.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” her scientific supervisor said after reading the report in its entirety.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I ask," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are the servants of a society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
It is obvious that you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rude” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to whine about WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN THE GENERAL HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened at all, yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, pink, like flamingos, LED letters echoed the advice Ofnau had given the country for the past quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Conversation is better than silence, the word of song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you’re trying to say,” Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she made sure her scientific supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything except that we haven’t healed as effectively as we convince ourselves.
What worries me is that if we are not prepared, we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that initially led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF THE WHOLE HAPPENED.
Only this time will we cast our anger and mistrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together in a pyramid.
This gesture was meant to mean endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “by calling the actions that our grandfathers committed or didn’t commit ‘mistakes’.
You go too far when you talk about them throwing their “anger” and “distrust” at “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that understanding the past, that is, protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no “us” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of turmoil, that's all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can justify itself well.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it’s good or bad, what’s done is done.
It was then.
There is no need to say anything else, we agree here.
And as no one should be blamed, no one should be excused if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn -
The past is there to make us forget it.
If I can add one word to that,
Luther Rabinovitz's pyramid collapsed.
"I'll look at your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on the way to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove onto the pavement, as described by passers-by, "in malicious rage."
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho Army Says Coup Wasn't Planned; Prime Minister Remains in South Africa
Representatives of Lesotho's army denied the preparations for a coup to overthrow the government, saying they had acted against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane left the country, saying that the country's army surrounded its official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he was threatened with an assassination attempt.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there had been no coup, in fact, but that the army had responded to the threat from the “political fanatics” the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the command of the Lesotho Armed Forces took action, having received several intelligence reports that among the police forces there are some elements that really plan to arm some political, young fanatics of political parties who were ready to cause chaos,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Moniel said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to seize power by force, all indications are that the actions of Lesotho's armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Representatives of the army of Lesotho reported that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital is calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Metsing runs the government in the absence of Tabane.
Tabane said he believed he was being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his unified government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on lease rights at Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for a medical examination.
Last season, he played on the field as part of the London club only three times.
Recall that earlier "Milan" rented from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest Markit business activity index (PMI) of the euro area manufacturing sector fell to 50.7 in August, falling from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates an increase.
New orders have been delayed and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will expect a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with a halt to the recovery of the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation at inflation, which is only 0.3%.
There is a suggestion that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s senior economist.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months, at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
Signs that the momentum of growth has faded in the main industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to fuel analysts waiting for additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news came from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the business activity index of the euro area manufacturing sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “The eurozone’s producers obviously find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with Russia/Ukraine – add uncertainty to the still-difficult conditions in many countries.
This heightened tension has obviously hit the business – and especially consumer confidence – and is likely to lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it was “more and more like” that the ECB would eventually have to carry out some kind of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Residents of Mariupol will expose a living chain against the militias
In Mariupol, until last week, everything was calm - no one dared to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the “militia”.
According to political scientists, the separatists break through to Mariupol to get to the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novoazovsk was taken, which before that was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupol people decided that the Ukrainian army, although it would defend them, had a little against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and carry equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
In the city, shops are gradually closing, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan Survivors: Ten years since the horrific takeover of school, how children who find themselves in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day test that shook the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during a school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific seizure of the Beslan school, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroically survivors of the disaster warned yesterday evening about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, seized and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of a new quarter, it seemed to be something of an extreme degree of possible evil.
The tragedy united East and West in disgust, which miraculously then grew into action and hope for the future in the midst of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan in southern Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death during a school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted adversity, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their biggest hope?
That the war that is now wreaking havoc on Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now cease.
The girl who in the photo tries to climb back into the shelled sports hall
It is captured in a photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one linen tried to climb back into the shelled sports hall after the explosion of a mine.
In confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that they both died, but they actually survived.
“The woman told me to run away, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My feet were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mom.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was fully recovered, but yesterday said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There's a few fragments left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that fact.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, although the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and elsewhere.
When I see a photo on the Internet where I climb into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure that this does not happen again.
A boy who ran through a hail of bullets, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of capture, hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw the crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, said: “Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with injuries to her legs, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After they were reunited, she said, “I was crying with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later brought to London (the now-defunct newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as the Barnardo's Children's Defender by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory it fades.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they're dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted and the ride in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to such grief as he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who last week volunteered at a women's monastery.
I want to help so much.
I want to serve in the police someday and hope to be enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realized then how the people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to Sherry Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I’d like to call Sherry and just tell her that it’s been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borsch, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting them with his water gun, and they were running away and playing with him.
And it's only been a month since our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I think the world hasn’t gotten better in 10 years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just kids like ours.
I think for many people, war is a news story they listen to when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive or evil at all.
He’s not looking for revenge, for example, he’s not fixated on this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to be remembered, but they’re very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
I didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damiru is now 17, he is taller than me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get back on my feet, I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when parts of the bodies were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, 'Damir, run, run,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and ran away.
This is how life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor Georgiy Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and right Georgiy today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he escaped death while Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, took him to school on the first day of school before taking his eldest son Vladimir to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George survived.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time before my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
A photo of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in sculpture (right).
I remember that George wanted so much to go to school that day that he said he wanted to hug the teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of crying George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George says, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that kind of pain.
We need decades to forget her a little.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had nightmares about the seizure, but now I feel better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and entered the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiac surgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years old
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of a terrorist-killer
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-killer during the capture, but still he managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist-killer.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
“We think it was yesterday,” says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB but couldn’t because of the damage his health caused during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids can easily handle bad events - I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006, I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year, it was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I was sitting in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgiy Farniev today with a photo of himself in the hospital after the capture
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
As for my physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I walk normally.
But my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that it was impossible.
My second hobby was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows".
He said, "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know Georgie won't go.
For him, it should be even stronger, because he was there and I was not.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He stays with us.
George is an adult now, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair is happening to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can’t play sports.
I would say that he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift that God could have given me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I also know widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world – wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how come we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If only we could capture all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years old
A child who was moved to a safe place by a special forces soldier
Rescued: Alena Tskaeva is taken to a safe place by a Russian special forces soldier (left).
She is now ten (right), and she does not remember a monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when a Russian policeman carried the little Aljona in his arms from the captured school in Beslan.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, ten-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the gymnasium of the school.
Mahar, who was then three years old, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in a deadly carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they have a young daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, the neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alena and Mahar are both beautiful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a great father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he is looking forward to being able to take the field again in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I’m very happy to play for Borussia Dortmund again,” Kagawa told Bild.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and I look forward to being able to get back on the field in the form of Borussia.
Kagawa transferred to Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he could not establish himself as part of the English club, having spent in two seasons only 38 matches in the championship of England, scored 6 goals and gave 8 effective transfers.
Man accused of hitting a girl on a pedestrian crossing “pelikan” in Fife
A 78-year-old man will face trial on charges of hitting a three-year-old girl at a pelican crossing in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly knocked the girl over at a crossing in Pittenwine in East Newquay.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and hit the girl, resulting in an injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstruther, denied his guilt in Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, a royal lawyer, has set a trial date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not settle in Vladivostok
The Duty Free store at Vladivostok Airport has put up a sign prohibiting a number of world political leaders from making purchases in this store.
Do not get them perfume, vodka and cognac.
The store’s administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Japanese Prime Minister and several other well-known comrades will not be able to get vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
I put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on the appearance in an even less accessible service institution - Dietary canteens MSU, as reported by the website of catering.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a diet cafeteria in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem awfully witty to themselves.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that in the context of the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies in order to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand from buyers.
The advice was given during the visit of the company "Yugpticeprom" company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also gave advice to restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at the proper level.
An annual embargo on food imports has been introduced in Russia since August 7.
Head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - quotes "All sport" Maslakov's words.
The third place is a confirmation of our sufficiently high command level.
It is nice that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It is important to remember that we did not prepare for these competitions.
The season is over and we have not committed our leaders to the DecaNation match.
In recent years, we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have updated the national team.
The French, on the contrary, put up a combat-ready team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly publicly announced.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some types were an order of magnitude lower than in the same "Diamond League".
Season's over.
Of course, athletes are not so important to the result, especially in team-level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it came to the absurd, when at 1500 m men were so fond of tactical intricate running that they showed the result below the average level... women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to take photos or shoot videos underwater, there are a number of equipment options in front of you.
The cheapest option is a waterproof “soap” such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures at a family holiday with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules need to be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’re going to shoot.
Some camera and video cameras have shooting modes or object types that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our customer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots - because many of them will not work.
The "soaphouses" have LCDs that will help you compose photos, while the action cameras usually do not.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and the layout of the frame will be a random process.
So make a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that shoots multiple frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay at the surface when you shoot in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Swim closer to the subject.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important under water due to darkened light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to get close to the shooting objects if you want to fill in the frame.
Bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games in free-fighting Bilal Machov can go to the Greco-Roman fight.
This was announced by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan in free-fighting Sazhid Sazhidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the World Championships in Tashkent in September 2014.
Currently, Bilal Machov is at the meeting of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, by juniors Bilal performed in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championship, he became the winner of the freestyle tournament and the third prize winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on freestyle wrestling.
For a long time there was talk that the new stage of his career our heavyweight will spend in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Makhov can play already at the World Championships in Tashkent - if he wins the disguise.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of person whose personality could shake everything around, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
Counseling anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to getting rid of patients both from the suffering of the disease and from the torments of treatment.
Among those who approached him, recalls his wife, was a MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment are mostly concerned about something completely different – pain.
One day in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I used to,” he wrote last May.
It was hard to find strength in me.
Wrestling with flu-like symptoms, he finds himself annoyed with his wife, Juliet.
“I want things to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left on business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear as to why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do an x-ray of the chest.
Just two weeks earlier, he had skied in the French Alps.
X-ray results have arrived.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it’s hard to pinpoint the exact cause.
Although some smokers develop lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
But with mesothelioma, it's different.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly a cause for concern today.
But that tranquility is wrong.
The UK is now at the peak of the Mesothelioma epidemic.
Here, more people die from mesothelioma than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual mortality rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
The annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and the projected number of deaths in the future in the UK
The reason we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), mesothelioma usually takes decades to develop.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of the specialties of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
Bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, turned out to be no salvation.
The building is asbestos-covered.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have proved to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a pipe insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
“It looks like there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital, where I spent six years in an internship,” he wrote.
All the students, nurses, doctors and loaders used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
"Of the four doctors who have been interned at Guy's hospital and who have subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I'm the only one left alive."
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48 years old.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
To live so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die eight months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK needs to heal itself, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had accidentally exposed Janice Ellen to asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing the clothing department at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
“Before this happened,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I never thought it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that tells them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotil, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in the brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amositis) and blue asbestos (crocidolite).
The UK was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that “there are strong, albeit indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janes Ellen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pito's work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients suggesting that “a significant percentage of mesothelioma when there is no known effect at work or at home was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Much of this impact, he says, is due to “the usual use and impact of the weather” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the very center of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines behind parliamentary committees had been contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as “strong airflows.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament's Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster received "clean sanitary evidence", it has now acknowledged that it is necessary to carry out work on <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion in the reconstruction of parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of parliament may be sitting at the QE2 conference center.
Goddard’s report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed according to different rules.”
It is impossible to know whether this management mistake will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has not been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital that was successfully sued for asbestos,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It is so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly, I started to get feverish.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Janice Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
In the end, he could not go to work for a month.
Confused doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to extract fluid from the lungs and send it for tests.
Yet his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms came back, often after he exercised and breathed heavily.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to him in the emergency room with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and a doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel unwell, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the cavity between his chest shell and his lung shell.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just move on,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma diagnosed
Abbott was suddenly immersed in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where there was often asbestos thermal insulation on pipes," he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now suffering from the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people in atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were found in cellars, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through the pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost certainly exposed to the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turned out that hospitals were a place where, theoretically, they saved lives for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to life for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands
And it’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries, and city halls because of its amazing insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos for the first time in a class.
Across the country, in countless chemistry classes, students installed their Bunsen burners on asbestos stands.
There are websites that highlight the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or shed roofs tend to contain asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful when taking down garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes quite a long time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized that I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I had to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers being confused by the amount of information he needed to receive.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas again.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life — the very act of breathing — that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem arises from inhalation of needle asbestos fibers," Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Guy's hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
The Treasurer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed by an internship at the hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treger says, "breathing pushes them to the periphery where the shell is.
This is essentially an invasive process from the very beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, causes hot controversies.
Some people think it’s worth a try.
The Treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut a pleura," he says.
It is impossible to walk around with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer is “not very well suited to chemotherapy,” which “acts” but doesn’t cure.
“From time to time, there are patients who live long,” says Treger.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Stephen J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he fell ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a support and counseling office for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed four years ago and is still very energetic.
Abbott was first offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by only a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "tried to give everything a slightly more positive color".
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunsky, professor of thoracic surgery at Guy's hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need a direction, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham said.
The average patient would have to get referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best of the available treatments.
However, when such treatment finally proves to be ineffective, many sufferers face another financial concern – about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan said.
But what changed in the 1960s was that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that we talked about the dishonesty of the companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled the case, but it was not a "full-value settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not unequivocally prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's hospital.
After the investigation of his death, a spokesman for Guy's hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the cellars in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking lethal contact with asbestos to one company or place of work – usually decades after that – has proven to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma who require compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
Insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that they have time on their side, which, of course, the plaintiffs do not have.
In response, this year came serious new legislation that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to collect compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry was created for those diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who has no one to sue.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a normal compensation case – about <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with mesothelioma patients, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represents a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“It’s a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if a time interval had not intervened and patients with mesothelioma could track down companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labor and Pensions, has admitted that the law is “unperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven people dying every day, quick action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during a second reading of the Mesothelioma Bill last December.
By that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky can boast as much as 40 percent of the surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is a power that supports you.
When you give up, things can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no sign of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I was supposed to be 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of tumors now.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about showing your wife how a timer works on a boiler.
When you get bad news, you become sad.
We have to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it's not always easy.
"It's hard for a parent," he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease, which means I wouldn’t live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a gloomy certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that does not ignite.
I saw the napkins he made smoldering in the fireplaces at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and are therefore denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke testifies that the particles of asbestos in her lungs “were, without a doubt, the main cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding developed intensively, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary Industrial Ban on Blue Asbestos Imports
The Court of Appeals upholds the first successful claim for health damage caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
Global production of asbestos grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires that all contractors working with asbestos be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is prohibited in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the UK.
A <0xC2><0xA3>350 million compensation scheme has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is at around 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament decided on Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
The move is likely to start long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the National People’s Congress, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It hasn’t fooled our expectations, but it still drives us mad,” said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, said allowing a nationwide nomination for the Hong Kong leader’s election would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the UK handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by voting starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to directly vote; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a nominee commission tightly controlled by Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and most widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over the years took place.
Behind much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, which has threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of Occupy Central gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise to the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with public authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement “considered seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
It is with great regret that we announce that all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Public authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures were tightened at government headquarters on Sunday, involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the riots is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of residents from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are putting Hong Kong’s business lifeline at risk.
“The protest they’re talking about could result in major economic damage depending on how many people will participate and how long,” said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticised the movement.
We don’t want to spread concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is an idea that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state-run media also reported in recent days that Hong Kong’s democratic movement activists were shown by saboteurs sent by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which attracted 780,000 voters - more than one-fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American culture of proms reaches university life: first-year students were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of the arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said that the service thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping this year’s students get to university with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
The company said that since the service has just been launched, no orders have yet been received, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also said that despite the fact that students face the need to pay for tuition of <0xC2><0xA3>9000 per year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized the service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS’s vice president of higher education, said: “This project seems incredibly disconnected from the lives of most students.
Many students who start university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to meet the rapidly rising costs of basic needs before they can even begin to think about taking out thousands of pounds for something like a simple hostel arrival.
Feminists raise issues of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who come raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in internet conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and drew national attention, Pérez saw the responses of white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as “Thoughts of Ferguson on behalf of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about oppression of women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin and privilege at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis that we are facing, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so tied to race, they felt they needed to point it out.
For the professor of English at Ohio State University, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, silence deafens.
“Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
In her view, black women are in a position to clearly share these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women now combine issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason for this was almost always the rape of a white woman,” Hattery said.
It took a white woman to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, such as Susan B. Anthony, studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would only be effective for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and voting rights for blacks should come later,” Hattery said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynchings in the Southern Women’s Association for the prevention of lynchings.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” with the problems that black women have dealt with over several generations.
“Would it be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?”
The second-wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took advantage of Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown and published a sharp article by the Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in protests on racism issues.
“I hope that women who have another but similar reason to understand the dangers inherent in the body — and perspectives on racial issues that differ significantly in public opinion polls — will be at the forefront of change,” Steinem wrote.
While Steinem stands for more intersecting feminism, which includes both race and gender issues, her commentary on race in America still surprises some.
American Business Institute researcher Christina Sommers, author of Who Stole Feminism?, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Guardian to My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and Hispanic youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem pushing the front line of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested some 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has once again surfaced – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said she only needed to share stories of immigrant women in order to present the issue as important to women.
“They speak for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued [to male immigrants], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories are resonating with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" is for sale
A photo of the house put up for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Put up for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, a separate one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - which depicted a pig with its head resting on the sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been deleted," a company spokesperson said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as a "unique one-bedroom detached house".
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still stored in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the fourth round of the US Open conceded Karolina Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, Vasily OSIPOV reports from New York.
How will you overall assess your performance at this year’s Grand Slam tournaments?
“Of course I’m glad I managed to win at Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Now, of course, I'm upset.
I couldn’t even get to the quarterfinals.
What are your goals for the rest of the season?
After an insulting defeat, I have a huge motivation to reach a new level.
I have a lot to work on, and I’m going to do my best to finish the year with dignity.
The Asian series of tournaments starts in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuyev proposed for the implementation of the GTO rules to give bonuses when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the standards for pulling, running and other exercises.
We will remind, 12 subjects of Russia will begin to implement from September 1 on their territory the norms of the GTO.
I also suggested to the schoolchildren who passed the GTO, to give bonuses when entering universities, - said Valuyev.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to give additional leave to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey in South Wales appeared a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from the lottery on Saturday night.
The Harvey Kiosk brings gold to the main prize draw for the second time in five years, with a previous win of $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win sparked a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the top prize last month, marking the end of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, Canning Vale became one of five millionaires in August, following the couple’s $7.5 million win from Belmont just weeks earlier.
The winning couple have been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.

The Ministry of economic development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show in 2014.
The plan was drafted on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
The document is expected to be adopted in late September - early October, Pluzhnikov says, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available at Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.
It is necessary to develop criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport and to decide how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric vehicles, will be prepared by December 2014; the preferential lending and preferential leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of cars, stimulate localization and create service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to amend the regulations to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities in 2015 to also encourage the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with an advantage in driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include criteria in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The market of electric cars in Russia is still being formed - in 2013 about 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars was nullified, so sales will be about 500 pieces, predicts the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold increase does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, in Russia, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing - the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Renault's Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships in Russia Nicolas Remiz.
Most of the other electric vehicle manufacturers have taken a wait-and-see position on Russia.
The development of electric vehicles is also at the Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "" but the output is miserable.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, admits the director of "AvtoVAZ" for engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the high cost of cars (the electric cars sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) restrains the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (refueling stations - units), says CEO of "Autostat" Sergey Tselikov.
Due to the high cost and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorev" Mikhail Potozhansky, Tselikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional ones.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that “electric mobility” is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of more and more new charging stations, emphasizes the President of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are being implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, and about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of a network of gas stations are underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofiin, director of the Rosseti department, the company believes in the electric car market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.
In addition, "Rosseti" as a network company does not have the right to sell electricity, the possibility of doing so in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the market of electric vehicles in Russia is the nullification of customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, expansion of the preferential list is being worked out.
Replacing the transport tax with an environmental tax (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov said.
Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric cars - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, incentives for car owners are also needed, for example, free parking in the city center (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov is sure, or the possibility of moving electric cars along dedicated lanes, which Russia does not yet have.
A private jet crashed in Colorado.
A single-engine Piper PA-46 plane crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three out of five people in it died, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being determined.
In the Donetsk region deal with prisoners of the militants of the battalion "Donbass".
The pharaohs were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces died under fire.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the southeast of Ukraine really was, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The karats of the Donbass battalion remained alive after the “meat grinder” into which they got near Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, effectively abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters reported that it was possible to get out of the ring through the supposedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But just a few minutes later, shells and bullets were whistling from all sides.
"Judging by the information that I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to leave," said the acting deputy battalion commander, who has the call sign "Lermontov".
And when we went down to the lowland between Polypol and Chervonoselsky, we started a crossfire with anti-tank guided missiles, with "snakes", grenade launchers 30-mm, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call sign “Lermontov” says: almost immediately at least 60 people died, dozens were injured, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they have come to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give food, medicines.
While their own commanders actually deceived them and doomed them to a certain death.
They betrayed us, they said.
A column, an entire battalion, to be destroyed.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexey volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news told about the atrocities that allegedly committed in the southeast "separatists".
Alexis saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk, not by anyone, but by the Ukrainian military.
A friend of mine called me, told me that mortar shelling was going on, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexey.
After that, I wanted to leave the battalion.
They didn't let us out of Ilovaisk, they said we were in a ring.
I've already arranged with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately transported from Zurakhovo to Ilovaysk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cauldron" near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if it was possible to turn back time, they would not join the punitive battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a headquarters for limiting the prices of products

<0xE2><0x86><0x90> Will Kiev “Rosneft” compensate for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of Lisichanskoye refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansk refinery was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no fighting, there were no ‘dumped insurgents’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, technological oil pumped into pipes has disappeared," he said.
Recall that on July 18, in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk oil refinery, a tank for oil storage was burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisichansk Refinery is the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was commissioned in October 1976.
The total capacity of Lisichansk Refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as batches of diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to Lisichansk Refinery were suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk Refinery along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BP.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile towards the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
According to Interfax, the Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both Russian indices and the position of the national currency may be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will sue "Ideal Tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" presented "Ideal-tour" lawsuits totaling 4.7 billion rubles.
We are talking about two cases, which will be held in October.
The cases will be dealt with by different judges.

Twitter is trying to be more interesting for new users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the process of user registration to quickly engage new members in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have abandoned their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will view a large number of accounts recommended by the service during registration to immediately compose their reading circle.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests specified in the registration.
In this case, Twitter automatically sets the subscription checkbox for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to remove the checkboxes himself, so as not to read those who are not interested in him.
If earlier users of the microblogging service saw only avatars of recommended users, now Twitter displays a sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help make an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service.
Such activity is associated, first of all, with the continued attempts of the service to achieve break-even.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in the growth of the user base and a fall in the activity of readers.
The company is in desperate need of more resource-loyal consumers who would stay for a long time if they came in once.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising resources.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be brittle and rainy

The car recycling program resumed on September 1
From September 1 in Russia, the program for the recycling of cars is resumed.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits that have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all cars over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo.
Previously, in Russia, there was already a similar program of recycling cars.
The main difference of the current project, the Minister explained, is that now it is assumed not only the recycling of cars to receive a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to buy a new one with a discount when handing over the old one to the "trade-in" from the dealer, Interfax reports.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
Creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He talked about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case began working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has become widely known only now.
The game was inspired by the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place, which began after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a name, will be how the information coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where there are clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take a different picture of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police look like heroes and the protesters look like bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where the ordinary person can not go.
If he were to cover events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive riot.
Points in the game will need to be scored using the hero's Twitter, in which new followers will appear, if the photos posted there are popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and the platform on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how the event could change depending on how the photo about him was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to devote it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make the game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Geletei draws Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
By calling to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Geletey draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
In Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Geletey, who said about the "completed operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists" and the beginning of the "Great Patriotic War", the losses in which will be counted "tens of thousands".
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his Facebook page the mentioned post, is a subject for the study of specialists not in the military field”, – stated in the message of the Russian diplomats.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, Ukraine’s defense minister wrote on Monday: “The Russian side has already threatened several times that in case of continued resistance they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us.”
At the same time, he said that the “operation to liberate eastern Ukraine” was completed.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Prayuth (right) appointed Pravit Wongsuwan (left) as Defense Minister
Thailand's military ruler and prime minister, General Prayut Chan-Ocha, has announced the composition of the country's new cabinet, which holds more than a third of the posts of generals or retired generals.
Representatives of the army received key positions: Ministers of Defense, Finance, Foreign Affairs and Trade.
On Monday, Prayut Chan-Ocha was officially confirmed as Prime Minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government to this post.
The 60-year-old military man who seized power in a bloodless coup on May 22 was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected prime minister at a parliamentary meeting.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
Prayuth Chan-och said the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Chinawat.
Prayut Chan-Ocha will officially be interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to consolidate its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
against the backdrop of total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were provisionally arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested leading politicians of the country, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army ousted Yinglyk’s brother Chinawat Taksin as prime minister.
Both are popular among the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many members of the middle class and the metropolitan elite have joined an anti-government movement that has paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the mussels will be better in the salad, I did not promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm brasserie is pissing off.
It is necessary to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain inflexible.
After all, everyone has long known that we say "Belgium" - we mean mussels, we say "mussels" - we mean "Belgium".
Restorers like to state that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are such places located not so that it is good, but even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "City" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bozhole" and beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, and Belgian.
Above the ground is located only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is devoid of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where the mermaids swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg are no longer a novelty, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of bottling beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottles (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "mussels are hearty big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, that is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, can predict that meat roll with Walloon prunes (280 rubles) - in fact carpaccio, cut in addition so thin that parchment paper compared to him will seem filthy thick matter.
You can feel at least some taste only if you swirl together a half plate.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge (260) would most correctly be considered a crime against the Belgian people: some rotten iceberg, boiled once a long time ago potatoes, sour Kenyan beans, reddish bacon chips, plus some marinated onions.
You won't want anyone to see you with a salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If unripe quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked champignons could still close their eyes, then why do mussels look like they have been thawed and boiled several times in their lives!
After all, I already know that there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in pans "in a sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Sauces half a dozen, the one that made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not ask.
There are vegetables, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, and remained a mystery.
But good fries relying on mussels with homemade mayonnaise.
Chicken water here is not bread, thick to the point that depending on the mood you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice cream soup.
It was claimed that the rabbit was cooked in a beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
In fact, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary stifled everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his life was fed exclusively rosemary bushes, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust was attached to the rabbit's leg.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also hearty - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Maple sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and waffles are dry.
But the manager approached the table very informally asked about the lunch impressions.
Then you should come again.
The exchange rate of the dollar has risen to the IMF above 37 rubles on the news of the West preparing new sanctions against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculations "tomorrow" by 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the euro exchange rate rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to the Moscow Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House reported that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are discussing the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both paired with the euro and paired with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says Anna Bodrova, a senior analyst at Alpari.
Everything that is related to Ukraine, in one way or another, will be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed on either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news yesterday was crossed out.
The week, according to the forecasts of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links of the same chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate: current prices for the autumn will add from 5 to 10%.
Soon, moreover, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be some vacuum as the networks refocus on other suppliers.
"The dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no powerful hysteria," - says the head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuyev.
They will still be watching whether they will impose the promised sanctions on Saturday, how NATO will meet.
The ruble, he said, fell sharply after the end of the tax season, then the news was sent to Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it is fully moving to the floating exchange rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous one during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - the analyst continues.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Worrying times for the foreign exchange market were, I will remind, when at the end of January there was an increased demand for currency, as well as on March 3, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to the increase in import prices, says Alexey Kozlov, chief analyst of UFS IC.
The negative points can be attributed to the rise in import goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause an increase in the cost of borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country’s economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothes the decline in stock prices, expressed in rubles.
For example, the IMF Index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s trading, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative size of the decline in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, emotions are gradually disappearing, and the quotations of the ruble partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles per dollar," Alexei Kozlov said.
A genetic disorder is often misdiagnosed.
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karin Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she only had a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (SMT), a group of hereditary disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait, and clenched toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not cured and progresses, which means that the symptoms intensify over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich Ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be chained to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two, who is now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what the others did.
I fell every day, and it took me more time.
I was never able to ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied a lot in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical card when her doctor left the room and it said she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I put my nose where I shouldn’t, and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this condition in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in that interval.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd be in a wheelchair by now."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life.
After several genetic tests, she was found to have CMT.
“When he explained what CMT was, I thought I pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The charity SMT UK announced a month of information about the SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
The tax burden on entrepreneurs of the Washington zone is growing as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country rose moderately last year, when economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion to the state treasury and locally in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on state and local businesses rose 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after years of contraction in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes levied by the state rose faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56 percent, are from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's tax revenues are from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the smallest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the increase in tax revenues is driven by a return to the previous level of the company’s real estate value, the researchers say, which raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.
While a large share of this revenue comes from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same thing is happening in the Washington zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 — a 4.2 percent increase from the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate has no similar effect on rising state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of the state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base around District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a nonprofit organization that doesn’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services as there are in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also seem to be improving, according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a $2.3 billion corporate income tax at the state level, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
Although trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase at the same rate in all three localities.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while the growth rate in Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 per cent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of the three jurisdictions (each having the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 per cent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 per cent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for state and local entrepreneurs and, in general, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs even up to 3% by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington zone seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes by state and local level, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners – the transitional structure that has arranged most small businesses – in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher growth rate than taxes for entrepreneurs as a whole.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to continue this year, with turnover tax revenues in state and local governments rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington zone may lag behind, as the reduction in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world judo championship brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians lost only to the main favorite of the competition - the Japanese team.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who competed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaytar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one observation received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won.
In men's competitions in the category of up to 66 kg of silver went to Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze - Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian lost to the world champion in 2011 and 2013, the Japanese Masashi Ebinum.
Khan-Magomedov, at the quarterfinal stage, who lost to his compatriot, won a consolation tournament and won a bronze award.
In the women's tournament category up to 52 kg also reached the third stage of the pedestal of honor Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-finals, she lost to current world champion Mailinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who competed under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for bronze, Kuzyutina won from Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament, she still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again, the obstacle on the way of the Russians to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category of up to 73 kg, put bronze in the Russian national team's pocket.
In the quarter-finals, his offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, now playing for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two battles and became the winner of the award.
Mozhshkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal in the near future, so he will take a pause in the competition.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal at this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who accepted the UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in the category of up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category of up to 81 kg was won by Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt due to a remark from his opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament to 90 kg.
Its owner was Kirill Questions, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his competitor in the comforting final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the rival Qytova could not get out on the tatami due to injury.
Men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the savings of the national team by Renat Saidov, who competed in the category of more than 100 kg.
In the comforting final, he won a clean victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played out.
Both Russian national teams - both male and female - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the fair sex was not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judokas won the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation, they in a persistent struggle with the score of 2-3 lost to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian national team led 2-0 after the net victory of Khan-Magomedov and the volleyball - Denis Yartsev (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals could not cope Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100).
According to the same scenario, the bronze match in the women's tournament developed, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, lost to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by the President of Russia Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's national team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, the founders of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I'm sure you can win from them.
The Russian national team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals - one silver and two bronzes.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isaev.
Of course, we are all maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let's remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo," Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko summed up the results of the tournament, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
The Japanese national team is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, having won 11 medals of various merits, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

Joan Rivers' family hopes for the best
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call saying she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources said.
Doctors intentionally keep her under anesthesia and strict supervision until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "severe".
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Kings can all.
On sale is the debut album of the group Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, brought rock duets from clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo are only a year on the stage, but already have a nomination for the BBC Music Award, a tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the dressing room of the New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before its release received 100,000 pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the ordinary, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duet of bullish-looking Brits playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last fashionable a couple of decades ago.
In general, the bets on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and have already been quite justified.
The duo did not in vain take a name that could be encroached on before, except that quite desperate hairy metalists, and the blood of which kings flow, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
We are talking, of course, first of all about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood set their goal to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, taking it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is perhaps too early, but something can already be asserted.
A dozen songs in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer’s talent as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the advantages of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drum party.
Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to sing than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quotation in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock fans, but when played in a row, they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it is not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (presumably the successors of Motörhead), but have drawn numerous rock duets from the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously tight.
The secret is in part in the cunning use of bass, replacing the guitar in the usual format invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it is not only about the instruments, but also about the very approach to composing songs.
The heroes of the Zero Retrorock with great difficulty went beyond the postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and brazen that this effort successfully drapes some of the secondaryness and hardness of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: An online store — and a video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying Twitch’s streaming video playback service for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The news came as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch video service Google for a good billion looked completely ready, and such a combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set a goal to be a general-purpose streaming service – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which omniscients give (mainly old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theater", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of an entrenched technology company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, according to reports, it was willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have so far is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shire: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who claim to be better at sports than watching it, it’s hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking a joystick.
It’s one thing to look over a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching their shooting without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a recipe for a headache worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about the virtuosity of the game or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, making it the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
How will Amazon benefit from this?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch curling up on Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would love to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of games,” and this channel does not give signs of fading, even – oh – as a spectacular sport.
The attack in 2004 killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked with the surviving hostages - almost all students, with the parents of the victims, with the cemetery supervisor - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations, - says the correspondent of the department "Society" Anton.
Already returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the President for the North Caucasus and negotiated with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the "B" of the FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What shocked me most during my time working on this topic is that in Beslan, it was as if there had not been these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But it is impossible to forget Beslan, and I hope that we have done our job," Antonova said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
Previous special projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
North Korea launched a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports "Renhap".
The launch was made around 10:30 a.m. local time from Chagando province, on the border between North Korea and China.
Presumably, the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, said the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea.
MPs proposed to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
In case of success of the initiative, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015
The State Duma introduced a draft law that provides for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is located in the legislative framework of the lower house.
Its authors were deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Fair Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to more rapid and effective ensuring of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the protection of personal data and compliance with the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunication networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is hastened by parliamentarians, obliges to store in the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, refine and extract personal data of Russian citizens in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called "black lists" of violators' sites - an automated information system "Register of Violators of the Rights of Personal Data Subjects".
This law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrey Lugovoi and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation, will have to pay for rent
Commenting on the draft law submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he sees no problems for the postponement of the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, “from Rostelecom”, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, Mail Group, Western companies that now provide their servers.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see any problems - they will receive technological opportunities for placement," Levin said.
Disputed Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Electronic Communications Association expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services for flights and hotels.
According to the Association, "the bill deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data by imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation."
The RAEC statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording takes place, the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, he will be able to choose in which territory the specified actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the abandonment of global services and significant economic losses.
The participant of the test with a bucket of ice water dislocated the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK screamed so much when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test of the bucket of ice water went to the pain wrong.
The woman was hospitalized after she screamed so much during a bucket of ice water that her jaw dislocated.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so furiously when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck,” she told The Mirror.
The water is pouring on a 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts in the Seconds Before the Accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn’t close, it got stuck, and then I realized that something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they began to murmur, but I had to urgently take to the emergency room.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to the hospital to straighten her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The video became an internet sensation and was posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Militants handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The “Army of Novorossia” claim that shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy in violation of the ceasefire agreement
On September 1, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 killed soldiers.
This was reported to Interfax by the representative of the press service of the “Army of Novorossia”.
He added that “the air defense forces in the area of the village of Mereshki shot down a Su-27 aircraft that violated the ceasefire agreements.”
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side during the artillery shelling of the Luhansk airport used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
The representative of the press service noted that the militia managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian air force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition warehouses.
"Losses in the enemy's life force - up to one hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered 13 people," - said the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side in compliance with the ceasefire.
At the same time, at night, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossia", "interrupted the attempt of the national guards in violation of previously reached agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the surrounding area".
Then the militia reported the destruction of two tanks and two IFVs in a short-lived battle, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, the total losses of the enemy in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored fighting vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaysk region of Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the leadership of the “people’s republics” to release Ukrainian soldiers from the encirclement.
The DPR agreed to do so on condition of surrender of weapons and ammunition to the enemy.
The first dozen soldiers began to leave the encircled settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the surrounded by the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, on Sunday night from the "boiler" left another 14 people.
On his Facebook page, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded were "captured by 137 regiments of 32 divisions of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigade of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Russian Defense Ministry denied reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures in case of introduction of new EU sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on “absolutely unproven allegations of the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country,” the ministry said on its website.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, succumbs to the influence of countries that are interested in intensifying confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the opposing parties," the ministry stressed.
It is also noted on the website of the department that there are currently no objective assessments of the humanitarian situation in the Donbass, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
It should be recalled that in the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against Russia.
At the same time, EU representatives work closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate with each other the measures introduced in terms of duration and degree of rigidity.
New EU sanctions could affect energy and the financial sector.
Also, the Australian government announced an extension of sanctions against Russia in the field of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Ways to Save Money on University Textbooks
Although the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second year, came up with a clever way to reduce costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation so that they postponed their sale.
“My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the Council of Colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to Schröder’s system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for a semester, and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rentals has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores during the last spring semester were rented, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Shopping in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 per ticket, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Buying a used
If you don’t mind other people’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in second-hand form on Chegg.com.
Matt Caseday, a 25-year-old fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a second-hand copy of “Strategic Decisions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of the Advertising Business.”
The book sold for $48.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracey, director of the College without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, invites students to check with their professors whether they should use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are insignificant for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found at a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Lease
It is worth thinking about how to rent textbooks, if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to keep them to yourself after the course is completed.
You can save more than 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any fines you may be issued for marks, underscores, and damages.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of a new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented, acquiring an electronic license for a certain period from distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The rental of "Mathematical Analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $ 61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most favorable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, take a look around.
Joe Golt, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using the ISBN number to find out the price of the book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before ordering online, says Golt, be sure to check if the book is really in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the complete inefficiency of the fund for the development of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, Interfax reports.
“15 billion rubles remained on deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to speed up the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, until July 1, has not approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, lifting infrastructure restrictions - both in the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investments to the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive with regard to the key business centers of the Asia-Pacific region, the President stressed.
Earlier it was reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the SEZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save the Cash Fees
Sylvester Stallone’s “Unstoppable 3” returned less than $30 million from its $90 million U.S. budget, while “The City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz’s “home video” brought in just $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children’s films like “How to Train Your Dragon 2” also disappoint with the proceeds.
Telegraph critic Robbie Collin's article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be the poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in history in terms of children's films, and called "How to Train Your Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" sequel to fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at an audience of a slightly older age, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between Memorial Day in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film spectators and film critics, suggest that the harvest of films this year is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that it may be about changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney film Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was before.
Unlike the current drop in Hollywood box office fees, Netflix’s streaming revenue reached $1.2 billion, nearly double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was some truth in his dark predictions.
Due to the fact that several potential box office hits are expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minionov and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in box office fees simply “cyclical,” telling a Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the highest-grossing summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Food sanctions do not frighten owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
And in general, the general public prefers to replace prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” said Italian restaurant chef Barlotti Mariano Valerio, who is concerned about the quality of the cheeses offered to him by suppliers in exchange for Italian ones.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Parmesan supplies should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Switching to Russian?
In 2005, I was in the Dorogomilov market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes, which is clear: shocking memories do not let him go until now.
The meat was lying on carts just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe everything's changed now.
But the other day they brought me fish from the Far East to test.
So she turned out to be dead!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many ordinary things for Italy are strange for the Russian manufacturer.
A few years ago, I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is suspended in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang in order to become soft, so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, "Where did you get this tender meat?"
I said, this is yours, Russian!
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
Five minutes walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hangs a stop-leaf, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchins.
Chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Most" and the bar "Arrow" Director Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, and the Director becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Color cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why is it worth so much?"
They say, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, do you know how much their shell weighs?
For the price, it turns out that it is a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: "The first three months were fine, then the quality dropped sharply."
The main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants do not know what will happen to them when the supply of cheese runs out.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of separate economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is mainly called food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants started cheharda with suppliers: prices for products have increased, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
This will affect the most expensive restaurants with a single kitchen in France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from the "home" countries.
The general drink had to be rebuilt before.
For example, when in early 2014, Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up beef supplies from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions of the summer of 2014 turned out to be much more serious.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for sowing.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes that the sanctions could be eased further.
So far, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Dear restaurants will have to change the menu for what local farmers and other countries produce,” says Sergey Mironov, a restaurateur, owner of the Restconsult agency.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and the development of a new menu can take two or three months.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to refuse from 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine already begin to replace dishes, for example, steak from marble beef - befstroganov, says Sergey Mironov.
"Cheese from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," Oksana Glebchuk, a representative of the East-West company, said.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway - salmon, salmon, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to rearrange than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who are able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project establishments, he believes.
Ginza Project has dozens of restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace it,” Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the lack of owners in the country.
The owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more fragrant than European ones.
But there are also a lot of restaurants that the sanctions will hardly affect.
These include establishments with cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
"There are no expensive products in Georgian cuisine," says Hatuna Kolbaya, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the cafe "Vai Mae!".
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use.
In the establishments Kolbai has not removed from the menu any dishes.
Timur Lansky, the owner of restaurants "Caihon N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also do not embarrass: he will have to change only lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia establishes imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, - he says.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what is brought from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish like that.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olimboy Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetable products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
The fast food restaurants that responded to the “Money” request also reacted quite calmly to the sanctions.
The McDonald’s press service said the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, Head of Subway Russia’s Supplier Department, about 80% of the products are purchased by the network in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In "Teremka" "sanctions products" did not occupy more than 4%.
Sanctions and nutmeg "Wocker" were not affected.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potatoes did not respond to the Money request, but other market participants argue that Burger King’s localization is significantly less than McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurateurs are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern
On his hump
At the same time, restaurants complain that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"For products for Grabley, prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice," - says the restaurateur Roman Rozhnikovskiy.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
East-West does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazil’s suppliers have almost doubled pork prices,” said Sergei Rak, deputy CEO of Stardogs.
The price of chickens increased by 35%.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, - says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of general catering revenue for the second quarter of 2014 is only 1.8%.
This is the lowest level since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how fast: while most restaurateurs have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the fluctuations in purchase prices.
But what will happen in two months, no one knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the middle of the stage, the musicians play the waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with a funny name "There is time to eat".
"We were going to celebrate local food for a long time, and here we just sanctioned, we rushed, organized a festival," says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with musicians, Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on the preparation of borsch with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In the tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salekhard, vegetables from the suburban "Lenin Sovkhoz", cheeses from the devastated Italian Jay Close.
“The salmon for restaurants can be safely replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop “Svoi menschi”.
We've got a kidney, a kita, a kitsch, a humpback, a chuchycha - "royal salmon".
Yes, they are not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your arms, he doesn't even move.
And you can't hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only establishments without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic one
In the window of his tent there are shrimp with the tag "Magadan", cod, omul, muxun, mussels from the Crimea, rakes from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Imports of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop “Svoi hodiny” has been operating since 2012, sells fish through an online store, and before the imposition of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, “Simple things”.
Now Galkin received applications from another 15 restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - he is hot.
We got tired and tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles per month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
In confirmation, I'm being served a portion of Philadelphia with a keta in Galkin's tent.
Unlike rolls with salmon, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls of paltus and sea bass.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," - explains the owner of the Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the vacant niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the project LavkaLavka Boris Akimov, now we can talk more about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace the prohibited imports, unlike our farmers.
That is, the ban will benefit first of all the major producers of other countries," Akimov says.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
As a result of mass unscheduled inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activity of three McDonald’s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg was temporarily suspended.
“We are studying the nature of the claims to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
No one really knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on the condition of anonymity an employee of a company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s were shut down across the country, the scenario would be different.
"Europrotocol" instead of traffic police
Casco payments can be received without a traffic police certificate - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction of the "Euro-protocol" in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of guidelines, according to which from September 1 this year to receive payments under the casco insured motorist will be able to do without a traffic police certificate.
This is true only in cases where the accident was registered under the “Europrotocol” without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit, and both drivers have reached an agreement on who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often, even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be registered under the "Europrotocol", drivers who have been in an accident cause DPS.
After all, in the presence of a policy kasco to get a refund on it without a certificate of traffic police was not possible.
The parameters spelled out in the draft guidelines are precisely designed to eliminate this obstacle to the introduction of the "Euro-protocol" in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment under the casco in connection with an accident, executed without traffic police officers, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it can not be higher than the limit set in the insurance contract of the casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both DPS employees and roads.
But, most likely, it will not be pleased either motorists or insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat of the growth of fraud, which can lead to the introduction of new rules for payments on the casco.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the primordial Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is still unknown what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Euro-protocol".
Savings certificate will be made nameless and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of the irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will ban savings certificates on the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates for the bearer do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper for the bank, since there is no need to make a deduction to the fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).
The piquancy of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken due to small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and it will affect Sberbank and the Bank of Moscow, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that customers of a small bank who bought such a certificate, in case of revocation of his license, are trying to get money from the ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified absence of insurance payments under these certificates in case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tensions.
In the practice of the agency, there were cases when holders of bearer certificates tried to recover insurance compensation through the court," the ASV said.
The problem, of course, is contrived.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, because they do not have the right to reimbursement from the state by law.
If it were that the instrument was not insured in the ADR, it would also prohibit metal accounts on which citizens' funds are counted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, however, their existence is not yet threatened by anyone.
The fact is, most likely, that bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which can actually act as a quasi-dene.
At the same time, their movement is almost uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before cashing out such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no coincidence that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must necessarily be a name security, which must be kept in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable contribution, which bankers have long dreamed of, is introduced.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests were held by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what has been described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairklau followed the events for us over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter Islamic State militants, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 charges to them, as well as 8,000 assault rifles G3 and G36.
The deliveries will be completed by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Merkel will make a government statement in the Bundestag on the subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to the “hot spots”.
The opinion of the people of Germany about sending weapons to the Iraqis was divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop ISIS fighters, while others fear that these weapons may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants hit Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias shot down a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31.
According to available data, this happened in Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoe (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is specified that the incident occurred today about 16:20 MSK.
The teenagers were taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains.
Two Bushwalker teenagers were taken by helicopter to safety after spending the night stranded in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man went hiking shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, which included local police and a rescue team, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Vale Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and injured his head.
The officers stayed with the couple overnight and were picked up on a winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in a stable ambulance to Blue Mountains Hospital.
There were two alliances
The summit talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of the Eurasian Union.
Although on a troubling occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of “hot problems”.
Whether such a structure is able to work effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions about this fell off on the evening of August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko in the telenovelas.
The Belarusian leader was an example of refined courtesy, it was the behavior of a man who had just torn the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimation of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Denis Melyantsov, a senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies, is confident that from now on, Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will be defrosted further,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the Belarusian authorities began preparing for the breakthrough long before the November Maidan in Kiev in the summer of 2013.
"The results were achieved and with the EU - these are successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization, - the interlocutor of the "Hogonka" - and negotiations on international security were held with the United States.
The U.S. has even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only overwhelmed this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk has not left the Customs Union or the CSTO, and a Russian air base is located in Baranovichi.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk’s balanced position on the Ukrainian issue – and appreciated it, Belarusian experts are sure.
How successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be, it will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to host meetings in the format of the EU+TC.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton was not able to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Ashton spokeswoman Maja Kosjancic only told Ogonku that the issue was not a priority given the resolution of war and peace issues.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan could become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
A drop of tar for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked about it by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all parties do not mind that Minsk remains the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia--OSCE--Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is gaining the status of a fully handshaked European leader who helps to solve the global problem.
Best Friend of the Farmer
The composition of the EU delegation, which included EU Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion that the main backdrop of the summit was not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the concerns of the CU countries under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU seems to be an achievement of a larger scale than the peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Commissioner for Trade Karl De Gucht, however, said: "EU representatives have come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around."
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences – and above all the reciprocal sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which so far is experiencing sanctions pressure, a long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to the head of the Mises Research Center, the former presidential candidate of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin rushed to Minsk at the summit.
"The initiators of these schemes," Romanchuk said, "are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, - the expert continues, - is due to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not mind to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion dollars of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and CU negotiating platform is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of developing economic ties with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agrarian sector from Moscow’s sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered farmers only 125 million euros of compensation.
The Belarusian president may offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for Eurofarmers.
This could lift Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the format of the TC + EU is denied, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any intrusion to discuss, not from the bay-barakhta to make a decision, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was developing at that time in Ukraine," he said.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian diplomatic department diligently emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing interaction between the EU and CU on its land, does not pursue self-interest, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create a single economic space in the future from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, are put forward and promoted by the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation," the Belarusian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entry
The government of Moscow is considering the introduction of zones with paid entry as a method of combating the congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One of the options that has successfully proven itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, we will look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this matter," Liksutov said.
The mayor stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which are similar in structure and workload to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of a central ring road, Liksutov added.
The recently started construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there was enough bypass infrastructure, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow,” the deputy mayor said.
Maxim Liksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking significantly unloaded the streets of the capital.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital, Sergei Sobyanin, took part in the ceremony of laying the foundation for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (TSKAD).
The boredom of sin.
Frank Miller and Robert Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez’s “City of Sins 2: A Woman Worth Killing For” revolutionized the world.
The first “City of Sins” (2005), filmed with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also in its own way revolutionary: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we understand the thesis by the universe of noara, and by the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should be read: "theses - antithesis - chaos".
The “City of Sins-2” is chaotic both on the dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar from the first "City", although, here, the thunderous Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, and only manages to pull out - in the role of such a popular soldier - knives and other axes with rods.
But the old people are literally pushed with their elbows by newcomers, as if they broke into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, his story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is from the lusty-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something Dwight (Josh Brolin) is avenging her.
But this confusion, in which Dwight, let's say, can't be distinguished from Johnny in person - especially since faces, like other parts of the body, are endured by the characters with inexorable regularity - is not a trouble or even half a trouble.
These are not people, we understand that these are archetypes of the noir: a fatal bitch, too confident a player, caught in the "honey trap" of sex detective, a corrupt ghost-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, then this is no longer a movie, but read that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is simply ridiculous.
Besides, even in this troubled world there is something permanent.
Fighting whores from the first "City" still hold a circular defense against the besieging slums of the forces of darkness.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan no-no, and look at the light, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the “City of Sins-2” is another.
Frank Miller was good in that as a painter he talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director - he turned the idea of how to transfer comics to the screen.
Comics and noir are two aggressively opposite "reality."
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "The Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "The Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of noir, then called hard-boiled school - "cool school".
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the sailor Popay - the eater of spinach, giving him heroic power, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "Avengers".
But in any movie based on comics, there was something flawed: the painted characters stubbornly did not want to overgrow the screen flesh, they remained pretenders in the "real" world around them.
Simply put, they were utterly devoid of “existence.”
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
What Forsyths, what Thebeau and Rugon Maccars, what Bolkons and Rostovs at all are conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammett on his skin learned what it is to work as a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
As, by the way, there were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as the writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Lowey, Edward Dmitrik.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they set, firstly, is crude and cynical, and secondly - purely social.
This is hardly the American version of socialism.
The first “City of Sins” was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally, but organically connected the comic book with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the corrupt world, where the cardinal ordered murders, and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And picturesque details such as the cut heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Elroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseating - representative of the neonoires.
"City of Sins 2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of the radical stylistics of Miller-Rodriguez to the comic book tradition.
This is due in large part to 3D technology.
When you watch the second “City of Sins”, you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow falls asleep a toy cloak.
However, most often it is not snow, but bloody scrapes, but by and large what is the difference?
There is nothing to say about sociality.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return a girl who went down a crooked path or, say, tell inconsolable parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place for sin in the city except for sin, sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It's as boring as any norm.
The "City of Sins 2" chaos is just boring.
For the sake of justice, domestic rent gave this fresh sin a small, but pepper.
The subtitles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person breaks his fingers with a pinch, this gives a hell of a humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
French Socialists Must Shut Up and Bring France in Order, Says Key Ally Frasois Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left to “demonstrate warmth” to the attacked socialist president, whose permutations did not find approval from the vast majority of French.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay close to him,” he said, arousing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite conflict-inspiring proposals, it should loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain “united” with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of justice, put sticks in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “lose faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pee, leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for the constant internal conflicts among the Socialists, saying she had no idea the new Wall government would last longer than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Valle, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last a summer.
"And the new one won't last autumn or winter either," Ms Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to govern.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right Front National came first in the EU elections in May.
A poll by Sunday’s Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks breaking up into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Syance Poe University, warned that the French will quickly lose patience if the new socialist government fails to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get even worse.
"City without drugs" was left without a claim
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court left without consideration the claim of the managing directorate of the regional Ministry for the management of state property to the Fund "City without drugs".
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
The plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the executive directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the Fund "City without Drugs" (one of the founders is Yevgeny Roizman, Mayor of Yekaterinburg).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles as a fee for the lease of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, which is why it was decided to refuse to consider.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the MUGISO Directorate could not explain, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
There was also no contact with the Fund.
We will remind, we are talking about the mansion, which occupied the fund in the city center on Belinsky street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the managing directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the agency demanded through the court to recognize the contract of free use of the mansion-monument.
According to the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not include significant conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk arbitration court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Perm arbitration court, which was granted.
Then, in the same court, the Foundation filed an appeal against this decision, which was left unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the Foundation to the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the Directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was signed, under which the fund again began to pay rent, the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman said.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free use, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently,” he said.
Tatyana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was asked to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the city council of Yekaterinburg united Russia Alexander Kosintsev proposed to the mayor of the city - the speaker of the city council Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of murder of a pensioner of the Deputy of the City Duma Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor.
How Eugene Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of Yekaterinburg Mayor Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported in the State Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova addressed with the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in her blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that “this is another attempt to avenge the truth.”
iPhone Turned into a Wallet
On the eve of 9 September, when Apple is due to present its new developments, the press appears more and more leaks about what can be expected from the presentation.
According to sources, the sixth generation of the iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint project of Apple and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user on his/her fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will be for the first time built-in technology NFC (near field communication), which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reader at the checkout.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
NFC was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that are part of the so-called NFC Forum, an association to promote the technology.
The first NFC phone was launched by Nokia in 2006.
The first NFC-enabled Android smartphone, the Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay with a smartphone on Android.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still make retailers accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their outlets.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris’ position on Mistral deliveries to Russia does not change
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Romain Nadal said Paris' position on the delivery of Mistral-class helicopter carriers to Russia remains unchanged.
“I can recall the statement of the President of the Republic (Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande), made by him in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today the level of sanctions does not prevent the delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not France," Nadal told RIA Novosti.
Thus, the representative of the French Foreign Ministry answered the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract.

Norwegian Cruise closes $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise operator, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion, according to people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, with access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The deal could be announced as early as this week, sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the negotiations are not open.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while a representative of Apollo declined to comment on the information.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, 13 percent more than in 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that sail to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
She reported income of $1.2 billion in 2013, 6% higher than the year before.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to benefit in the coming years from the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The competition companies seek to position themselves as the cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for initial public offering in January 2014.
Apollo became the company’s main shareholder after a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists now, in 2000, as a result of a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a conglomerate of entertainment and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thei.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to reports.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents at the first public offering of Prestige Cruises.
The TV and radio company "Crimea" can receive 250 million rubles of subsidies
The Ministry of Communications of Russia proposes to allocate 250 million rubles to the state television and radio company "Crimea" in 2014.
According to the draft resolution of the Ministry of Communications, posted on a single portal of disclosure of information on the preparation of regulatory acts, the subsidies are planned to be spent "to cover the costs of creating conditions for large-scale information coverage of the socio-economic situation and the development of modern information space on the territory of the Republic of Crimea."
The money will also go to buy equipment, repair the roof and power supply systems in the building of the television and radio company, founded in 1959, RIA Novosti reported.
Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Suspend Chinese Representative's Speech One Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday set out a procedure under which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the election of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first get the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot box and has forced activists of the democratic movement to once again promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center with the Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication by Beijing of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong, in June, activists of the democratic movement held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and staged a sit-in strike.
The briefing is organized by the Government of Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Hong Kong and Macau State Council, Feng Wei, also had to deliver a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather outside the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
The United Kingdom did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is due to the desire to repay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
Israel’s Defense Ministry said on Sunday it was taking over the territory and instructed the military to establish administrative control over the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza Strip Saib Arikata, the world public should hold Israel accountable for “continuing settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin urges Kiev to start talks on “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the seceding region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean to imply that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine must be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
But Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start talks with pro-Russian rebels as equals was consistent with the obvious strategy he has pursued since the start of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly-proclaimed territory of Novorossia de facto independence in order to get closer to Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with the state-run First Television Channel, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military campaign to regain separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently called the occupied territories Novorossia, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said anyone who believes peace talks will take place in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and as government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a “prisoner of illusions.”
“We must immediately begin meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of broader autonomy that had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to appease fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights were in jeopardy.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s words underscored the Russian leadership’s decision to behave toward the separatist uprising in the east in a way other than openly seizing Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much heavier battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians, and polls before the conflict showed widespread support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would connect Russia’s main territory to Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, houses the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inaugural speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh the amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed new insurgent offensives last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory right up to Crimea.
This led to large-scale civil and military efforts to fortify Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko appealed to a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels on Saturday to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that had been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of tougher sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airborne fighters captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal captures Australian celebrities and Gaby Greco
Jeffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust for hackers who may have stolen nude photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos of nude Jennifer Lawrence hit the Internet as a result of a massive hacking scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of the "Hunger Games" Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singer Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strachowski and Melbourne-based Greco also reportedly had photos stolen as a result of an iCloud leak.
In the list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco an offer last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those targeted “feel they’ve been invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots of her lying at the pool with her breasts exposed.
Palmer's work in film includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chuck" Strachowski and the actress from "Forbidden Admission" Browning did not comment on the stolen photos yesterday.
A spokesman for Lawrence told TMZ: “This is a brazen invasion of privacy.”
The actor Seth Rogen expressed his indignation at the hacker, writing on Twitter: "Putting photos stolen from a mobile phone is really no different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, you can't tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal nude celebrity photos has been discovered
The massive hacking of star accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario of events described the resource The Next Web.
Github published a script in the language of Python, which allowed you to select passwords for the service Find My Phone Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same combination of login and password of Apple ID is used, as for access to the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the search method to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of combinations of characters are consecutively entered, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered in the Find My Phone service is unlimited.
If the security system is properly organized, after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user of the attempted hacking.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about an attempt to retrieve a password to their account.
Hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a hackapp user on Twitter, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password-selecting scripting program was written to it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted Hackapp and noted that the above vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that there is no evidence that such a vulnerability was used to access the account "stars".
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister again appeared foreign records
While there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has already been a wave of malicious activity using the service.
Hackers intercepted the control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, the security of the cloud was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations about how users lost their accounts.

Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian five-man team
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buriak.
The relevant decree was published on the Internet portal of legal information.
Earlier this year, the athlete moved to Russia for permanent residence and appealed to the Federation of modern pentathlon with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in the personal championship and became the world champion in the mixed relay, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It also maintains a leading position in the current season.
According to the rules, in order to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to get a special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buriak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to the chess player Ekaterina Lagno, a native of Lviv, who is a two-time champion of Europe (2005, 2008), the world in flash (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women's team of Ukraine, the athlete became the winner of the chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the team world championship in Astana (2013) and the team European Championship in Warsaw (2013).
<0xD0><0xA0><0xD0><0x9A><0xD0><0xA0> stopped the investigation of the accident Tu-204 in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICR) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the Tu-204 aircraft of the airline Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and flight engineer.
The forensics showed that the cause of the disaster was the increased speed of landing, the failure of the crew to perform standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintentional output of engines to increased direct thrust speeds.
The Tu-204 aircraft of Red Wings, which followed the flight from Prague to Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 while landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft rolled out of the runway and caught fire.
At the scene of the accident, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to medical facilities, where they subsequently died of their injuries.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with severe bodily injuries, underwent long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the accident on the Kiev highway, suffered serious injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the crash, the traffic prosecutor’s office conducted an inspection at Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the license of the airline was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger is the most universal and functional human emotion.
An angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists in Australia and the United States found.
They reported their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be read in a press release of the University of California at Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face is shifted and lowered eyebrows, stretched in a thin line of lips, bloated nostrils - the same in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children who have never seen it, says the lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, scientists have found that this emotion arose for the effective conduct of disputes during conflict.
The more physical damage one person can cause to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he reports it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers also found confirmation of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to be angry and go on hand-to-hand, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavorable conditions on others, and prefer forceful methods of resolving conflicts to peaceful ones.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily an "emotion of bargaining", the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create an angry facial expression should make the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor - and thus force as soon as possible to agree to his conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers simulated on a computer faces where each of the seven elements of the angry face were present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although lowered eyebrows or a forwarded chin separately did not make the face evil, the physically stronger person was recognized by the study participants unanimously.
Human anger, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to accept and obey.
A person inflates his nostrils and squeezes his lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or a baboon that shows off its fangs.
“Anger is triggered by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes a form that most effectively demonstrates to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tuby.
