Welsh assembly members fear they will “look like Muppets”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are outraged by the proposal that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of assemblies across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One Labour Party member said his group feared it "rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member for Plaid said the group as a whole was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh conservative said his group was approaching a name change "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP is close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter “w” is pronounced similarly to the letter “u” in Yorkshire English.
The assembly’s commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on how the members of the Welsh assembly will be called will, of course, be made by the members themselves.”
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, where broad support was given to the option of calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of members of the assembly, the committee preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant received the greatest support in public debate.
Members of the assembly are clearly proposing alternative options, but the fight for consensus may bring concern to President Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft of legislation within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and a draft committee system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the issue of their title as part of the discussion of the new legislation.
Macedonians to vote on changing country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The nationwide vote is set to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested against the country's EU and NATO membership applications.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, said he would not follow the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply the price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silent as churches in Harlem fight to survive
“The old people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
"There's nothing there today."
The disappearance of the bar is understandable.
"People meet in a different way today," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their officials expect, "and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started."
As he adds, churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of this type of people who will not help the remaining tabernacles in the neighborhood much.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by the Black Congregation, whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping boulevard, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a bell tower.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bells "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the bell in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell game in a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says he was never replaced at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, the complicated story of architects and builders took place at St. Martin, some of whom were called by lay representatives of the church, others by episcopal dioceses.
In July, the Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese expressing concern that the diocese would “try to assign costs” to the council of elders, even though they had not taken part in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Diving for Lobster in California
According to the official report, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the day of the start of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and then paddled with the whole group to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the call was a joy to catch a lobster at first, but then “he realized he was shouting ‘He bit me!
He bit me!’”
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that "he had torn the entire area of the collarbone."
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles, a mercenary at a press conference, said the shark had been spotted in the area for weeks, but it was determined it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
For investigation and security reasons, authorities have closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to stand up to the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams through department store-style beauty lanes where specialized saleswomen will be available.
As part of a strong <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn expansion into the UK cosmetics market, while fashion and household goods sales are declining, the avenues will be tested at 11 stores across the country, and will expand to other stores next year if successful.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to supermarkets’ efforts to find use for racks previously used for televisions, microwaves and household supplies.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the size of its cosmetics portfolio to 3,000 products and will introduce brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also be able to offer more space thanks to brands similar to Boots.
The supermarket is also re-introducing its Boutique make-up range, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will test the concessions of Fragrance Shop, a perfume retailer. The first such store opened last week in Croydon, South London, and another one this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the internet and moving towards daily shopping for small amounts of food in local stores means supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury’s has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat divisions, which are the chains it bought two years ago, which have increased food sales and made acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to remodel the department with cosmetics and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested a joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from drug sales in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds plans to add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands to the four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We’ve changed the look and style of our aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to consult.
Our range of brands should cater to all needs and an enticing environment and convenient location mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are changing old ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones is “outraged” after Holly Willoughby pulled out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew her $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
The business of this couple was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old programmer announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to informed sources, Jones was “outraged” when a TV star, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to the new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could double Willoughby's fortune at an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones left the UK for one of his summer residences.
An unnamed source said: “The Truly brand was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her for several decades to come.
Her decision to leave was shocking to everyone involved.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
There's a full warehouse of ready-to-sell goods at the Marlow headquarters."
Experts believe the departure of show host This Morning, one of Britain’s most lucrative stars, could cost the company millions due to a massive investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home clothes and possible further delays in the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the Truly brand with Tara Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become M&S’s ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin in moderating I’m A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult action "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he gets from journalists for a remark that some consider “unworthy of the president” and for how positively he speaks about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with a mocking “voicing” voice.
"I didn't give up."
He noted that after Trump praised their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards denuclearizing North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, prominent North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see an "appropriate response" from the US to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results — ending missile tests, helping to free hostages, and returning the remains of U.S. troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was driven out of their homes, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit demanding," Sumbung said.
Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff can work here.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paula to see if international organizations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of Mother Nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh against the tsunami, it is not common on other parts of the coast.
The apparent lack of sirens warning of a tsunami in Paula may have contributed to the loss of human lives, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best time, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paula, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was a major focus of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is plagued by funding outages.
President Yoko is also facing pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, with members of the Muslim majority adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and drove tens of thousands of people out of their homes.
Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a passport from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters outside the Chelsea gate when his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball to the left and shot to a distant stick.
The arrow flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped the jumping Kep Arrizabalag and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far ahead as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching me, so I didn't think about it much, and I shot at one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-finals after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent his passport back to Mate Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the pitch and sprinted halfway across Liverpool.
Kovacic hit the ball quickly.
Then he sent the ball down a beautiful alley to Hazard in lime.
He ran away from the defense and left the bar to a distant pole next to Alisson Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will face the local team in the Champions League group at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 3 p.m. in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami surged to 832.
A 7.5-magnitude quake struck on Friday, triggering waves as high as 6 meters and imprisoning many people in the wreckage of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugro's spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Paulu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was dotted with ruins of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and the police immediately opened an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on the Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people in the area who have seen or heard something to report.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to appeal to all those who have been moving near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras may have recorded something, to contact us because they may have important information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman was living in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
Friends who think they know the woman arrived at the scene this afternoon to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said an investigation was underway and are now informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
A police officer told one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
He keeps saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape and another was waiting outside.
In the closed area, there are many police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101, or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter the code 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become a hit recently over a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a well-deserved punishment for his fanatical, Taliban-style Puritan followers destroying many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the targets.
Cromwell did not order or enforce iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the 19th century view and part of the character’s historiography, which many believe still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although today a little less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, by the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure that represents one side of this division.
His success as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and commemorating.”
Killer Pig Teases Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeast China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname “Yuan” was found dead with a severed artery in a pool of blood near a barn at a market in Liou-phan-shui, Kuejzhou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to administer the vaccine to pigs in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in the city of Si-ning in the Chinese province of Qinghai.
On Wednesday, he arrived with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next barn was open.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with a bloody mouth.
According to the information, the forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig tore the farmer.
"The cousin's legs were all bloody and torn," Guiyang Evening News quoted the cousin as saying by his last name, "Wu."
Security camera footage shows Yuan coming to the market at 4.40 on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been closed so that no one else would think of it when police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Swine attacks on humans are rare, but they have already occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and drove it away until the farmer's wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa Remains Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
In the coming days, however, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. eastern time, Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure furrow is forming over the Pacific Ocean and moving eastward to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical humidity, with the approaching low-pressure furrow, will cause heavy rains in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Precipitation of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous flooding, debris streams and possible landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwestern United States, especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
In rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain, flooding can occur.
Given the danger of tropical rainfall, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms bring locally impacting winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure furrow will bring strong local rainfall on parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation above 13 mm may occur, which could cause smaller debris streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, rare tropical showers begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, the rain will spread.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of a significant temperature difference is the U.S. center on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will again try to spread the summer heat.
In most areas in the middle and east of the U.S., a warm beginning of October is expected, with temperatures of about 27 °C from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern U.S.
In New York City, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the US in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation has been watched by more than 20 million people.
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s engaging testimony on six television channels from Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault allegedly in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and broadcasters interrupted routine programs with reports of a sudden Friday turnaround: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the charges.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure Kavanaugh was groping her at a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.
Kavanaugh said in an excited statement that he was 100 percent sure it hadn’t happened.
It is likely that the event was followed by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company calculated average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast the testimonies, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who are looking at offices.
For comparison, it is a similar number of spectators who watch football matches in the play-offs or Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest ratings of all stations, with an average of 5.69 million viewers watching it during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
The second station was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the negotiations were concluded.
The main character in Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning caught protesters yelling at him as he was about to take the elevator to a court hearing.
CNN broadcast live as he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and let himself be cursed.
A woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He also heard, “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before closing the elevator door, he added that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and television networks later aired live when a panel of judges was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI by next week, as demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded by interviews with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made up his mind.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “politicians” on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of being “politicians” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, which was close to the prime minister’s front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan when he said the proposal that Britain and the EU should levy tariffs on each other was “completely meaningless.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police say Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to the WABF channel, which belongs to CBS, police secured the glasses at the crime scene and found Simpson's DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson confessed that he shot Waydeo.
According to the lawyer, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner’s office released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for their “duty and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The two-meter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death "shake" and "shocked" him.
"This is what you're always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes at Mexico City
The ashes from the volcano Popacatépetl hit the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano after the volcano’s activity increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center watched a series of rumblings and shocks.
Images of the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, appeared on social media.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a magnitude of 7.1.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
On the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after independence protesters clashed with law enforcement and thousands of people took part in competitive demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Police officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists.
Later, clashes broke out, for which the police had to use batons to calm down.
Within hours, independence groups sang “We will not forget, we will not forgive” in the face of protesting supporters of the union who shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal but is celebrated by separatist Catalans, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, but the turnout was low as opponents of the secession boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to end voting in polling stations in violent clashes across the region.
Independence groups stayed outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Eighty-six-year-old electrician Narcis Termes, who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote, but now we are in a dead end,” he said.
Despite an important, though close, victory in last December's regional elections, Catalan independence parties had to fight to keep things going this year, with many of their best-known leaders either going into exile themselves or awaiting trial for their involvement in organising a referendum and subsequently declaring independence.
Forty-two-year-old fitter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone and said the conflict had been stirred up by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial in prison since late last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Man incarcerated after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gate and the house were damaged.
At one point, someone may have shot the car from the crossbow.
Meng's win secured Livingston a 1-0 victory over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who stepped down from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and awarded Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team does not yet have a win in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday they will face the first Hearts, which loses eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extended the series of undefeated matches in the division to six matches, so that head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, had not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston did not take advantage of the opportunity against the inconspicuous guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped just past Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
The hosts had only to watch the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could trouble guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
A free kick was ordered against the Rangers, and Livingston formed a knot, Declan Gallagher and Robinson sent together Menga, who scored and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but home defense for them was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly usually did not have much to do.
The same image of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed out on another standard situation at Livingston.
The penalty area of Livingston was constantly flown by the centers, which the players kept cleaning up, and two penalty kicks came to nothing – after Halkett’s attack on Deputy Glenn Middleton and another by the hand.
“The Phenomenon” from Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were without exception excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
Their style of play and team have hardly changed since returning to the top, but Holt deserves a lot of praise for the way the team has rallied since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-arranged defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they don't meet those standards anymore.
Their ending was weak — they only penetrated the home side once — and for the Rangers it should be an alarm clock because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone smiled.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed over a number of topics including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
This city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque, but many supporters appeared in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people – many of them Kurds – were also heard protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The counter-protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, whom some German Turks hailed as a hero, and others cursed as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
A cyclist died in London after colliding with a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street with the busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday’s tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver left the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in riots in a high-security men's prison.
Riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time and are still ongoing.
Specialized guards from the Tornado team were called in to handle the riots involving eight prisoners in one wing.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison service said: “Specially trained prison workers have been deployed to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police and may spend more time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 inmates in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous delinquents in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison ended after the attack of the prisoner in the hospital.
And last October, law enforcement units were called to the prison because of serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (area where drought can benefit)
It’s not common for a low-pressure tropical furrow to hit Arizona, but that’s what’s likely to happen early next week when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa overcomes the desert southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities like Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or lower pressure within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict precipitation of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona in places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates of up to 100 mm.
For those who are not threatened by tidal floods, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, because the area was hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it may help somewhere, because the southwestern United States has just hit a drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing “extreme drought,” the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa’s journey will lead to Baja California, Mexico.
Rosa, still a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, will then be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico on Sunday morning and will be moving at a speed of 19 km/h north.
Then the storm meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be strong, posing a high risk of flooding.
"In the area from Baja California to northwest Sonor, total precipitation of 75 to 150 mm is expected, and up to 250 mm may occur," according to weather.com.
Rosa then sails like a tropical storm across Mexico to the north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then passes through Arizona and enters southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The main risk to Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwestern United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly flooding and debris streams in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now “stable”.
According to police from Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who may have a record of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh ‘experienced the wickedness and anger’ of Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “experienced the wickedness and anger” of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, “the Americans were witnessing Kavanaugh’s greatness and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia that "Judge Kavanaugh's affirmative vote is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal brains of our time, a lawyer who has excellent public service on his account."
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans participating in midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
"I'm not running, but I'm still on the move," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
An adviser to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami kill hundreds of people and death toll continues to rise
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people lost their lives, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded beaches.
Hundreds of people gathered on the beach in the town of Palu on Friday, but at twilight the coast was hit by waves of up to six meters, which killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people continued to operate on the beaches and did not immediately escape, so they fell to the waves as a victim," Sutopo Purwo Nugro, spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB Disaster Mitigation Agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave didn't go by itself, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami wave spread at 800 km/h.
He said that some people escaped from the wave to the trees and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday as well.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful quakes was about 200 times more powerful than the force of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, which could further increase the tsunami wave.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found jammed under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho reported that the number of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is close to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was "completely paralyzed without any information" from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for failing to report that Palu was hit by a tsunami wave, although authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In amateur footage shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is heard screaming desperately to warn people on the street of the impending tsunami.
Within a few minutes, the coastline will be hit by a water wall that carries buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the report immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The airport in the city was reopened only for transportation assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When World Vision workers from Donggala arrived in the city of Paulu, where employees were hiding in shelters made of cells built in the courtyard of an office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba says.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When the relief groups began their sad disaster relief activities, some complained that foreign workers with extensive experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can begin to flow to the site of the calamity only when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Indonesian Red Cross spokesman Aulia Arriani.
“Once the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, the friends and relatives of those still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the grim stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been involved in paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr Gendon described how in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned of the Roa Roa hotel collapse, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue checkmarks, his messages ended with a gray mark.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he says.
The thieves took $26,750 during the replenishment of the ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning while refilling an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money into it.
In doing so, another man “runs out from behind a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money to be put into an ATM.
According to a press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
For any information on the identity of suspects, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
The change was announced on Twitter on Saturday, where he wrote: "A House formally known as Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is due to release his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "feeling reasons", according to the creator of the show.
West has previously said that the word for him, in addition to shortening the existing professional name, also has a religious meaning.
“In my opinion, ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when he spoke to radio host Big Boy about his album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
Many other famous rappers have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love (love) and Brother Love (brotherly love).
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z, also wrote his name alternately with and without a conjunctiva and in capitals and small letters.
Mexican president vows not to use military against civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when left-wing student movements were spreading across Latin America, soldiers began shooting people at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those studying and opening other free public universities.
Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. Should Double Funding for Artificial Intelligence
According to investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and the US should double the amount they spend on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government have released announcements on AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal AI strategy.
China, meanwhile, introduced a plan last year to become a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are much further away than the U.S. and we’re looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in Othello, and later served as Microsoft’s research executive and president of Google’s Chinese subsidiary.
Lee praised the U.S. government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robot Challenge, and asked when the next one would be to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government grants.
“Academic leaders are not led by China, but by corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to improve its AI efforts.
“In my opinion, the green cards should be automatically offered to holders of a doctorate in the field of AI,” he says.
The State Council of China has published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the new generation in July 2017.
China’s National Foundation of Natural Sciences provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the U.S., but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
The U.S. Department of Defense has set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center this year to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House has announced the creation of an AI Selection Commission.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, the US legislation, which wanted to create a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence, has not done anything for many months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonians on Sunday voted in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
Both governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents objected that the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of voters will show up to make the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum was: “Are you in favor of membership in NATO and the EU with the adoption of an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16 percent, up from 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters ultimately cast their votes.
“I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum on a name change that would pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents erected by people boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not the doors for the service," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us like Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
The “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum – less than the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
Failure to hold a referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since its inception last May.
Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero scored a goal through Brighton’s defense.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling finished the defence of Brighton on Saturday, securing Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguero's performance, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentinian attacker got in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and entered the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he circumvented one defender and overtook several others.
He found Sterling with the next pass to the left.
The English striker knocked the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hand shot.
"Aguero has problems with his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match, however, was arranged by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton territory.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant pole.
The Sky Blues attacker put the ball in the net just before it slipped off the pitch.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the joy of Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to re-enter.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have the hope of a play-off.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still want to win their first division title.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, we can at least throw it away because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the other team will play probably with the greatest effort I’ll experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play in it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
It would be Scherzer's 34th start, he'd be training and pitching on a Sunday when he's usually off.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has a statistic of 18-7 this season with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump speaks at a meeting in West Virginia
The president spoke indirectly about the situation surrounding his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republicans attending midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done will be at stake.
We have five weeks to make one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take over power by whatever means are needed, you see the wickedness, the disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to roll over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats have opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he added, adding that Democrats are “angry and evil and disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Commission, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud roar of the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring the document?
Uh, what?
No, um, no, wait -- that was really bad body language -- worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse political party.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists from Momento in my local party voted in favour of my admonition, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome – because they have sincerely expressed their opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she was resolutely anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was criticized in my admonition for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday’s Labour Party meeting in Nottingham East said that “we want the meetings to be accessible and productive.”
Most of the eight years that I have been a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, most meetings do not take place today, and the promise of a “kinder, more gracious” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever started.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged whether it is acceptable for the party’s leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues, who I thought we had similar political views, suddenly expected me to turn 180° and hold positions that I otherwise could not agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tirade of insults on social media, where they call for my appeal, condemn the policy of the center and tell me that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that are aimed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a wave of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never give up.
One aspect of this era of politics that I am most disappointed with is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer that diverse stream of opinion, and with each proposal to express distrust or change the rules of choice, the party becomes more limited.
In the last two years, I have been advised many times to stay back, not to talk so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the negligence of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which literally let my general school class fall apart, I have struggled to fight for better public services for those most in need – whether as a local councilor or as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be surprised by my political positions and areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who backed the proposal on Friday, I would only say that when the country is penetrating towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not to the Moment in Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of revocation or political pragmatism will deter me from acting on what I believe is the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: The undefeated Ayr rises to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Now they are at the head of the table as the only undefeated.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of opportunities, which helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot of trials in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "Honor Ayra, they've taken a better chance than we have."
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's five, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot won the unchanged five.
Climo raised Ayr's lead with a penalty and then scored exactly in the half and turned the solo attempt, so he adjusted it to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's five, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
Then there was a longer delay due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher, and when the game began again, Ayr again jumped thanks to Stafford McDowall's five, which he transformed into Climo.
Ayru's deputy captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of the player again, thanks to Bruce Colvin's unchanged five after a brief heavy push.
The hosts returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was given yellow for attacking Clim without the ball, MacPherson placed the ball behind the advancing Maul Ayru from the penalty line.
Climo turned, again almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the top five.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
It seems that the star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is moving into the hospitality industry. It was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and in which he co-stars with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to an extract from the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source for the Scottish Sun newspaper suggested that Kiernan wanted to engage in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
'The sea is ours': Inland Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to Pacific Ocean
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings is a blue flag in the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described with the slogan: “The sea is rightfully ours.
It is our duty to get it.”
Throughout inland Bolivia, there is still a vivid memory of the coastline that the country lost to Chile in the bloody war over resources in the 19th century – as well as a desire to revisit the Pacific Ocean.
These aspirations are perhaps the biggest in several decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the International Court of Justice, which is due to fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the MSD’s decision on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after many decades of intermittent talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous President Evo Morales – who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year – is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, much would not change.
The Dutch-based UN body has no authority to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it would not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “was not complicated,” according to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the past four years, not only have they not supported the Bolivian cause, but perhaps they have rather slowed it down.
“The question of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian government,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all of Chile’s remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will once again begin negotiations, but after this it will be extremely difficult to have discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – would use the sea issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“A judgment is an opportunity to discover that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless the US can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of the two rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has been stuck on a dead end for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it’s a “flame of hope” that the ongoing sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration ending the Korean War could someday bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps toward disarmament.
US President Donald Trump and Kim want a second summit.
There is, however, widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris shows show that the latest trend of huge headgear will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy huge headgear for their Spring/Summer 2019 collections at a parade that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
Valentino's exhibition piece was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge reminiscent of feathers that flooded the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included decorated melons, a witch's hat, and even pineapples—but they're not meant to warm your head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One piece resembled diving gear with snorkels and goggles, while the other looked like a cornucopia with melted ice cream.
And if you continue with the huge fashion – you are lucky.
Fashion experts predict that huge caps could even reach fashion stores.
Overgrown hats come after "La Bomba", a straw with a half-meter wide cr<0xC3><0xA8>me that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski was wearing.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat that has flooded social media has sent another giant creation to the pier – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
Dark orange raffia bag lined with raffia fringes and equipped with a handle of white leather was at the Paris Fashion Week an exhibition piece of the collection La Riviera spring/summer 2019 by Jacquesmuse.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in fashion stores for next summer – given that the designer has had such great success with them, it would hardly be possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have had a number of academic successes and this continues in 2018 with other excellent exam results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
These schools have more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) and aim to provide their pupils and parents with the best possible level of service.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individualized school curricula, we see that modern languages are still popular and in demand in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language he understands, it goes straight to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is an important observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year’s exams show that languages come first in the tables, with independent schools having the highest success rate.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade of A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that 72 per cent of Mandarin students, 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students achieved the highest A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by pupils are as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the study plans of independent and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of job vacancies are due to reasons employers cite as vacancy problems.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more jobs require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world.
Whatever career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future that he has such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages automatically gains an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, namely 15 percent, was French.
Therefore, it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children know more languages, especially the languages of emerging economies, they will be more likely to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in what languages it teaches.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the child is interested in, he will always have a choice of several languages at independent schools with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At this point, it cannot be denied that languages are essential for the future of the country in the global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and landmark to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will perform for the first time in the Lakers jersey in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking forward to LeBron James' first appearance at the Los Angeles Lakers will soon see.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening match of the San Diego preseason against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season matches,” he said.
Trump's performance in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign speeches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five meetings scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote to confirm his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s show start tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. Eastern Time, on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nominee, which took place this week and was very tense over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed by a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of meetings is to help Republicans gain momentum ahead of the November elections.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five gatherings next week aim to “energize volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.”
“Senate control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible during this busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania” could come to the Wesbanco Arena meeting in Wheeling today and be watched by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia, where he scored more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate nominee for West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“For Morrisey, it’s not a good sign that the president has to come to help him with his research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Its Stomach to Fight to Keep It Hopeful Before Sunday’s Singles
After three one-sided matches, Saturday’s pairs could be just what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where does the pendulum swing now?
"They've led by six points and now they're four, so we're taking the pendulum as moving a little bit towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points, and there are still twelve points left.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little bit of wind in the sails, and there are many things that can cheer them up, for example, the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each can boast of three points out of four.
Spieth was lethal in the transition from the launch pad to the green, and he sets an example.
The cries of celebration were further amplified in the continuation of his round, when he managed a key hurdle to win the entire match, when they were two holes behind Tomas after two.
His putt, who won their 15-hole game, met a similar roar that tells you that the American team is not out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to leave a trail.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but adorable couples from Europe are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
Moliwood was the only couple who missed the hole on Saturday afternoon, but also missed Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
The course and the way the energy flows both towards the turbulent audience confirms from him that these are the players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that by sunset there will be no more popular player over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is best to both at the same time on a different hole.
However, the talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The hole and two doubles on the front nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in the abyss from which they had not climbed.
No one will help you on Sunday.
Two-pair two-ball games are so fascinating when you closely watch the interactions of people in a pair, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the last day, but this game of two pairs also showed that the US team has a stomach for a fight that some, especially from the states, doubted.
Europe leads to the final day of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage by the last day of the Ryder Cup, then from Saturday's doubles games on two balls came out with a lead of 10-6 over the United States.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly nearly won twice over wrestling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four cuts at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost in Hazeltine, dominated the morning two-ball games with the American side, which failed in the 3-1 series.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two matches, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair to win four points from their four opening games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating players Woods and Patrick Reed in a two-ball game and then smoothly beat tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who ran through two games on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but now lost 19 of his 29 games in a two-ball doubles game and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a two-ball game in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in a doubles game on the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not win the whole line on this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
The three-time main winner, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and returned later to beat the pair of Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a doubles game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team returns from a four-point deficit to singles, although as the defending Furyk side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that the Sunday counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that continued U.N. sanctions had deepened its distrust of the United States, and under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see a corresponding response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is impossible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “gradual” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for every step it took, his statement seemed significant in not rejecting unilateral denuclearization just because Pyongyang had gone through it in the past.
Ri mentioned the joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the Korean peninsula” while Trump pledged guarantees of North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure on sanctions to enforce its goals, and even opposes ‘declaring an end to the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea and not the US were on the side of the denuclearization issue, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
However, Ri’s tone was dramatically different from last year’s one when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting on U.S. soil was inevitable after Trump’s “Mr. Evil President” labeled Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still had to be done and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea was completely denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timeframe for that, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without ceasing until we realize complete, definitive, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the UN General Assembly side, and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and declared that progress had been made only for North Korea to declare within hours that he was making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he hoped were the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has led all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studios all night long, where students don’t sleep and are encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most renowned university are often helpless when it comes to taking care of themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in my senior year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were really seriously sleepy during the week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of student dormitories where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleeping habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have the right to know – just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Czeisler added.
A culture of pride in “all night studying” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is also growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, because sleep deprivation switches the brain to starvation mode, so the person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes attended last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting the alarm at the time when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Menga's hit confirmed Steven Gerrard's dissatisfaction with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox party tried to record their first victory from February 4 to February 1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers seemed uninspired and determined to make up for it.
While the Rangers are now down to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and just behind the Hibernian team as opposed to one goal.
And there could be more Rangers problems after the line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the auditorium.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which swept past Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who scored a Hearts point last week and would have been delighted as his well-trained team strangled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start when Menga first let Scott Pittman in Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder buried his big chance.
A long free kick by Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Lithgow could only tempt at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but it seemed that in the last third there would be more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have a quarter-hour penalty when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but referee Steven Thomson swept the Colombian challenge from the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots at the finish line in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's meek shot.
While Livi's opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the hard work.
The Rangers again failed to deal with the deep Jacobs set.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and took Menga to the easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost instantaneous result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly fought off the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of exactly the kind they liked when Lithgow and Halkett were throwing one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened its lead in the final stages, but McGregor was well placed to block Jacobs before Litgow ran from the corner.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and it is still growing... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for the detection and measurement of radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter also became a constant pop culture at the time, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to localize radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Well, now it's really cracking!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Dangerous Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize dangerous cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can "see" the protein that is common to many cancers, and then the rivet is injected again
The trial vaccine has shown promising results in patients with multiple cancers.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize dangerous cells has had ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2 and then be reapplied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach, when immune cells were taken from patients and “learned” to focus on cancer cells, has already been promoted in the treatment of the type of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, in his maga cap, after his performance at SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was squealed at Saturday Night Live after a confused speech praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run in 2020.
After singing a third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he spit on the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you love Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I was bothered by racism, I wouldn’t be in America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL launched a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the rape charge against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornament had been eaten well behind the scenes.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullying!
They also said I was in the wrong place," the Washington Examiner said.
West went on, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" and added that he would "put on his superman suit because it means you can't tell me what to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments earned only the buzz of the audience at least twice, and the SNL members looked scandalized, embarrassed, Variety says, and one person even said, “The whole studio is completely silent.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many of those present by singing the song "I Love" disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA's lead conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most daring characters: THANK YOU FOR SES PLAYING THE DAWN."
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West “was just who he is, and that’s absolutely amazing.”
But I DON’T WANT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or by supporting his ‘art’) who I believe represents and sends into the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's single.
Just like us," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A colleague rapper, Snoop Dogg, formerly called Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then an artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was killed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is due to stand trial in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy series HBO.
However, the actor, 31, stepped out of the stereotype of macho hero and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believed “something is wrong” and asked how to address toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of the Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted to having “quite a strong voice” on the issue.
"At this point, I personally feel, quite strongly - what's so bad about masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach a teenage man about the problem we're seeing right now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on TV, on the streets, from the feeling that every man needs to have his own side?
I think that's really one of the big questions in our time - how to change it?
Because the young man must have changed for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel Game of Thrones after the series is over, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored True West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, a burglar.
The actor recently revealed that meeting with his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the show, so he gave me my future family and my entire life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit's character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by this virus in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people year-on-year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Considering the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases come from insufficient sexual protection during these intercourses.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff would let GOP senators’ data escape, bends over the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had sent personal data from three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the charges were backed up by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other contemptible lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday on the Internet and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred sometime after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that the sources of the posts are associated with Waters’ office and have published information about Waters’ staff members, Hill says.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outraged," Fleischer wrote.
"That suggests he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they have not done, they must not be angry.
They must not be rebellious.
The plaintiff's motives must not be questioned.
They need to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who took part in the election against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If it were true, it would be something,” he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said her office had alerted “competent authorities and law enforcement authorities to these fraudulent claims.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which are devastating and dangerous to everyone and to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English hits reviews again – weaker spy parody Rowan Atkinson
It’s already common to look for Brexit in every new British-tendent film, which seems to be the case with this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies – which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this brazen satire about how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this bulging, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber face had his license to mess things up again in a whole new way — that name more than anything else is a signal that it’s a broad comic book intended for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the dull undercover agent who, despite his bizarre claims on smoothie glamour, has a bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean, and a big cuddle of the guy who sung a single tone in Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
The character is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man, whom Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, and who left behind chaos.
In this latest edition of JE you will find one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the blades of the rotor briefly clinked about his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is exposed, but the humor feels quite subdimensional and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like it’s meant for kids than for adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy trampots are as inventive and focused as Mr. Bean’s silent film gags.
The current assumption is that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a British super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the horror of an agent on duty – a too small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a prime minister who’s a pompous and biased character who’s already suffering under a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson plays the character as best she can, but there’s not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that once every active spy of hers is in danger, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director at some luxury facility, but at the same time gives record-breaking lessons on how to be a secret agent: here are some nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his long-suffering former partner, Bough, who was again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with a submarine commander, an affective figure to whom Vicki Pepperdine may be wasting a little bit of his talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action in packing assignments for Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of farcical pavilions: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos as they sneak aboard Volt's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy when they try to get to know the interior of Volt's house with virtual reality.
All the aces are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and turbulent it is, it has something in it from the children's television.
Quite a moderate thing.
And as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder: couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matches his talent?
Labour denies developing a plan for Englishmen to work four days a week and get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is set to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to hand over to the workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend – but would still take the same reward.
Sources say the idea would fit into the party’s economic agenda and plan to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of changing economies.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “The evaluation of this measure is expected to be announced by the end of the year.
It doesn’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the party’s stance on balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is currently not approved by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the policy of our party and the party does not take it into account."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not return to their total stake, as the Labour government could make “collapses” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the boards of directors of companies and create own-ownership funds, which will transfer 10% of the equity of private enterprises to employees who are entitled to payment of annual dividends up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on the show “60 Minutes” whether the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could have changed their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency's findings could rock some Republican senators into campaigning for their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes," correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could reveal anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the charges came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's decision, however, is unshakable.
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and that would be a really explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of those she named could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Music Festival will take place in New York City, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival in its seventh year will welcome tens of thousands of people to meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of quests or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it reached its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really in a way that convinces them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people who feel that by signing an online petition or sending a tweet, something will change?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has seen more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and notifications arising from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children grow to their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice in the form of malnutrition a mere remark in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s New York City show, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for “blockade” that would prevent Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington could resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from invading markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to mediate energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our Navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy is not going to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that is perceived in the US as the “voice of the energy consumer”.
He compared Washington’s approach and negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to invest in or replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-purpose” player with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “handmaid” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which aims to double its existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent resistance to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose a supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US took a position from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to avoid EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Promises to “Look Close” for 2020 Presidential Candidate, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after the midterm elections, she would "look closely" at her candidacy for president.
During a meeting of the City Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will take a closer look at the presidential candidacy."
During the meeting, Warren also mentioned Donald Trump and said she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-ranking Democratic names that have been talked about in connection with a potential bid by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make the decision officially in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being put on the list in September.
He was arrested on Monday and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after his return, may be about other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning to,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a “room elephant” and said of her son and other war veterans that “something else is coming back, they’re coming back solid, they’re coming back, and they’re asking if there’s any respect for the things their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the army, give to their country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence, and holding a gun intoxicated, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 States, D.C. Supports Call for New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal call for new U.S. government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Washington on Friday issued a brief report to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Organization against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of a violent gang" had abused her, but US officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates for states supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing ubiquitous gang problems and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the immigrant appeals chamber that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement Friday that the new measures “ignore decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the short friend said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that policies that deny immigration hurt the U.S. economy and said they were more likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already doubled, race to find survivors with time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who comforted her feverish boy at an evacuation center in the arid city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes, picking themselves up through soaked things and trying to save whatever they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals that were destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were paralyzed.
Some injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside for continuing severe subsequent concussions.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to be saved.
I think I was dragged into the ruins of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Mobbing” Propaganda Ads
A week after the official Chinese daily published a four-page ad in an American daily that addressed the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned a paid China Daily surcharge on Wednesday in the Des Moines Register — the state of Iowa’s biggest selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said Reuters was a new phase of an escalating campaign by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which is reflected in the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had injured U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an opinion in the Sunday Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American precious tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the Beijing street newspaper stand, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the discordant views that the Chinese might have on China’s disturbing economic path, given that the media belongs to the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans Leave Voters Before Elections Over Kavanaugh Debacle, Analysts Warn
As many top Republicans defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections, they will recognize the response, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this case were extremely high, and most Republicans on the record are already saying they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) at the last minute to seek an FBI investigation would be enough to calm voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow or even in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, chief counsel and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the hallway of the Senate, where Republicans in charge of the Judiciary Commission decided to appoint Kavanaugh despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already been high, that's true."
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not go to the polls.
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if the Republicans confirmed, there might be resistance.
“It was a confusing mess for the GOP,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the chair, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, the director of U.S. priorities, a group that helps vote for Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in the opinion of whom to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimonies, with somewhat more sympathy for the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new Internet and overtake Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is trying to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee’s Open Source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project was “world domination.”
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, Inrupt’s goal is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project, collaborated on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with “Facebook and Google are not talking about making a complete change where all their business models are upside down overnight.
"We're not asking for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release published on Saturday that the mission of the Inrupt project is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the priest who received the Victorian Cross during World War I
Celebrations have taken place hundreds of years since the only Anglican clergyman to receive Victoria's Cross as a warrior during World War I.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, and he never learned that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandsons unveiled a memorial stone to him on Saturday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "genius symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's victory.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with very dense fog and heavy gunfire.
He later made it to the front line and, with "the highest courage" he led the line forward before throwing himself into the field of fire and knocking out three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that is humiliating.”
Together with their brother Dr. James Vann, they laid a wreath after a show led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt great honor to be able to participate in the parade,” adding that “the courage of a true hero is manifested by the support that many people will provide.”
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, you waited all night to watch the pompous Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The receipt from San José contained 13 points, including six on the main card and a live broadcast in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in the UK were stunned when news turned into a Peppa piggy show.
Some remained unaffected after waking up to the early hours of the morning for the match.
One Twitter fan described the change in broadcasts to the children’s show as “a certain form of bad joke.”
“According to government regulations, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m. and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, after being interviewed for the broadcast.
"Pig Peppa," yes.
Bellator president Scott Coker said they will work on the program to ensure that UK audiences are involved in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't do it until Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were very friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was the government's fault.
I promise you it won't happen again.
We’re reducing it to five games instead of six – as we usually do – and we tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we didn’t make it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “minor” because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first disc of Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loud about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that due to the possibility of becoming a parent, he was less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter on the long-running show, had a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a wrecker in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone who grew up with him because "it was not socially unacceptable for you to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness were real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone who could possibly find out what was going on with his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a high-profile LGBT rights activist and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he responded because he felt lucky to be able to live openly with no consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the man - American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "was caught unprepared."
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years older, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age — he was at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later — he said it wasn’t easy to find someone at the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June, and Daley said he had "changed his whole point of view".
“If you asked me last year, it would be like ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t want him to die, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and was dead that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
A year later, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I’d dreamed of it all my life – jumping in front of our home team at the Olympics, I don’t know how to feel better,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song – The Stream by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still evokes goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of shape, on Saturday in the Ryder Cup ended up on the bench
American Phil Mickelson would have reached the record on Sunday when he played 47, the Ryder Cup match, but he would have to tune the form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years for the twelfth time, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk to the bench at Saturday's Fourballs and Foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time main winner spent his day alternately between cheerleading and playing in a row hoping to fix what was bothering him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most direct of the drivers, even at the height of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National field, where long, rugged terrain routinely punishes stray bullets.
And unless the golf course itself is disturbing enough, Mickelson faces the ninth Sunday match of the exact champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who won all four of his games with rookie Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped the rapid onset, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and gave nothing else.
“He totally understands the role he had today, slaps me on the back, puts his hand around my shoulders and says he’ll be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
"He trusts himself so much.
He is a member of the Straw Hall and in the past this week he was so beneficial for these teams.
I guess I couldn't imagine him playing two kittens.
I imagined more, but that's how it developed and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record in most Ryder Cup events on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his team presence brought some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, likes to make fun of people, and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he said.
“I think the younger players also had fun going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Leadership May Soon Disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that the big lead heading to the singles of the last days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut at a 1997 match in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they reached the finish line with a narrow victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You have to keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderram, as well as in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderram, where we won, but only very close,” Bjorn said, after watching them win 5-3 in 2018 on Friday and yesterday to have Le Golf National lead 10-6.
So history and every member of the team have shown me that this is not behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go in there and do all the right things.
It's not over until all the points are on the board.
Our goal is to try and win the trophy, and that's what we're focusing on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to do on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players behaved on the complex golf course, added: “I could never do it myself.
Tomorrow we have another animal.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that is very difficult.
It’s great to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re there to be on your own, your golf player capacity is fully tested.
This is the message that you have to pass on to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players play better as individuals than as partners. Exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these big turns when he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn, to then end up as a loser when Europe achieved the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain of 1999, encouraged his players to head to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
That's how we set up the line-up and made the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in the top match with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, which are the other Europeans in the top half.
“I went with that group of boys in that order because I think it covers the whole trip,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
The German warship has been delayed again.
The latest German naval frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and snowy coastlines, local media reported.
The launch of the flagship Rheinland-Pfalz, the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, an army spokesman.
The vessel was to become part of the Navy in 2014, but the challenging after-delivery issues have made the fate of this ambitious project frustrating.
As a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates, four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will serve, which the Navy ordered in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies, such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside of domestic ports.
But the constant delays mean that top-class naval vessels – supposedly designed to allow Germany to send troops overseas – will be obsolete by the time they are put into service.
The notorious F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturer after handing it over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of major "software errors and defects on metal elements" defects that would render a warship useless when deployed in combat.
Defects in the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half of the personnel needed on the Bremen-class frigates.
The ship has also been shown to be significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz will be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects on metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion, the price has risen to a dizzying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have gained traction, especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the naval army is indeed “coming ships capable of deployment.”
This representative said that the problems were constantly being unpacked, as the old ships were decommissioned, but no replacements were provided.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were capable of becoming part of the Navy's equipment.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats.
New research is underway at the bat habitat in the Scottish Highlands to uncover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the research findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future activities to preserve this species.
The study, which is being carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland Association, will track bats of whistles and the smallest and brownest long-tailed and aquatic bats at the Inverewe Gardens Botanical Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas in this bat habitat, which will monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
An expert audio analysis of all recordings will find out the frequency of calls of bats and what each species does.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be released, which will create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Natural Resources Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, and best practice in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain has been declining significantly in the last century.
They are endangered as a result of construction and territorial development that affect colonies and the natural environment.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials and cat attacks can also pose a risk.
Fleas are not actually blind.
Because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting prey.
They use a sophisticated echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony inspections and sometimes also rescue work.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reservation at the Three Mansion in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten bat species in Scotland.
Residential manager David Thompson says it's ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Threeve," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitat.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It stresses the importance of controlling bats before starting maintenance work in real estate, as it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one maternal nest can kill up to 400 females and young, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to put their hand in the work and help.
She said, “We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don’t know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Allegations, His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to become more visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German daily Der Spiegel, which reported on the allegations.
This Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the case, the daily Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was released, Ronaldo, 33, spoke in a live Instagram video to his 142 million followers, calling the information “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball winner said.
"They want to live on my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I’m happy and I’m fine,” the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are going to indict the newspaper Der Spiegel for unfounded accusations that they described as “inadmissible notification of a suspicion in the private sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount corresponding to the severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent times.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the game room, where she was allegedly anally raped according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent” “good” and “one percent” disappointed.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to reopen the proceedings because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million this summer after being accused of attacking him just a few steps after moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United.
Brexit: Britain will forever regret the loss of car manufacturers
The UK will “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Greg Clark, secretary for companies.
He said it was “disturbing” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the borders in the event of no Brexit deal could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if the UK abruptly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen a halt in production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
Other carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal when it comes to the functioning of cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car plant in Oxford just a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers call supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts from suppliers in the UK and the EU delivered to custom-made cars within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and a shortage of spare parts.
For Toyota, it would be impossible to have more than one day in stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus the production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to revive future relations with the EU were “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the grasp of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The proof not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful supply chain set.”
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the head of the union at the plant, said: “I have experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
A high-level meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “suspended for another week” as the fight for the post of Supreme Court Justice with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller’s special council, which is investigating interference in the Russian election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump dismisses the acting attorney general and threatens Mueller’s independence, Washington’s gossip has fed up for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of ousting the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not “prefer” to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid conflicting with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate’s full vote again.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There is no date yet, it may be this week, it may be necessary to move by another week, given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see and I’ll always share the news with the media.”
Some reporters disagree: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that too few press conferences were not due to an aversion to the "divadelle" of television reporters, even though she said, "I don't agree with the fact that they're going to perform."
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more question and answer sessions than any president before him,” she added, without providing evidence.
The conferences will continue, Sanders said, but “if the press had the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We’re testing it, and you’ve seen that we’ve been doing it for the last few weeks, and there’s going to be a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly receives inquiries when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president probably showed why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre look in front of the assembled reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to SMEs less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to settle the costs of applications for settlement status of EU citizens working in the public services transferred.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are continuing, and they are moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to assure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our heartfelt wish is that you stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie advances emergency surgery after head injury
Expelled defender Tigers of Tennessee Christion Abercrombie advanced to emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat from rival Vanderbilt Commodores, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before half-time.
"He came to the sidelines and just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and paramedics put oxygen on Abercrombie's sideline and then put him on a stretcher and prepared him for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had advanced surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details on the type/range of the injury are yet available” and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in a red shirt, finishes his first season for the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total interventions, which means a total of 18 interventions per season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under the new Tory plans
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s move to attract young voters.
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to people who do not pay taxes in the UK
<0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Buyers from abroad will pay a higher tax on buying property when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and focus on high-income people.
The increase in property tax will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, while the money will also strengthen the government’s efforts to fight roofless sleep.
The surcharge, which is an addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including higher levels introduced two years ago in other homes and purchases for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
It is expected that the state treasury will increase funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
Estimates say that 13 percent of non-UK residents buy newly built properties in London, which knocks out prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get on the home charts.
Many of the country’s richest areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” precisely because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut on property purchases to help more young people move into their own first home.
He accused major construction firms of holding real estate prices high by seizing land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes in order to fix the “hostility home” in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced an exciting series of proposed housing reforms, including the management of rents and the end of “harmless” evictions.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I want to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to renewing the British dream – so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means repairing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape life here.
However, it may not be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For many people, the dream of their own home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.
Jack Ross: “My highest ambition is to drive Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "highest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is looking forward to the challenge of resuming the Northeastern club, which currently holds the third position in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer, he moved to Stadium of Light after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-rank and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that draws me back.
That would only happen if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn’t feel any anxiety about succeeding such established names at such a big club when he had previously turned down pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the time would have been measured by whether I could bring this club back to the Premier League.
“Because of the structure and equipment in this club, it is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy task to bring him back, but I think I’d feel successful if I could bring the club back.”
Ross has only had a career in leadership for three years, previously serving as an auxiliary boss at Dumarton, and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Aloa recover from their descent into the third group and transformed St. Mirren from an early decline into a champions title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels much better now than he has ever had players at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalls when he took Aloe.
“I really believed that leadership was right for me, more than just playing.
It sounds strange, because I was good, earning well and enjoying a reasonable amount.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still go through them in terms of stress and pressure of the work, but in leadership I just feel good.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I feel the most in my skin right now in my entire adult life.”

Research Finds Great Time to Pint on Saturdays at 5:30 PM
The summer heat wave has increased the income of struggling British pubs, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the consulting firm that produced the final reports, said: “Stable sunshine and longer-than-expected England participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, when pub attendance increased by 2.8 percent, but restaurants were even more affected.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that attract drinks have hitherto behaved the most in the same way as restaurants have offended themselves.
Pubs, whose main revenues are from food, have also suffered from the sun, albeit not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell three percent.”
Paul Newman of the leisure and hospitality analytics firm said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the domestic market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8 percent annual decline in sales will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food-loving business operators, and time will tell if the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring much-needed relief.”
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with combined sales of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, an industry benchmark in the industry.

Research Among 20,000 High School Students Shows Increase in ‘Fake Instagram Pages’
Reports have raised concerns that sexual content is being published
Twenty percent of students say they have a “major” account that their parents know about
One in five children – aged just 11 – creates accounts on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” where they share photos.
Reports point to concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of pupils said they had a “major” account embellished, which their parents knew about, while also having a private account.
A mother who ran into her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found her teenage daughter encouraging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11 to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to keeping private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most acclaimed lightweight athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in the leadership of the sport as those for whom her far-reaching international experience over the past decade will be useful.
“Eilidh has a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland to be a member of the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be truly beneficial and to help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 in the 200 and 400 metres, won four gold medals in total and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “I had an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to make a full recovery, I've learned to walk again, and today I'm practicing!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!”
A milk sucker evoking the comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
A sucker company has divided online opinion by advertising that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of the “world’s first silent wearable suction cup,” Envi has released a music video with an exaggeration showing the freedom that the new suction cup gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing in a barn full of hay and cows to a song with the lyrics, “Yes, I’m touching, but you don’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed I don’t have veggies, here are my breasts.”
The congregation continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I drink my beloved milk.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, provoked online controversial reactions.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, many of whom reported that it sheds light on the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very pathetic decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
“Like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth so they can give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after birth.”
The suction cup Elvie is discreetly applied to the nursing breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Clearly traumatic for mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise on a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely out of place.”
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "contagious".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get the pump if I was still breast-feeding.
I feel like a cow when I suck.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's good.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
Another added: “It’s a fun commercial aimed at mothers who suck their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement to praise or curse the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are all dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that many women who suck milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and beautifully hides in a breastfeeding bra, so it gives women freedom of movement, the ability to hold the baby and even when suctioning to walk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point out the milk extraction and all the challenges associated with it, while showing the fun and reliable incredible feeling of freedom that the new hood will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's suction cup has come to the fore.
During the London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers of designer Marta Jakubowski, who was just using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially since the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of jeopardizing their ability to stay in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households had to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who had requested escort status for single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
As many as 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to prosecute them," Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum officials, in an effort to speed up the handling of cases involving children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month before detention, rather than the earlier standard 60 days.
Many will appear via videoconferencing calls instead of personally declaring their case legal status for an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer a child is in custody, the more likely he is to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum workers say, reporting from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child suffering are more likely to be overlooked, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends could trigger a trauma that many children are already battling.
Syria announces immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupational forces”
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also acting prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian territory were illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "this will be handled accordingly."
"They must give up immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror in Syria is almost over,” with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more losing their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting in this holy battle until we have rid all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal aliens present.”
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Moualem said the conditions were good for them to return, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We have reached out to international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a protection zone in the last Idlib refuge has created an opportunity to move forward in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the agreement had "clearly set deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including Nusra Front fighters linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections will soon take place.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning against intervention.
Why Trump Will Win in the Second Period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the prosecution and scandals would not end his presidency prematurely.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, mainstream streaming has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen and the "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC, which has increased cable TV viewers to 3.5 million following mainstream nighttime news.
“It’s a fervor that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the operator of Designated Survivor, told ABC’s drama about a cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he's funny,' Mrs. Scovel told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reunite and for the benefit of the global economy.
Tuning is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep backup” resources for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jackets worth $15,000 (“dressing arrogance” as the Washington Post put it) and the consequences of Mr. Trump’s disgusting portrayal of “anatomy.”
I’m not going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does and what makes the reality show feel like he’s feeding you every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show in which he praises Kim Jong-un.

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny outside on the north bank of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he was trapped inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
"I remember doing all these crazy shows and people saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows to the tightest domestic races of the medium-term election
Unsurprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th precinct is experiencing an influx of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional precincts generated by the two office holders in the fight for the same chair.
This recently led to the transformation of Pittsburgh suburban district by Democratic District Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another holder of office, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a sharp financial rift between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania for its close victory in the March special election to the 18th congressional district.
This chair has been occupied by the Republican for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Politicians give Democrats a slight lead.
U.S. to fine El Salvador for supporting China, then backs down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until partners judicially evicted the Trump administration’s organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. directors of the diplomatic mission from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan any more,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement issued earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development, and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts to financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North and Central American leaders postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had clarified that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any contemplated fines for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of the administration’s signal at the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new indomitable news from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on anonymity terms.
Their sources were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study History
A definitive nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from the special commission on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of law enforcement, of which there is now a lot of evidence in public records.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller is also reportedly addressing whether Mr. Trump’s campaign contained a secret agreement with Russia to attack our elections.
If there were an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to stand before that body, just as he is preparing to stand before voters again, and in the end, he would probably be waiting for a jury composed of his colleagues.
That’s a lot of “ifs,” and I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – as with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice in front of us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, all that was needed was for the Western powers to stand up to him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that speed up or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been swayed since the report announced that he had suggested secretly recording the president last year and speculated that he was not in a state of health to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, the versions of The Times are inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite convincing allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
Most importantly, are we going to vote in the middle of a term of office for a Congress that will assign responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will face a long dark night.
But I believe that we will not fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, on the Sabbath she sent me to light candles on a table with a swastika.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month would give them great hope for progress from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went into a fight with the belief that we could take something and we took a point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it at the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better and we were better.
On Thursday, it will be another big European night.
I hope that we can get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last match they scored a good result. However, with the audience behind me, I am sure that we can push and it will turn out well.
Last year was pretty tough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel very good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is also good.
I hope that we can get back on track now, put last season behind us and be successful.”
Women are worried about retirement savings.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in pricing.
Invite your financial advisor: The advisor can help you find a way to reimburse these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by using traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance using your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Appoint a healthcare representative, who will be the trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing a power of attorney for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure that your accounts are paid if you are not eligible to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent urgently needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just finances, but what are the names of the treating doctors?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Keep that plan at hand.”
A man in Ilfracombe was shot several times from an air gun.
When the man returned home on foot after a night's sleep, he was struck by several shots from an air gun.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an “accidental act”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities, the death toll is expected to rise further.
Because the communications are out of operation, the auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the Regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowali on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggalu have been hit by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the Donggale tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur here regularly.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake hit the Pidia Jay Regency in Aceh province and caused destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29, living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, disrupting reports of domestic violence and preventing arrest.
According to a police report, when his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, Palin took her phone.
Palin has been shipped to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network’s report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt “definitely innocent” when asked for his statement.
Palin faces three class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B offence, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This isn’t the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violating reports of domestic violence, and possession of a weapon under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by war veteran groups for linking her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck directly at the center of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There were videos on social media depicting the moment of disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Demand Extraordinary Death Penalty for NYC Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – an exceptional sentence that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan district in October using a rented Home Depot truck to sweep pedestrians and cyclists away.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - this is how the terms of the intention to grant the death penalty are defined according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both of these numbers would mean the possibility of granting the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including murder charges for extortion, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and preparation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saip’s actions were carried out as abhorrent, cruel and perverse.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pamijeman."
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last handed down the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York City in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were executed, who had been shown conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs sat on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown minimal regret, according to court documents, during the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he felt good about what he had done.
According to the charges, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching videos of the Islamic State on the phone.
Police also said they wanted the Islamic State flag to be displayed in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent of the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “obviously disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt and a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team had previously asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be tasked with Brexit negotiations by NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage, during today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference, pledged to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of her own MPs, Theresa May, suggested, he should be the one to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said during a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the problem Mrs May faces in reconciling her ranks, where there is a deep rift, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan of Chequers running under the attacks of Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the Union and the EU itself.
The Allies insist that they will continue to seek an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone said the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “cough Chequers.”
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and have responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we'd be out today, 'he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight world wars to have to listen.
In our own country, we want to make our own laws.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their mind and want to stay is completely vague.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, and he is not liked by our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp message to Mrs May, she says, 'Ministry presidents will retain their seats as long as they keep their promises.'
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an embarrassment” if they want to betray their decision made following the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a report to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilizing the army of the people of this country that secured us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Britain that rules itself.”
Proponents of staying in the Union, meanwhile, marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city center.
Several activists waved banners to the Conservatives against Brexit after the party’s opening weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives over security concerns over the party's application after the conference began.
“These are the people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for seamless borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
It's all a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Rethink’ Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “think carefully about running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is attempting a November re-election against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s action in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to run for president.
Warren said it was time “for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, which means a woman at the top.”
Suspect arrested for shooting Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., on Saturday announced that they had detained a suspect in Friday's shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims.
The police department in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video of Friday's shooting was released requesting the identification of the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the campus of Southern University.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that was inconsistent with life,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media via 247sports.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to moving around the scene, carrying a gun, and confessing to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was shot without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-and-six-inch-tall Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approached the title of world champion, when the team’s direction took the victory over Sebastian Vettel into his hands
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday’s qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes’ team-direction would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the pole position and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and called on Vettel to attack the teammate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch up with the cars circling on the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes rider drove to the depot a round later and after the exit, he was behind Vettel. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a close fight, the Ferrari rider had to reluctantly leave the inner track free in order to defend in the third corner after a double maneuver.
Max Verstappen took off from the back row of the field and at the end of the first round was in the lead on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then drove for a large part of the race, as he held the original tyres as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and could take Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
He ended up in the depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could no longer raise the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team did a fantastic job and the reward is the first two places,” Hamilton said.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's assembly for insisting she did not publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a rally in West Virginia, he did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission, instead stating that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and disgusting and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and the wonderful thing that’s been happening in the last days of the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see those people being angry and angry and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“If you look at the publication and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, do you mind for the leak?
Remember her answer... you posted that document-- oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Feinstein sent a letter to Ford detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and information leaked in early September — but Feinstein refused to let her out of office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose the case," Feinstein said, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
But the president, who spoke at a meeting on Saturday night, apparently did not believe her words: “I’ll tell you, it’s really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who had been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and indicated that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by whatever means are available.
"You see the vile, the abominable, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to kick in the ground to get back to power and to the helm," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's rematch at Dundee, which ended 5–3.
The Giants soon took the double-decker lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make it home before Dwyer returned to the Giants.
Francois Bouchard then tied again for Dundee, after which two goals of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League of the season for Adam Keefe, who defeated 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
The two teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games being dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, with the help of Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford credited the assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got home back into the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, which he compared at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went to the cabins for the first break, after all, in the lead, when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard again managed to score a goal from the overpowering game in a time of 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen swing the lead to Dundee for the first time in the match in the second third, and the same player insures his team's lead in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of their last five games, will play the next match at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to allow hundreds of people on board plane to escape earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after he died while overseeing a plane carrying hundreds of people aboard to safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the Sulawesi island was shaken by a major earthquake on Friday that caused a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But even as fellow 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung fled to save his own life, he refused to leave his seat in the wildly faltering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in position to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped down from the control tower as he thought he was coming down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia ABC News that the decision helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which took him to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this news," he added.
Meanwhile, the responsible authorities have expressed concern that the number of deaths could reach thousands. The agency responsible for dealing with the disaster said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is still increasing, as many bodies remain unreleased under the wreckage and many of them have not yet been reached by rescuers," a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugro said in a statement.
The waves in the devastated Pal reached a height of up to six meters, and mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings more bodies here.
There's a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the ground.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be even worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night and complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
An airline operating a flight that crashed in a lagoon on a Micronesian island in the Pacific has now said one person is missing, initially alleging that all passengers and crew of a total of 47 people were safely evacuated from a sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to find one passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for details of that passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in treatment on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in a lagoon before landing.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes further stated that he and others managed to get water up the belt deep to the emergency exits of the sinking aircraft.
He further stated that the cabin crew were panicking and screaming and that he himself had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked nearby on the pier’s modifications helped rescue the inflatable boat carrying passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-branded aircraft crashes over the past two decades, but no crashes have occurred to Air Niuguni.
An analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday ended its speech in this case, in which a man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert opinions in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury drew a scenario of how he used the cell phone records of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous resignation, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When his cell phone records showed that he had spent the night with Chambers, he reported that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before the council and testified that the day was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another discrepancy was that Tellis reported that he knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
However, the cell phone records indicate that the two had known each other for only a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to be brought before a jury later that day.
High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and re-popularize hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?
New York Educator Sues Couple for Her Dismissal After ‘Racist’ Text Message
A New York City schoolteacher is suing the couple for their discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misspelled text message from her mother in which she was labeled “another black” text message.
The couple denied being racist and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to discover on her first day at work in 2016 that her new child caregiver, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"Non-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Pi Maurice.
When she understood her faux pas, “concerned” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice and said that her outgoing tutor, who was African-American, was working really badly and that she was expecting a Filipina instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for quitting her job and demanding compensation of $350 per day for a six-month engagement, for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” she told the Post this Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the couple retaliated by saying that they were not racists, but that the termination of Mrs. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared they could no longer trust her after the insult.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you put your child in the hands of someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was only caring for a two-month-old child and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“Would you drive like this?
This is not a nice thing at all," the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit still persists, the jury on social media very quickly condemned the couple for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of the stories about the teddy bear Paddington feared that readers did not identify with the talking bear, show the latest news
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, told the reporter: “It’s hard to empathize with the situation of someone reading it for the first time, even before it’s published.
It’s fun to know that now that we know Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a small teddy bear, was very disappointed that his work had been rejected, adding on the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, which became a "sweet-bitter" point after his death last year.
To Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of her family," she added that her father was very proud of his final success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never in any way boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was such a real figure for him, it was like having a child who has achieved something you can be really proud of.
I believe that Paddington's success was reflected in this view.
Even though it was just his creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes to Paddington alone.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were trying to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it's really bad and that he doesn't expect her to get out of it," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a phone call from Nada telling me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dearly.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
The medication the doctors gave her to keep her heart running was slowly losing its effectiveness and leaving her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything had closed.
I just had to sit and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
"I kept my head down, tears running down my cheeks the whole time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt an overwhelming understanding of Nada.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women Send Postcards to Prevent Suicides on Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sending out Welsh Bridge postcards with inspirational messages and phone numbers where people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and as a result, took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want any other parent to have to feel what I felt every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, who is 45 and lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up every room.”
However, before he died, he left work because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his sibling’s immobile body after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, “I’m always worried about the impact this will have on his life.”
Mrs. Davis suggested postcards “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them, even if they are their friends.
Don’t be silent – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, an old friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down, or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we saw a change in his behavior.
The worst thing was on Christmas Day – when the kids opened the presents, they didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she must gradually get over it: “Such a thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It tore us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's Future Depends on Balance as FBI Begins Investigation
"I thought that we could get something that he actually asked for - investigations at a time of limitation, with a limited scope - we could bring a little unity into it," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "break up" because both sides would bury themselves in the captured positions.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, on November 6, and if the Republicans behave badly as expected, it will lead to their fundamental weakening in attempts to push the man they want into office at the country's highest court.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators, lobbied for them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush, and met with his wife Ashley, then Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on this, with 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats present.
Still, it is unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which has allowed Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean Refugees 'Down' Under Kim
The number of refugees from North to South Korea has fallen since the start of Kim Jong-un’s rule seven years ago, according to South Korean lawmakers.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there had been 1,127 escapes over the past year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park also said that this was due to tighter checks at the North Korean-Chinese border and higher rates of smugglers at the border.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them flee through China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants and not as refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at halting denuclearization talks.
This was the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on extensive terms of cooperation in nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on sanctions.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this point in an interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
“I couldn’t help but if any woman had ever performed such a theater, they would have called it ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected all accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both still in puberty.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating when discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly denounced the Democrats in the committee, saying their accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated attack” orchestrated by liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential election defeat.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony proved he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he relied on the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh's appeal if confirmed, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this — if he’s not telling the truth to Congress, then he’s not qualified to work not only in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s working on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential income in court under the Acceptable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
As part of a hearing prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would reverse some Supreme Court rulings.
"There's no time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to just say, 'Oh, that's beautiful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to govern.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of resentment, she couldn't get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues: “I was helped a lot by a woman who worked as a director somewhere, who told me that she was also crying when she was angry, but she created a certain technique, which means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: ‘Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she continued.
And I think that's great."
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office where men dominated. I once expressed my inexpressible anger crying there. But the older, always cold manager, whom I was always a little afraid, grabbed my neck and dragged me up the stairs.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an affair aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were seven other candidates and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time at the time, she could not keep up with the receipt of contributions, and so she pledged that she would not start the match unless she earned $2 million in contributions.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Does she think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally implement the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise money and focus on the electorate rather than on the delegates, and out of anger at sexism, that she was completely suffocated by anger.
"You might think I've collapsed nervously," Schroeder said of how the press reacted.
"And you might have thought that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they might write on the gravestone.
"Crying?"
Why China-U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening salvo of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and while the battle is far from over, experts say the gap between the countries will be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
However, most of the most significant escalations saw the light of day this week when new tariffs were announced for goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which practically means taxing half of the trade exports from China to the United States.
Beijing has reacted every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the $60 billion in U.S. goods imports.
China has tried to repay the U.S. with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will kneel.
While China would like Washington to return to its original tracks, it would mean giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to US demands would be utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts think that if Beijing could play its cards properly, a US trade war could positively support China in the long run, as it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The reality is that quick political decisions by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic twist in both countries. This is far more dangerous than observers have conceded so far,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia in the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria ready to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today's situation on the territory is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to normal.
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism are met, as well as unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe responds strongly to Ryder Cup victory in Paris
Team Evria won the Ryder Cup in 2018 by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost for the sixth time in a row on European soil, thus not winning the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
US star Phil Mickelson, who had troubled most of the tour, then blew the ball into the water for 3 pairs of 16 holes and conceded Francesco Molinari's victory.
Italian golfer Molinari then shined in all of his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best 5-0-0 result since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-rated player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who apparently finished his last Ryder Cup.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, the Spaniard Sergio Garcia became the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned during his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't help it today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 of the greatest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk said: “I’m proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe to the heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee.
I love these 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really have to go.
You overplayed us."
Red tide update: Concentrations decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota districts
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to an overall decline in red tide concentrations in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, spots of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The blooming water of the Red Tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern Pinellas County to the southern Lee County.
The spots were spotted about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week there were relatively fewer spots.
The red tide was also observed in the Pasco district.
Low to high concentrations were observed in the county of Hillsborough, the lowest to high concentrations in the county of Manatee, the lowest to high concentrations in the county of Sarasota, the lowest to medium concentrations in the county of Charlotte, and the lowest to high concentrations in the county of Charlotte.
Respiratory irritations continue to occur in the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
Airway irritation was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
