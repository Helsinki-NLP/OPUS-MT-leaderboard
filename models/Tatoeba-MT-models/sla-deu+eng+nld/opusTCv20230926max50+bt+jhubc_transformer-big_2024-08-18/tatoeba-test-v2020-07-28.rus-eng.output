How's the weather?
I texted her.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.

You're both idiots.
Do you like living outside the city?
How long did it take you to do that?
We finally have everything we need.

I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was shouting.
Which is better?

Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.

I didn't know exactly where to start.
That's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom made pancakes.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much does it cost?

Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.

Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I didn't sleep until after two o'clock in the morning.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard to fall asleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say the movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we were late due to heavy rain.
Looks like she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Take care of your brother.
Tom said he wasn't going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I've never betrayed you.
We've done this together before.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom wins.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're dirty.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You can't catch Tom.

If the weather permits, we'll climb to the top of the mountain tomorrow.
We both know her.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve a problem.
I could have gone to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes shone and sparkled, and his usually pale face came to life and was covered with blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Take some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was doomed to die.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Can anyone speak French here?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me get your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I love you so much, I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
Power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.

Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of battle.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do it before it gets dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom is not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife in.
What, the moustache suddenly became fashionable?
Tom said he didn't want to spend that much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate costume.
That's the truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What do these people do?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here within 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll save you.
We are proud of our achievement.
Tom should have invited Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not his girlfriend.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a taxi.
Stop hitting the cat!
What were you gonna say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is who he claims to be?
King Harald Hormsson, better known as Harald the Blue-Sucking, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
I wish Tom could stay longer.
Almost everyone was dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He wore a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You're not allowed in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom loves to read Hermann Hesse.
Truth be told, I never spoke Portuguese.

Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very sour.
Tom left Mary.
Tom knew something was wrong.
We had no idea Tom was going to do that.
Here's another day gone.
You have to do it right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He was injured when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my arm.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you keeping an eye on your weight?
Tom's playing trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I don't want her in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald’s is famous for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have an opinion?
Do you like these perfumes?
The castle is broken.
Diamond is a precious stone.
Have some cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Mary.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice encountered, waiting for an answer, was a sudden clamor. It was a loud noise, so sharp as to tear her eardrums, and so loud as to reach the heavens.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
Tom can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get her things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she had asked for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I tried in vain to solve the problem.
You had to do your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As it sounds, so it will respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana cake?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I am learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd come back.
Tom is the youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We'd like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for that.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Could you solve that question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
The building has 20 floors.
If you're not going, I'm not going either.
Do you happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any photos of Tom.
Can you wait a bit?
Are you going to give Tom something for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I will be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes that singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
What time do you plan to be home tonight?
The bag is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think we can rely on you.
She knew she was wrong.
That's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I got home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are negotiations going?
He prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom has small moustache.
Do you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't make her angry.
I'd better stay.
Tom had a brilliant idea.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this place reliable?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything is fine.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom should be going to Boston next week.
Don't walk in someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done here.
How do you feel about your new class?
Be afraid of your own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough to eat.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
I was poisoned.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
What time do you want to leave?
Her legs hurt.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to talk to you about something important for both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom swam?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do it very often.
I hope we don't do it again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dance with Mary.
By the time I get there, it'll be opening time.
I'm not sure what size she is.
He was also kind to the animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think about Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary had been adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
We were crying with him.
Would you like to try again?
Wait a little longer.
Why are you so undressed?
You can make butter, cheese and much more from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, do not forget those who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her youngest daughter.
Behave yourself.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I've smoked before.
Didn't you know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He winked back.
Tom said Mary was pleased.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll be fine if you try.
Didn't you think to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Can you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
Not a single snowflake in a snow avalanche feels guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'll solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the store open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's a one-time spit.
I really liked this book.
You're important.
When the ice melts, it turns into water.
Jane asked Mary if she would stay the night.
Tom didn't tell the cop his real name.
I went to school there.
The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I was in pain.
She strangled him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Will it hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom was deceived.
I called you here to ask a question.
Who do you play Tom with?
I need a light coat.
I've finished my assignment.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.

Stop here!
You've been very helpful.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to take his age into account.

They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?

Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use it, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance to win.
How long are you planning to stay?
We ate quickly and left immediately.
There is a large garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Careful, don't drop anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.

He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It had to be you.
Mary left her hat in my room.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I was unable to attend his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.

Machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.

The river is full of fish.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.

I don't have to put up with it.
Always give way to interference on the right.
We are asked to introduce ourselves in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you off if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing is more relaxing than a hot bath.
I really don't have much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!

You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day of work.

Get out of here!
Then what is it, I wonder? If this is not selling goods at home, then maybe this is a new way to meet girls?
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you clean up your room?
If there is no God, everything is permitted.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.

You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten your seat belts during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I turned down the offer.
You want to come with us?

It's gonna take me too long to explain why it won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build it all yourself?
I am looking forward to my summer vacation.
Can we formulate it differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily ignited.

She's a slut.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait here for him to come.
We talked about what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think this through.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.

She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight, I need to get ready for class.

I didn't see you.
You're just stating the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your fault that this happened.
It's like a clock.
I know where you're going.
You catch everything on the fly.
Let's get him up.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he's telling us.
Let me tell you what you are doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.

I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has an inherited disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is attack.
She is getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
Investigations began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's it going?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?

I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
Do you know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm getting out of hand today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
Tom was only thirty when he learned to drive.
I'm glad he wasn't hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my feather knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You're about to adjust to village life.
Keep a bucket of water nearby.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We all got along.
The river is deepest.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you this a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.

He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" - "I hope not."

Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get to the point.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes lightning strikes twice in one place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.

You decide for yourself.
Were you surprised?

Rabbits breed quickly.

Did you try to talk to Tom about it?

How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
Do you want them to help?
Tom is nowhere to be seen.
I told Tom to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruits.
Could you close the window?

Keep me posted.
You have a right to your opinion.
Mary told me she'd buy it.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two marks of forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a bike for your birthday.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
Beer is beer.
I don't think Tom's gonna like that.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
I thought you said she was yours.
Tom is busy with his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
It's extremely interesting.
Don't sit up late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody having fun?
Tom watches figure skating on TV.
We're gonna have to sleep on the street tonight.
Did Tom show Mary how to do it?
It's amazing, isn't it?
I shook my face.
The school is just a five-minute walk away.
Tom put the spoon in his pocket.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see a rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a link.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many more people know about this?
I peed.
We didn't meet in Paris.
Are there volunteers?
I told her I wasn't interested.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign this.
I felt like something was wrong.
Tom swallowed a beer.
I'll tell you what to do.
A man born in France is a Frenchman.
I'm not used to it.
It's a gift from her.
Do you have a house?
Don't feed the duck.
Hey, it's me, can you pick me up at the train station?
Now tell me something about yourself.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I am learning French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all of Mary's questions.
Tom's teaching my kids French.

Did Tom tell you where he was going?
He's not richer than me.
If only I could tell you!
She was late for the train.
In the summer I go to the sea and in the winter I go to the mountains.
I'm sorry I didn't trust you.
You know everything about me.
An elderly person lives alone.
You're so stupid.
He's almost never angry.
You're kind of tense.
I don't know how to do that.
What would make you happy?
I'll be there on Monday, Tom on Tuesday, and Mary on Wednesday.
Is it safe to eat raw eggs?
What is the height of the Empire State Building?
Hey, how are you?
Neither Tom nor Mary did anything illegal.
Unfortunately, that's true.
Can we lock this door?
I don't know what to say.
What are you all doing here?
Police arrested the robber.
Keep Tom in the dark.
I'm not going to school today.
You two come with me.
Tom drank red wine and Mary drank white.
I read the article.
It used to belong to them.
He doesn't even notice me.
He's a disgrace to the whole city.
You're up to it?
The pigeon did everything.
That's my favorite.
I don't think anyone noticed what Tom was doing.
I will not sell my soul.
It's not my house.
They should move fast.
I think you paid too much for it.
I'll take it.
I wanted to eat pizza.
She said she didn't want to sleep.
You don't have time.
You're above all of us.
I was born here.
I asked my boss to raise my salary.
Do you have any idea how much trouble you've caused?
Would you mind taking me?
Mary covered her face with her hands.
What if he's wrong?
Tom looks a little like his father.
We never talked about that.
I know what that means.
I had to act fast.
Mary said she'd do it herself.
Don't you remember how I told you all this?
These girls just want to have fun.
I spoke to the doctors in French.
Robots are used to make cars.
The punctuality of Tom was never different.
Tom and Mary are asleep.
They were all amazed to see me there.
Drink to my health!
He cut himself with a knife yesterday.
The singer suddenly switches to falsetto.
You don't have a fever.
Thank you very much for this information.
I can't afford to buy a new bike, so I'm gonna have to do this old one.
Tom doesn't think there's life on Mars.
I can't spend all day here.
I became a lawyer to help people.
I visited Dan.
I met him a few months ago.
These gloves belong to him.
She does not look more than sixty years old.
Can you trust her?
She's a talented singer.
I've done this many times.
Do not play poker with them.
Tom is very upset about something.
I'll call her right away.
I want to dedicate this song to Tom.
Tom gave me Mary's phone number.
Tom held the rope with both hands.
Tom doesn't pay any attention to Mary.
Tom lives in the same building with me.
Don’t blame others for your mistakes.
I thought Tom was coming to see us.
I never lied to her.
Tom burned his fingers against the stove.
They took her.
Mary could have done it if she had tried.
Tom asked Mary where she wanted to go for lunch.
Can I have one too?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with the lessons?
Tom likes oranges.
This is the current plan.
We want Tom to say yes.
I think about them all day.
I can't read or write.
How's Tom?
Tom left on time.
Tom stayed there for a few days.
X-rays showed that two fingers were broken.
Tom said Mary really wanted to eat.
Tom had to go there.
It was a fantastic day.
I said good night.
Try to escape.
Let's wait a little.
Laws must be observed.
Tom made Mary wait a long time.
Do you know anything about Tom?
I do it for the money.
We were just talking about you.
Excuse me, can I have a check?
I thought you'd be laughing.
Mary wore two sweaters.
You'll see Tom, you'll understand.
I want to take them to work.
I'm sure he's smart.
Which way should I go?
You were born there?
I don't have that kind of hearing anymore.
He said it was nine.
The butterfly flew.
There's no time for that.
Both of these suitcases are mine.
The prices are rising.
She's not wrong.
Today I'm finally going to tell Tom what I'm really thinking about him.
Don't be mad at me.
I knew Tom wouldn't kiss you.
Do you like to sing?
I love winter.
Show me a picture of her.
They trusted you.
He was born in America.
Tom, of course, doesn't think so.
He called me just as I was going to bed.
If I can do it, so can you.
The sun warmed his skin.
Tom promised to come back.
Tom doesn't want me to go.
