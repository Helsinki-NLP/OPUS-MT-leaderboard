Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco store
The 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the stepping stone to a local store this week.
But the victim’s brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, and adds: “He’s finally getting better.”
The body found in the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eight-year-old resident of San Francisco, Frank Galicia, a medical examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously been a line cook in Boston, had won his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters restaurant said they were "shocked and destroyed" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much,” he said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been sleeping in hostels at first, but that recently "he was finally getting better."
"He found an apartment, he dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in a fight.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an uncut diamond that shone every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion euros in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state-owned carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amount of modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, is gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways has invested more than CZK 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent was reflected in the reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
A larger share of the investment was made by the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money went, and 40 percent of the company invested in the restoration of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, the upgraded older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If modernization of vehicles were not counted, the average age of <0xC4><0x8C>D powered vehicles would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when counting upgrades.
If only the age from the date of production were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic train sets consisting of wagons and driven by a locomotive have gradually disappeared from the Czech and global railways and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive dropped from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier disposed of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
From the investments that the <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the fleet in the near future, it can be mentioned, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic fast track.
The contract envisages the collection of up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The authorities have known about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they cannot get rid of it.
We are helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year now, the editors of the online daily newspaper Aktualno.cz have been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a tourist-interesting walk in the treetops, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar advertisements all over the country.
According to officials, there is a weak law, due to which it is not possible to immediately remove illegal mobile billboards.
A complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed first.
In the meantime, however, the company changes its name and the office is short for it.
Or you just need to move the ad a few meters and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted: at the main line from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno, on our land near the state road, there is an advertising billboard in black.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of an unauthorized portable structure with a giant advertising poster.
It's as if no one cares that he's standing right next to the road, in a 50-meter security zone where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can’t deal with the billboard simply because of the law.
Maybe load him up and take him away.
"We can't just afford that," said Nina Ledvin, a spokeswoman for the Highway and Highway Directorate, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which began to be followed in detail by the online newspaper Aktualno.cz in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot effectively and quickly solve.
In South Bohemia alone, the editorial staff counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are other countries as well.
"We have difficulty forcing companies to remove the beacons," confirms Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Regional Office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sy, there is a leaky law that binds officials.
First, it is difficult for the owner of the billboard to address in order to put the advertisement away.
But CEOs are often unattainable, or they know the trick, which has already been described in the past, when the issue began to become more interested in detail: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters, and officials can throw the previous call to remove black ads in the trash.
This is because the authority has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone shifts it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they see it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa.
The new law will not help.
The change could have been brought by a new law that will ban billboards on motorways from September next year and restrict them on first-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transmitted ads will remain the same as before.
The authorities will not be relieved.
Companies can continue to make tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on rentals of illegal areas, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice magistrate is currently running three administrative proceedings for black-built billboards with it.
The company faces a three-hundred-thousand-dollar fine in every case.
These are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the protection zone of Class I road.
The proceedings have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mr<0xC3><0xA1>z, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice City Hall.
Advertising, which is currently interested in.cz, is not yet included in these cases, but it will most likely be added to them soon.
According to <0xC5><0x98>SD spokesperson Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be brought to the table by regional and then, most likely, magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those companies that can’t be contacted.
It does not take over the post office and canceled its official headquarters in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the post office of the company went to the South Bohemian businessman Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company leases and offers the area to advertisers, has rejected any link in the past.
At the same time, this spring, when the <0xC5><0x98>SD began to be interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer sent a letter to the mysterious Commerz Billboard company to his pension, where the company is allegedly newly based.
To this day, no one has contacted the highway authorities.
A futile fight.
Such silence or opaque changes of settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to do.
The executor returned the case, the ads were still standing, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It is like fighting windmills, admits one of the officials on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet addressed the amendment in this regard.
At the moment.cz spoke with several Members who were interested in the problem.
So far, however, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech roads.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also for regional and municipal politicians.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand to limit them, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I don’t have the rather well-established impression that if something doesn’t work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, according to statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s harvest is above the average for the past five to ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Grain harvests will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decimal decline compared to last year.
Last year’s crop yield was above average.
This year’s harvest is above the average for the last five to ten years.
This year, the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher.
Rape growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they received 1.256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s poppy harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decrease in cereal production is due to both a 3.7 per cent decrease in hectare yield to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and a decrease in the crop area.
This year, farmers have lost three percent of their fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in several fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed on the decline, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
About a fifth decrease is expected by statisticians for spring barley, which is most often used for the production of beer.
The reduction in crops is due to a 15.2 percent reduction in crop area, but also to a lower hectare yield.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is born by 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of rye will also increase.
The crop of rapeseed is estimated by statisticians at 1,305 million tons, which is more than last year.
In fact, the sown area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
However, the hectare yield will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while sowing on the area is a third more extensive than ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also increased.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, the field is half.
Thanks to the expansion of seed areas, this year's poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tonnes compared to last year.
However, the hectare yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police officers accused two men of assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them into custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he suffered urinary and cut injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Both suspects were arrested immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and a machete.
The attackers inflicted cuts and cuts on him, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon in a Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokesman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A mass fight between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal quarrel, two attackers attacked with a knife and a machete of a 35-year-old man.
Although the man tried to escape, he suffered urinary and cut injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokeswoman said.
The clash, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and forced several police patrols and police officers to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
The criminals of a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc have been charged with attempting to injure his health and riots.
The plaintiff filed a motion with the court to take them into custody and the court granted it on Friday, the spokesperson added.
Machete was used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle by attackers five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the discotheque Varna in Riegrova Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the company who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You’ll be surprised if you walk around them every day.
One of the most egregious examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB residence in the middle of the Senov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xBD> Square.
It should have been a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about using existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several tenement houses, which, despite their location, size and often also monumental protection, are empty and empty.
We have selected the properties in the center using the project Przednédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relations between companies, or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Let the owners pay a special tax on them, they want an initiative

Clinton’s husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
They donated more than a million dollars to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton’s income — over $6 million — is for their speeches.
Trump has refused to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, putting pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
Most of Clinton’s revenues — over $6 million — are for their speeches, mostly from before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income on taxes.
Trump, however, has a similar problem, but has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump pays no taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after the publication of his confession.
Clinton has repeatedly reverted to the secrecy surrounding Trump’s earnings, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her rival is really as rich as she claims.
Trump’s fortune is estimated at billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of the Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today published a report on his tax contributions over the past ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they donated 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and made 25.6 percent of their earnings in taxes last year.
Polio has broken out again in Nigeria.
The Islamists of Boko Haram prevented consistent vaccinations and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of polio have resurfaced.
In the north-east of the country, the government announced an emergency vaccination there, as two children infected with the disease were paralyzed.
Vaccines brought helicopters there.
Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram were active in the affected area, defending vaccinations and even killing doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated unnoticed.
In northeast Nigeria, emergency polio vaccinations will begin as two children infected with the disease are paralyzed.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday quickly delivered polio vaccines to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating in the area for many years.
Boko Haram extremists have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to get into areas where children with polio were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from the newly liberated part of Nigeria from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO’s polio eradication unit, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria would begin next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram was active for a long time.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government only at the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram was significantly weakened in this part of the country.
The Nigerian health minister, Isaac Adewole, has admitted that the new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
The WHO has warned that although the disease may not have been present for two years, it has spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all polio cases worldwide.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three areas: Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis has met 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of pimps thanks to police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an intensification of the fight against it.
Pope Francis has met 20 former prostitutes in Rome who have been freed by police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the stirring stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, they were all subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
The visit was intended to draw attention to human trafficking and to call for an intensified fight against it, the Pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is attacking jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this cannot be done.
France should be helped by the Muslims themselves in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, Prime Minister Manuel Valls’ government is preparing major changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer houses.
And others will follow, the interior minister said.
There are over 100 jihadist factories in the country.
“If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom to this religion,” Valls said.
In particular, he intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, it wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
This is also the reason why preachers who can sow radicalism in France go to mosques.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should act as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already then, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions were soon struck by internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on the magazine Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out about a new institution that would replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by other terrorist attacks in France, carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radicalized Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation will be set up this October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where the money will be taken not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
In practice, halal food vendors would pay for the certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
About 30,000 people travel to Saudi Arabia each year for the traditional pilgrimage.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only preachers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We're closing down radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is on a campaign against radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced recently.
In France, there is no place for those who preach hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams, and several dozen others are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the government’s actions can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people are radicalized on the Internet, said Severine Labatov<0xC3><0xA1>, an expert from the National Center for Scientific Research.
Dr<0xC3><0xA1>h<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> Kelemen lost in the first round of sprint with star Baugém.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for the progress to the eight-finals in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, after progressing from the sprint qualification among the top eighteen, lost in the 1st round to the French giant Grégory Baugé, the defender of silver from the previous games in London.
They have to fight for progress to the eighth-finals in corrective rides.
At the start of the Royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech tracker of the present time scored the fourteenth best time.
He scored a two-hundredth takeoff in 9,969 seconds.
In the main knockout stage, he was expected in the qualifying fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen, in the end, was touching an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the progress.
Jason Kenny, the gold defender, had a great performance.
The 28-year-old scored the third fastest two-hundredth in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record 9,551.
As expected, he easily dealt with the last advance, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4km race and advanced to the final.
The previous maximum (3:51,659), which belonged to the British four years after the Olympics in London, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of the young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Board of Young Physicians (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire board to support further industry events in early September.
The JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the treaty issues.
In July, young doctors and medical students voted to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who participated in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government remained “still silent” on the issues, leading to a rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC executive body voted to reject the proposed new treaty completely and request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, today the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing programme of intensified industry events in early September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which the BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the health minister said the deal would impose a burden on the medical community in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliance of the “Incompatible”
It was a gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of an eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxurious hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiated warmth from him, even by his measured standards.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" Mr. Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would be even better.
The next day, a local newspaper reported that Erdogan was acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that was radiating from Putin showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin was handing out wounds around him and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The scandal was all the greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media has waged a massive nationwide campaign against Ankara for months.
All of a sudden, the Turks seemed to be responsible for everything.
More serious were accusations from top officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message came that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology he asked from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost stripped of power during the failed coup last month and therefore needs all of his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact – in particular, the cancellation of charter flights, which transport several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
This number has decreased by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take a break here if flights are resumed.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural commodities from Turkey would be allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the Vedemosti newspaper reported.
However, the visit had further political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about EU membership and Putin’s accession – which he longs to be able to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him to help the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of incompatibles”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of introductory talks, both presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the bank’s chief executive, the RBS brand will be relegated to the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was relieved when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategist brands used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
There were millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sport, from the Six Nations rugby championship to Winbledom champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the head office and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more into the foreground – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
During his travels to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because we are now much more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, it has become a global brand and RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities, and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, it has prepared a profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
“The time has come for us to move on to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (which we are asking) is how do we focus on becoming a better bank for customers?”
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But along with the way we focused on customer needs rather than our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can remind these signs of rejuvenation, I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horseback Predilection led to the goal of the 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win at Newmarket brings him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory in the evening on his local track - horse Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in straight races.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time jackett champion Dettori, who had previously won on a Ghayyar horse, said, “It’s weird.”
I'm very moved because my family is here too.
I am extremely happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys reached this milestone in obstacle races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record-breaking career led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s his tactical fissure that sets him apart from the other riders.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn’t just raced on weekends and big races, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie has ridden the winners in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
He has a lively nature, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous flying jump
From flying finishes to flying jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the messenger of the British flat racing for two decades.
It was like riding a roller coaster.
A number of big-race winners, including his famous "Big Seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from taking off because of drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but showed incredible inner strength and returned in his best form to all doubters.
And it may not be the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin dismisses Sergei Ivanov, head of the presidential office
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-six-year-old Ivanov was appointed special representative for ecology and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said Putin had “released Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was given.
His place will be taken by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s deputy since 2012.
Vajno, 44, was previously a diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later became the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
During his appointment, Putin said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are followed.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to resign and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will they convince smiles?
This step completely mystified Moscow.
For a long time, Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men announced that they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles on the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
But the official claim that a man once thought of as a possible president was suddenly eager to pursue Russia’s environmental policy was met with great distrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, Putin’s comments are quoted as saying: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult post, one might even say a problematic post, for four years.
I was president for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest associates.
At one time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become Putin’s successor to the head of state after his second term, because a third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
The post was taken over by another close Putin associate, Dmitry Medvedev.
Before returning to office, Putin became prime minister just three and a half years later.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Criminal’s Thoughts, was released after hitting the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange in Los Angeles last month.
ABC and CBS, which are producing the series, announced his release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I am sorry that this has happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, details of how the character of Gibson disappears from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 45-year-old actor, who starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the Thoughts of Criminals, and over the last 12 years I have put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and, above all, the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series is expected to return to the 12th series on September 28.
In the city of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish could be sand eels left there by a water swarm.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his discovery on the Periscope Channel in the belief that someone could help him explain how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers connected the northern platform and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - so the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is therefore the first of four closures among the "platform fans", which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we are all witnessing how the construction engineers, on an impressive scale, used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extreme accuracy.
There is now a total of more than 79% of the total bridge area, concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Head of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first bridge closure is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of ground-based construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approaching viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be towed with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
The three men are "happy to be alive" after being flushed by water from their fishing boat at Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station issued an alert on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety while their boat continued uncontrollably.
"We saw their boat circling near them, and we thought the worst," said rescue boat helmsman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, a strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held on to a fight.
They were all handed over to a coastal rescue boat and taken back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had a rope for emergency shutdown, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when it was overturned.
Someone above the boys held a protective hand.
The judge refuses to solve the case because of the Deaf man's wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three lawmakers charged with getting a political hit from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then-Chief of Cabinet, Jana Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1>, a lucrative post for political concession.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
<0xC5><0xA0>najdr, Fuksa, and the Deaf made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in prison for a month.
According to the court, however, unjustifiably, and they received compensation in total of almost 2 million crowns.
The deaf man now appears in the case as a witness, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building in the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> wants to be careful and prevent possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another district in Prague.
The Queen has already acquitted Jan Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>, formerly Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1>, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka.
In this case, the Deaf man was not present.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I believe that impartiality cannot be interpreted as precluding a court if the Witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing can be judged at all, he remarked to the diary.
"I think it's gone," he added.
Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also charged in the case of political traffic.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the Prague 1 District Court heard the indictment of former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's chief of staff, Jana Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1> (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>), and others accused of misusing Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Nechasov<0xC3><0xA1> and her husband come to court.
The deaf had to deal with the statements about Peroutka.
For example, the wife of the ambassador was supposed to judge the statements of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said that he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl was apparently killed in an air raid by the Allied forces.
She and her two friends flew to Syria from London’s Gatwick Airport last February.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on the report of her death.
Young Londoners who fled their homes were reportedly smuggled into Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana are heading for another former classmate at London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year’s case drew a huge wave of attention, as well as tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that about 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand dollars.
A well-paid job that you don’t even need a college degree for.
At first glance, this is what the job of an IT man looks like.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only extremely high salary (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
It is estimated that almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the Grafton Human Resources Agency, programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists are among the most sought after.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
Therefore, it is not candidates who compete for a job, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for students.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but it often has little to do with knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most earnings are in Prague.
The wages of the Ithians are everywhere high above the republican average.
Most of the money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit.
"Wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," confirms Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
The highest earnings will be achieved by technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but even there it does not fall below CZK 80,000.
IT project managers are also in demand.
On arrival, they can earn 60 000 - 100 000 CZK.
It's also a battle for graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the employment office, this does not apply to IT students.
In fact, if companies pull over and overpay an expert from another company, they will like to reach for the graduate.
They can raise him in their own way.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is useful in any profession, but it is necessary to have at least decent English.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are especially looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied with only an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, the support worker is fluent in more foreign languages, it is of interest to his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director adds Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In Google, there's paradise.
Only Czech workers can be envious of employees at Google.
Of course, for them flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various short-term jobs, not only for moms.
“The company gives newly-baked dads four weeks of extra leave after the baby is born,” said Martina Jonekov<0xC3><0xA1>, a Google spokesperson.
Hiding also includes health care for employees and family, catering, transportation, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to be educated is green, and it doesn’t matter what they want to learn.
But the benefits do not end there.
Such a full free fridge is also definitely not to throw away.
A healthy lunch (both breakfast and dinner in some locations) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so what is not eaten, put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible benefits for Czech ratios?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, the shift or development, ideas and innovative solutions,” he said.
The UN has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "causes serious concern that Bulgaria is not complying with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to see how important and influential public figures publicly express their support for the criminal armed militias that are audaciously pursuing refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey.”
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or more - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria has detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 last year.
Pokémon Go – a quest for health and happiness that pays off
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time over screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from the sofas and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens initially shrunk on television, later on video games, and most recently on smartphones.
It is great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
I am talking, of course, about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and others were created).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
The launch in other countries was then postponed due to the massive interest that led to the overload of servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that they follow with GPS, and when they find them, they can “take a picture” (via a screenshot on the phone) or “catch”.
Mania enthralled a generation that played the game at a younger age, lifting it from its seats and driving it out to look for Pokémon.
In the USA, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the "average" person takes every day.
Apple’s Cardiogram smartwatch app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people watched who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go – it only sees rough data on the levels of the exercises.
Many public campaigns to “find 30,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have fallen on barren ground because most of the public health messages are boring and aimed at people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we cannot fully state here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while chasing Pokémon.
As is often the case, there are, of course, boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What, what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Back in the day, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they gave us no reason to do anything like this game.
The novelty is seen and the interest in it begins to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the skip.
No effort on the hammer.
In the free, they were all mute.
Excellent at everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the all-around title and beat the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlights.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and team member of the "final five" Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a helmsman appearance in the multi-fighting individual finals in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win the all-rounder, and the fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the scoreboard and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at world championships - including 10 gold medals. Her stunning line-ups are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The final test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be seen as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning the gold and silver medals in the women's all-around final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was a exclamation point in the celebration of the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that she has never looked ahead during her long journey to the summit, but that is not entirely true.
Part of her line-up - the one that contains her typical triple flip-flops - is set in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of trainer Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
She hasn’t lost a multi-fighting competition since the summer of 2013 — a succession of victories that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the short lead with two turns, it was just an illusion.
Kladino and the commoners - where Biles defends the World Cup - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points per hammer - and ended up with 15,933 points in the draw.
Raisman hugged her gently as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, tears appeared as the wish she had written down in her diary came true.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a retaliation for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared third place with Mustafin, but then she ate bronze because of the sum of the three best teams.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call “grandmother”, was quite ahead.
She sent air kisses after her maids, overcome by a return that at times seemed insecure.
For Bilesov<0xC3><0xA1>, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most important attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
According to the report, the armed man was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from a handgun, then escaped in another vehicle.
According to police, the triple homicide was not worth the theft because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with her.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said investigators are investigating whether the shooting had anything to do with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place in four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which targeted an empty van just half an hour before the triple homicide. The police believe that the serial killer was the cause.
Investigators found the casings and assembled a bullet from the remains of bullets in the seat and under the engine hood.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know about during pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I thought I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not at all true - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never recognize them and might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people didn’t do that anymore,” Picciuto said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit or crawl, and he still couldn't speak.
However, some milestones are slowly being met.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth performs a sign speech by which Edmund says "please sing to me."
"We're teaching him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - it says that Edmund invented some of the characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciuto reminds us of the emotional tax that an uncertain future sets for itself.
I keep asking, “What’s next?”
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me.
But Picciuto has an encouraging message for mothers of all children suffering from birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is getting better.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods required rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and extensive flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) has reported that after extreme rainfall, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and are threatened with widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for waterborne vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the Tangipahoa district asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most southern Louisiana working until Saturday.
The weather service said in a statement that another 8 to 13 centimetres could rain over the sea.
In southern Alabama, a flood patrol was on standby on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs are predicted to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He went on to say that the danger is current-flow floods in Ascension district, when these dilute streams will pour into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest recorded local time on Friday morning at 9 a.m.
Rescue workers are still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson County in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among the survivors of Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his other step-son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it all the way up to my waist.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever experienced on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and took them to the Gloucester Fire Station, where they remained covered on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, floods “spread quickly” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Levinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil had been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elder from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets trapped by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond shelters were established for those who were evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts dropping," he said.
In the district of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed due to the flood, and locals were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major floods we had here were in March," said Lacy Landrum, the city's administrator.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, crisis manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said it was raining hard on the Gulf Coast.
He said several houses were reported to have been flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) – “Boy Shot Like a Rifle” Survives Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a six-year-old boy has been shot dead in Philadelphia, the second shooting this week on a six-year-old in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahay Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including groin, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when transported to the hospital.
"He's got a lot going on, his little body's been shot up," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and underwent several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people shot in Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men, aged 29, is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, the other two victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely to be a shootout between several armed men.
On the spot, shells were found from assault-type weapons belonging to various assault-type weapons.
It was definitely a continuing battle.
There were shells on either side of the sidewalk.
So it seems that there were several armed combatants who were actively involved," police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray shot Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women’s gymnastics team for this year’s Olympic Games, and for several reasons.
First of all, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of black and Latina women at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years has been an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were in first and second place last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth U.S. woman to win gold in a women's singles multiplayer.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same journey as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five” because the gymnastics team for the next Olympic Games will consist of only four female athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport, and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, trips, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their fiancees and families). And this is not all.
Most of these sports clubs are in wealthy areas of the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs gymnasts have all the trainings and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics trainings that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 young people within the city (especially black and Hispanic) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating your “girl power” and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on the journey of becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, young doctors are ready to go on strike
The ministers hoped that a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would bring an end to disagreements over the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt revealed plans in July to enforce the contract, saying the NHS was in “Nobody’s Land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA’s Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current workforce crisis and therefore fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under the new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time runs out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with reluctance to involve Dr. and often with deafening silence from the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for enforcement, and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called in to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA), disagreements will be concluded regarding the changes.
The BMA wants higher pay for work over the weekend for the 54,000 young doctors who would be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “There will be little or nothing to be achieved by the field action, but there will be pressure on already overloaded teams and services, and there will be increased fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have discussed with the board of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervision and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive engagement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and gender pay gap - was evidence of how serious employers, Healthland Education and health care were.
The drug for 60 crowns a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer time.
The blood clotting medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of having a seizure again in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other seizure.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer breaks off, a blood clot may form, block the access of blood to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot is released, it can continue through the bloodstream, block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the brand name Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely to occur.
The draft NICE Directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the patient’s quality of life.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited beyond three years, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year because of corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to overlooking the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report.
Ex-Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes police, election inspectors and city halls for ignoring voter abuses because of “oversensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect alert voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are during the elections.
At the moment, voters only need to state their name and address.
In addition, the report proposes to apply indelible ink on the fingers of people when giving their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for the press to have greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against election fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the broader corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
Downing Street has called for the news as a result of an election scandal at Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be removed from his post following allegations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically affected" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman said, “He campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives in to someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote - which is alleged to have pressured older members of the Muslim community during it to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document.
“Evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that ... state institutions were closing their eyes to such behavior because of a ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes and preventing “vote exploitation.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and levy fraud.
Consider the possibility of requiring voters to present an identity document before voting.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating ballots and ballots.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
To change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who exert unlawful pressure under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos in polling stations.
Require only Englishmen (except Wales) to work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it is “surprising” that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Electoral Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
It also criticises the futile “check-box checks” in the town hall’s voter registration departments.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s judgment in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has the proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten that reputation.
Duchess Kate and other famous doubles at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics have gone crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is by no means the only gold-winning athlete this year to boast her own celebrity double — at least not according to social media.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women’s Column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to the double Kate on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his images appeared, which are strikingly similar to the wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had heard about his resemblance to Leo from a young age.
"He doesn't see much resemblance to himself, except perhaps his beard," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a dude and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafin, with her large, distinctive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the film The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-standing comparison is that of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same brown skin and blonde hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say that he looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar facial and eye shapes
More than one: Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed similarities
On the Waves of Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed her satisfaction with the fact that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile that seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Brass Union, the star of the film!
CBC Olympic commentator apologises for saying she “exploded” a Chinese swimmer
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games on the CBC station were outraged by the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhanov<0xC3><0xA1> by commentator Byron MacDonald.
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer was “smelling” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when, at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final, he began to spew his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring a “rebound” to the CBC comment team, said: “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Too much excitement, she stretched like a stink, she exploded.
Oh, thanks.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the race's second relay in a time of 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadian women to reach China.
Viewers in Canada began to quickly respond online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC announce that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘exploded’?”
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's relay race in the 4x200 meters freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald’s criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many demanded his dismissal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted CBC, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the swimmer's performance that leaked into the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, and we're sorry it happened."
CBC apologises more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to comments
Scott Russel has apologized on MacDonald's behalf.
CBC then copied and inserted their apology into a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and released a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she should not have gone into the air.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who follow us on social media.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remarks by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I meant the swimmer's performance and not the swimmer's person as such."
"There's no need to say that I didn't intend to do anything disrespectful, and I'm very sorry."
Primark customers are offended by a woman who shamelessly tried underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try her panties on the sales floor in the middle of the Primark, shoppers were unsure of which direction to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, undressed her panties, and returned them to the shelf.
She continued to browse and finally tried four pairs of panties in a store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark shop in Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said the mysterious woman had “dressed up again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, as bold as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her taking her panties off again, and she obviously didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same thing with three others before she finally decided she didn't like anything, dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to care at all who was watching - nor did she think of the man who might be buying the panties she was trying on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and nobody cleaned them is disgusting.”
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "When she left, I was collecting things she obviously tried to pull from the sale - which is also the only right thing to do."
"I'd be terrified to bring home my new panties and find that another woman was wearing them, taking them off and not washing them."
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against a weapon attack with Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the Grand Master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation, to figure out how to deal with armed burglars at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain superiority over a rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the rear.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free shot.”
Then you grab a gun between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with your free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the groin, and while the assailant is twisting in pain, you twist the weapon out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and start to retreat, while holding the weapon pointing at him.
If an armed man is approaching you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body from the firing line, grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip and start retreating, still aiming at it.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the robbery - unless you're the Grand Master of Krav Maga - is to give out all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a severe test of his immune system and choking reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, a Suffolk-born travel writer and moderator, licked a euro banknote, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet and a Russian public phone with his tongue as proof of the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us all what he was doing.
The experiment on which Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was based, however, yielded interesting results.
The idea of licking the flush button on the train, used by thousands of other people, may seem completely repulsive, but there are actually a lot more harmful bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and health professionals about strengthening gut flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left anything worse in his mouth than a taste.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system completely safely - from public railings at train stations to the flushing unit
In the film he made, he says: “I haven’t taken much care of my health since childhood, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he certainly confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But one public toilet in Russia refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, he said, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the bathroom."
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something to keep an eye on and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a broader context – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy bowels is a worldwide phenomenon, and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds, "Let's just say Ian would lose my respect if he licked something I wanted him to - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to lick, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve made some of the dirty stuff.”
In 2015, Valio conducted a survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent of respondents said they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of the socially needy before eviction destroyed a municipal building in the town of Saltash in Cornwall
The family left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage to their community home after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their forced eviction from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked to find that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the flooring was torn, rubbish rolled all over the floor, and the walls were paved.
The family has already moved and is considered to be living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, head of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the house would be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, because this property will probably come to consciousness as a “not so nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and their names are notorious.
The couple have three sons who have occasionally stayed in the house, and police said the family’s horrific actions included street battles using baseball bats, intimidating nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, quarrels, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was listed on the lease, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, odorous garbage was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street, and regular people call the police.
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner forcibly from the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to evict voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the eviction with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anyone at all."
We've lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, it can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood supervisor, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys were lying in the overgrown part of the village house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and for the behavior of her family, and moving out is always the last step Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complicated case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to frighten her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate unsocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons of the tenant, who lived in the house at different times, were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove piles of rubbish that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of a class B drug she wanted to sell.
She claimed the money was earmarked for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth after eviction.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of the Denova and Cornwall police said the eviction was sending a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow this behavior," she said.
The Denova and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal are terrified after a low-flying military jet over the beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun in Portugal’s Aveiro were scared to death
Portugal’s P-3C Orion Air Force Flying Incredibly Low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to safety.
As the low-flying jet crashed over the crowded beach, panic engulfed the frightened tourists.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting close to the sun on a sandy beach near Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Tourists began to rise after being disturbed by the noise of jet aircraft engines, not seeing what would emerge from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the town of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyover on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds, “I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists at the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify a fishing boat off the coast and had to endure low because it was the only way to check the boat.
The aircraft reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires, but the air force insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats as part of the training.
Half of funeral services don't follow the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services, according to her, most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
The COI imposed 41 fines for this in the total amount of 73,000 crowns.
Her spokesman, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fröhlich, informed about this today.
Inspectors found errors in 47 out of 95 inspections.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially uncertified measuring instrument.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7,077 crowns.
This concerned the packaging of urns, candle covers and vases which were not duly marked with mandatory information.
“Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific service area, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year,” Fröhlich added.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join IS, died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Syria’s Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was probably killed during a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a bastion of the group in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
"One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to the war zone - is to discourage people from ever making a decision," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that they had married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months they were widowed.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he believes Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, although President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the person to replace the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with a certain degree of credibility."
Reid’s spokeswoman later said he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to “break the ship” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland’s appointment are “handmaids” and “jumpers” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, nude calendars are for “women and men”
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing celebrities, they are trying to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine full of nudity is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We have to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and let themselves be inspired by photographs of a woman’s body,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl is loved by middle-aged single men.
Before you decide to overwhelm the comments section with peppery notes under the pseudonym Not AllLonelyMaleMiddle Age, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of gramophone records is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to admire the originality of owning a physical object, but with the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought the album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about accumulating an enthusiastic fan – all of this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings alive (56% vs. 53%) and like to be alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were broadcast as a TV report, I would be watched by a camera as I walk into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gestured broadly. Then I would stop, put out my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at it."
Let's take a look at it.
While his charm and charm are slowly disappearing from Soho’s heart – once occupied by independent vendors, buildings are now filled with hotels, restaurants and canteens, outfits and office supplies – several fantastic specialty record stores remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while, and I'm going to stand next to different men in these stores and try to see what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart, 55, a native of Glasgow whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and looks through the shops to fill a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by e-mail, I did not follow him all the way home).
He also has this huge number of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy gramophone records he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he buys back what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a window.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 1960s and early 1970s. These are things that would be published when I was 11 or 12 years old at the time, I was too small and could not buy them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts who like to have company with themselves, and he adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that many of the customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people influenced by the media wave, people who had heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people most often disposed of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their turntables,” he says.
This could explain the boom of turntable lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of turntables?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a pleasant community of people with a similar mindset in music stores.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly offended by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of turntables may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and opted for the familiar environment of turntable packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, I'm a collector, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It's an easy way to fill a spot in your head.
“We’re all like their social workers!” says a co-worker from a pile of turntables.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier hadn’t listened to it yet.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not.
At this point in the reportage, he must have seemed seriously concerned as he walked through the pile of compilations of bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophies" and the revival of interest is something Jonny (42), who works at Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It's more about the product page than the music.
People come to us who say, “I don’t have a turntable.”
These are the younger people, not the older ones, the grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost one floor is currently reserved for turntables, has more diverse visitors when I come.
There are couples of seventies, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as it used to be in stores – from speakers, instead of towing jazz, the latest pop from Wild Beasts is full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it’s hard to guess an intrusive mental trauma when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks around Fopp for a few minutes and looks at various turntables at a discount.
She's one of those people who looks at the windows rather than spends a lot of money.
According to his words, he does not earn much, so it does not seem to be possible to collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but gramophone records have their charm... "he sighs eagerly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is a shop that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in the calves of girls in tight jeans and I watch a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is covered by the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of records.
No one is looking at them - maybe just because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that you can't reach them.
It's a purely vinyl trick.
But because any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for more, there’s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most luxurious goods, such as vinyl, are spent.
But while in my findings, YouGov’s results seem to be accurate — at least in record stores, at least, they don’t take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through the recordings and avoiding looking at a strange, 30-year-old fake TV presenter hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - video
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measuring five meters.
French Court Refuses to Destroy Shops in Jungle Camp
A court in France has rejected an order by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in temporary restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic meals for several euros.
The prefect's office in Calais argued that the seats should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that pays no taxes and because they represent a fire risk and a health risk.
Humanitarian organizations in court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-backed associations and other groups do not provide a food supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Disputed provisory shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 temporary businesses, but said Calais' objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much bigger role than just serving food to people who "live in extremely desperate conditions."
He said the premises provided quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition was a cafe in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, operated by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying the closure of the cafe "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Aid Refugess and L’Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - the most so far in all time.
He thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> raises himself and volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
"From March I was able to train normally," he reported at the start of the summer training in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems.
Because when I was at the Universiade in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So it's a long flight to Asia that's causing trouble?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found me anything.
Then the clot got up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when the work is done or the weather is changing.
But nothing that limits me, it's more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I vomited blood tonight.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely finished for five more days.
I really thought I was dead in the Woodhouses, my girlfriend and my family.
I've seen myself somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going to go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I go somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Only when I wanted to go back to P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>brami preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off. Physically, I'm better than I was before.
What do you expect from <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
I'm looking forward to it, the team looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
I hope we sit down humanly to make it work for us.
Will you lift the mouth?
It had a reputation as a snitch, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was the eighth, now it is the second.
There's a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, only a few players left.
It was the last one in the extraleague, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first rounds who's going to be the kicker, we probably won't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last one.
But my coming wasn't his, I made a deal early.
There were other coaches in the game, I was a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say my name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has been training for many decades, he is a former good player.
He'll move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a foreigner, an Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What's he look like?
I happen to know him, at the Universiade we played against each other in a group.
And we talked there a couple of times, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other as friends.
We beat them 3-1, I immediately poured it on him at the start of the summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm the recorder, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he was, I found him playing on the Internet, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joker, he fits in with us.
How do you look forward to the record number one position?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm gonna be twenty-four, and I don't have the guts to take turns.
I'd rather be at the center of it than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I were to be like a second recorder and do it full-time. When something isn't done to its fullest, it sucks.
How many times have you been number one?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when Kust couldn't do it as a captain, he got hurt, then there were money problems and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, where I was raised, I alternated between one and two.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had many offers and chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short positioner remains the Phelps domain.
"Being on the podium again and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother cheered again in the auditorium, and this time Boomer's son slept peacefully with headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing swimming and in a few hours it will be over, he said touchingly.
In the final behind Phelps almost two seconds behind the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long position.
Bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Championships.
After Al Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distant), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by fellow American Ryan Lochte and domestic Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defender in the final crow's fifties put on a crushing finish, they fell out of medal positions.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the ceremonial proclamation of the position, he advanced to the final of the race on 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not even be overshadowed by fellow countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the iconic double - he won the double track in Rio after a hundred.
In the final, he left behind 37 hundred Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkina, the third finished Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While last year’s World Championships saw Murphy take only fifth place out of 200, he became the King of the Knights in Rio.
He dethroned Larkin, who had the same double at last year's World Championships.
He only won a medal at the Olympics.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakov<0xC3><0xA1> and American Simone Manuela shared the gold on the crullary table.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela the second after the silver relay.
She won swimming gold at the Olympic Games as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
“This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get to where I am,” Manuel said.
Third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100m butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has the silver from the two-hundredth of the kraular.
Australia's Cate Campbell finished sixth in the world record.
Japan's Rie Kanet won the 200th breaststroke, for which she won her first Olympic medal at the age of 27.
It has no precious metal from the World Championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia’s Yulia Yefimova, who, due to the start at the games despite the doping past, is struggling with the hostility of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should keep answering those questions.
“I’m tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was enforced only by a special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them go to the arbitration court, she added.
Disappointment, we could have won.
And the start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Less than an hour before the game, they knew who they were going to fight.
They had to make tactical preparations in a flash.
And then, in an unconventional time, they started the game on little court number one.
The first set did not start well, then they finished ahead of the opponents, but in 19:19 they did not manage the final.
In the second, they were clearly better and even, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, a number of failed services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
'We could have beaten the Russians, 'said Hermann.
How would you rate the match?
Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1>: After an unfortunate start, before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, I lost the income I had become accustomed to in the last balloon.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we stepped on them with an overview on the pitch, with a different defense, and we pushed them to the service.
There was a lot of bad stuff in the tie-break, and that's where we went down this page.
It was disappointing because we could have beaten the Russians.
Too bad about the first set, we missed it.
We were able to pull it back, but we were missing the dots.
The second set was great and in the third set the service decided.
We've made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and by the five it was, we hesitated a lot.
It's a pity, because the Russians were playable.
How'd you play at little mansion number one?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Similar to China in the side yards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
It was one hour at night, complete silence, music was playing, nothing.
That was the difference from the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1>: She was strange.
We started training for the match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t make tactical preparations like for the other teams.
But Simon (trainer Nausch) prepared the tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember ever starting a game at midnight?
Herman: Probably not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:00.

Beach volleyball players Markéta Slukov<0xC3><0xA1> and Barbora Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1> hugging in front of the play-offs at the Olympics in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Having played the last two games in a group of ten, we had a regime shifted earlier.
That was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine any other sport having athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we did the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it’s not typical and probably not my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1>: Since progress from the group was our goal, on the one hand it is fine, good.
We did what we said.
But now after the game, I'm sad.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: I will sleep from it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first surveillance SIM is coming.
You can't escape her.
The new rules will apply to all people without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from a local operator while in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary General of the Office of National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, informed that there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs exclusively to foreigners was unveiled by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The new measures, which will allow the monitoring of their location, are planned to be introduced by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasith, this is a means to preserve national security, which will allow to solve the crime committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs are intended to help detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Within six months, a special SIM for foreigners should be available to retailers alongside the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature is not for Thais, because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, subscriptions are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
There are currently mandatory SIM registrations, but legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply an obligation for foreigners to acquire a local SIM operator when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short for them.
Operators of a country know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging the SIM into their network.
So they know the phone number, but not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices from the rates of local operators is so dismal that even most tourists will start looking for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have received immediate criticism from foreigners residing in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and compares the forthcoming system with the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents in connection with the protection of privacy.
In addition, the police will need a court order if they need to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be punishable by an unspecified penalty.
“If the service provider tracks the location of the SIM without a court order, it will be charged with a crime,” Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently being recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM did not log on to the network, the new number could be restored after 15 days if Thailand leaves.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and jacuzzi on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care of the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was sufficient parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older buildings.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with swinging the floor, high energy intensity and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern flat.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and her colleague Kamila Pol<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Artiga studio.
Why did you address them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to harmonize the interior accordingly.
We worked with architect Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation of another client, and considering that everything worked well, it was also a clear choice for us when reconstructing our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with adequate facilities for a four-member family conceived as a modern, but not cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize intelligent household control.
And, of course, the quality of execution had to be respected.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design and showed some interior elements that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mostly Czech authors, including the works of Karel Mali<0xC4><0x8D>, Karel Vysu<0xC5><0xA1>il, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav <0xC5><0xA0>p<0xC3><0xA1>la or Otto Gutfreund, that helped the architect navigate our taste.
The combination of black, white and walnut wood was also the idea of the architect, as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then checked together using visualizations.
Were there any complications during the implementation, which forced you to give up the original ideas or, on the contrary, to start new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible for the first time to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned actually shade the surrounding buildings.
Then we changed the layout literally overnight from the ground up.
Granite was used on the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented with leather, for example on upholstery of dining and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make some changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that this is a modern airy interior, which primarily fulfills its purpose.
Changes are not planned, most of the modifications after the move-in took place in the level of the shading and accommodation of the terraces.
Perhaps the only complaint is to the floor, when the walnut wood turns out to be too delicate for the household with the dog.
The word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and MgA. Kamila Hornychov<0xC3><0xA1>, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the construction.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light pipes in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight to the darker areas of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim woman living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, not far from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, and then I got to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
I think every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but it has gotten worse recently.
It’s interesting that you’re talking about negativity.
This is how some people view the Czech character.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not feel this way when they come to France, because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
A big topic is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, on the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through his fingers just because I was Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I admit that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t capture any negative reactions or insults, but I feel that there are more free people here.
That I could do anything, dress any way, and no one would judge me.
In France, someone always looks at you unpleasantly, for example, when you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think people care about that kind of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working for Air France, I worked for a travel website.
Then one of my friends and I started a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
We are currently operating only in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends who are half Czechs and two other friends of Czech.
I must say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at first they keep more distance.
They won't let anyone near their body right away.
This is quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on their faces.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural thing, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate in English at least a little, I don’t have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you experienced any negative reactions?
Maybe because you are a Muslim?
No, not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My leader, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not French, they are Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone had a problem with being a Muslim hasn't happened to me yet.
Even though a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the mall, that they would curse me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, anything can happen anywhere these days.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel about terrorists defending their faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence very much, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at the Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>ho z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady Square.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they studied Islam in school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you see it?
I don't feel inferior in any way.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
This also means that you don’t wear a head covering.
A hijab, for example?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a true Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn’t wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It all depends on how you interpret it.
When a person reads the Quran, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I thought, “I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?”
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where scarves are required, I take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I haven't felt so good anywhere else.
I have been thinking about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims, together with Christians, demonstrated against violence.
Kozelska Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1>, a sailor, was blown to the ground by the wind in Rio.
Friday sea trips in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were made by Czech yachtsman Veronica Kozelska Fencl.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to 10th place ahead of the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech Republic's participation in the final race.
You collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
Behind the idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of parcels is TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, they breathed life into three applications with different geographical ranges.
We launched our national application in May.
There are thousands of cities in it at the moment, and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first before we focus more on abroad, says the 41-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Przejez application work and who can benefit from it?
Download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and data, how big the package you can transport and how much you want for it.
Someone might be asking for a ride that day.
When the route and delivery time match, it pairs up and both receive mutual notifications.
At that moment, the chat will open, where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I do not know the ideal state, I can not estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to cover completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
It is already working on the main tracks and it is logically easier than, for example, on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust and discovering that no one escapes with the package.
You haven't had to solve a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have after two months of launch?
Right now, we have about 5,000 to 6,000 people making roads.
We consider this a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Is it possible that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
Here you will pay a hundred or less, because this is the path that someone is already taking.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope so.
The market has huge potential, it feeds huge multinational carriers, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they pay for.
No one wants to find cards in the mailbox with a message that they should pick up the package at the branch, first the day after 7:00 p.m.
At that time, I needed the package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not bother anyone and sends a signal to the competition, let them try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a TV director.
In 2014, they began preparing Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned trips between the world's metropolises, mainly by plane, to transport packages.
In 2015, they submitted a project for processing the company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming took three quarters of the year and the application was launched in March 2016.
They started developing the P<0xC5><0x99>eve<0xC5><0xBE> app in December last year and released it in May this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The app has been developed by Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem and Mes<0xC3><0xAD>kem Profi since January this year and was made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications that one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you worried about acting in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the border of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not the intention to circumvent tax authorities and tax inspections.
Every user, whether on one side or on the other, will be encouraged to tax their income if they make a profit from it.
What makes you think the service has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, respectively, reduces the cost of travel.
This is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networking that divides people, we would like to see these networks converge.
They can make nice stories, people are happy to help someone and they will tell about it.
Maybe someone will bring you your forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, in my opinion, have been lacking in personal access for a long time, we say that this application is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package will not run away?
Each user of the application, along with registration, scans the ID card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are the channels that give the service and the person credibility.
Couriers also collect stars based on sender ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we are still adjusting the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not assume liability under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If the police stop him and find a machine gun or 10 kilos of hashish in his suitcase, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
Registered persons are, if necessary, traceable by the administrative authority, which as the only one will have the opportunity to look into it, and we ourselves are not able to see them, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money will the courier receive after the shipment has been successfully delivered to the hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he asks for.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for mediating the contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push on the volume.
The courier can also not accuse that he did not deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transport anything.
We have three sizes, small as a butter cube, medium as a plateau of eggs, and large as a bass beer.
After that, there is no more restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they can take the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the app, so that the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even need to pack it unless you want to hide the content.
You put a forgotten hoodie in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, when I did not pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach, which is aimed mainly at passengers by plane.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year it took development before we founded Shippansee LTD in London for more credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version that you are focusing on.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to feedback from customers and we do not currently deal with the foreign market as much.
We know it’s a long run, but we don’t want to, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were in a way upgraded.
The transfer occurred when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the moon is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as I do, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator on your mobile phone.
Applications for couriers who want to feed on this, we called Mess<0xC3><0xAD>k Profi.
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up packages around town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded in Prague by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Now that they're all messing with the Pokémon, they can pick this up exactly the same way.
One sees where there are orders in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and takes the shipment.
It is set up cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are also creating a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send parcels, fill in data about them on the website, or create points on the map.
We are able to invoice them every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It exhausts us, but we have it normally at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
There is no strong transnational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped in with other ideas and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage not the Czech market with us, but who should go with us into the global product and become another huge player in the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The Titanfall 2 storyline is about a nearly forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be, according to the first information, more colorful than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling should be based on the concept of networking in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to the freedom of movement, which, in addition to running, includes the possibility of using a combat titan.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on agile movement.
They will resemble platforms and include puzzles.
To overcome them, for example, double jumps, running on walls and rope slide are essential.
In addition, it will sometimes be necessary to eliminate enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and slide platforms and close massive doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're gonna play pawn Jack Cooper dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the beginning of the campaign, Cooper, along with Captain Lastimos, crashes on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no savagery to him.
Lastimosa also suffers fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper is tasked with launching the captain's titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot would come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the batteries necessary for the repair of the robot.
Cooper's calls with the titan will also be significant.
Players will use it as a source of information about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, humorous moments will arise through robot-isolated communication.
For example, when titanium will dry up, it will list all the injuries that Cooper is threatened with during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be assessed in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original label remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changed its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the THQ publishing house in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and company name.
For example, Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, 13 of which the company has not yet revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I was retiring, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty years younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - she had obviously tried for a long time at first, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she walked with the same kind in front of me.
She's gone mad at him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girlish, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched the whole thing.
He went to work regularly at half past three, so she always left at three to shop.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times have I known they were there?
I got my keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always stayed home.
I've never been able to go in there, take that decisive step.
You may be laughing at me, but I believe my wife controlled me mentally.
She soon found out that I was manageable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a nerd.
At the time, the neighbors told me they knew it too.
I was such a jerk that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all cracked, it'd be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I've always put it off, on and on.
One day, I went to his apartment to ask for help in the laundry room.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting with my wife, and that he was indicative of everything.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugged, stared at the ground, not saying a word.
Then one day I met his wife on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn’t respond and didn’t tell me either.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never been anywhere, who has trouble meeting someone, let alone finding a woman.
I didn’t even think about divorce.
I was still counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I've never really dealt with it.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end I let it go for the sake of peace.
He's still living in the next house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more of my wife than my housekeeper.
At home, she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's busy.
She always tried to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's nice too.
But sometimes I'd like to stroke her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
She once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she loves him to this day, she's her god.
And I'm sick of this kind of life.
Even when it started and I was very bad at it, I once told her that I didn’t want to live and I asked her what she would say if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
“If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee the freedom of their religion,” Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritually educated people in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, where preachers often come with money inoculated with jihad.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to set up a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim residents.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, founded in 2005 by then-Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
At that time, it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon she was struck by internal contradictions, and therefore never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by former Interior and Defence Minister Jean-Pierre Chev<0xC3><0xA8>nement, who is known as a secularist state champion.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen more are considering this step.
This week, German police also intervened against jihadist clerics.
The Imams allegedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated an area where believers were allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this was accelerated by other terrorist attacks carried out in the name of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources, as well as to oversee the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funds will be obtained, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, that is, primarily for meat derived from slaughters according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food vendors for granting permits.
Part of the money would then go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, in French mosques, only preachers who have undergone educational programs at the local universities should work.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
“We have closed 20 of them since December and more will follow,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who preach hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman at a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain, on Friday morning.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for a man in critical condition.
The crime took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably an unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Rolls with asparagus, wakame algae, ginger and chilli sauce.
Summer wishes for light, well-digested meals, but we Czechs are rebellious and have our own tastes and our own head.
And so from the summer gardens smells of grilled necks, buffalo, pork knuckles.
Not too healthy, not too light, sometimes with the exception of salad or toasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dishes, moreover, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good delicacies, which special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook anything for a long time, bake, fry or suffocate.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a couple of well-adopted griffs are enough to make the preparation fun and food itself a real exotic delicacy.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
This even eliminates the time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be softened in water for a moment, and then it only depends on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
It's not an algae like an algae.
The advantage of a variety of Asian dishes today is that the raw materials are usually already available.
Including pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but true pink gari ginger has a unique spicy sharp and at the same time delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed with several types of vinegar and ginger.
It is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures to serve and decorate dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very common in many countries in Asia and South America as a "helper" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried dishes, which are packaged in them similarly to aluminum.
The banana leaf also conveys a specific flavor to the dish.
They can be bought in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves that are richly green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from algae wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially the alga nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by chopping, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - i.e. sheets intended for the manufacture of sushi.
Wakame, a dark green algae that grows in the waters around Hokkaido Island, also eats fresh and dried algae and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women used it from ancient times to recover from childbirth.
And in general, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame is also used as a spice, for example to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to hatch in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
They are then cooled in icy water, cut out the central ribs and then rearranged, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, to buy it already finished, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So it remains only to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomb.
If you resist and don't throw in an extra grilled barrel.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh food that deliciously combines tastes.
And it's done once or twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of lettuce cucumber, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a teaspoon of black sesame, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First we prepare the rolls.
Soak the rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we cut it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, briefly boil asparagus shoots in hot water, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into ice water so that they do not lose their color.
Put the vegetable filling on the allowed paper and wrap it.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and cucumbers, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
Place asparagus shoots on the banana leaf, add the coils and finish the whole dish with wakame algae, pickled ginger, a slice of mango, sprinkle with black sesame and add a few pine nuts.
Britain has to settle for silver in seven-point rugby, Fiji picks gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in seven-point rugby ended in a devastating footsteps on the last hurdle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijanis have demonstrated a masterful lesson in processing, landfilling, evasion, supportive play, rope running and brutal forces - and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unbeatable prize of consolation in the form of a silver medal – for Britain the third of the day – and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-piece rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A 7-5 win over the South Africans in the semi-finals the same day, she may have froze in the final.
However, Fiji in its form would also beat the 15-member team in full health.
It will probably not be a consolation for the British, but they can rejoice that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has come a long way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the penetration of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other teammates, it was like running behind a number of buses on the move, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Oseo Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes, and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12-0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring a third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute he threw Jasa Veremalua touchdown in the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one upon his return, and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Rava then penetrated the naughty Brits and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29-0, there was a break.
It was like Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's the way it is.
After half-time, the British made massive changes and stopped the Fiji attack... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji, Josua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw a touchdown in the left corner to raise an an 36:7. But the match was long ago won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans at the marches sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the utterly joyful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame sweetened the Fiji victory by another attempt.
A whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and the British fell down on the lawn completely beaten.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and the UK beat South Africa in the close semi-finals - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown led the South Africans in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
The great late landfill of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's fifteenth team, secured the victory - and finally the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired by coach's fight against cancer
You won’t find more emotional gold on these Games – and that’s what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during the 220 punitive exhalations into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two of them, there were three voices in the boat. As the ship whistled across the surface towards the second Olympic gold in the women's doubles race, the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams was still with them in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sports to achieve such a result.
Their advantage was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained undefeated.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying across the water with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
For every gold medal in rowing, there's a battalion of auxiliary hands that make a difference piece by piece, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would live to see the day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this surgery.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
This will somewhat change your view of the matter.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that they could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the downtime to a minimum - if we can call it that in such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital walking around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing itself is a journey, but this was a bit more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to cope with his own anxiety.
Stanning, captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, which is on a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was emotionally down, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I worked together, and Robin did too.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
“Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so he owes a huge thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair put on a staggering rhythm that their rivals could not cope with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We concentrated as much as possible at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to achieve something famous.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to row well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her future husband is Steve Backshall, a television adventurer.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says taxi-hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to a groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate official in Prague are indicted, the <0xC4><0x8C>T said.
You have filmed a series of reports in which you have exposed fraudulent practices even of those who are supposed to be in the group that is going to stand trial.
You've faced several unpleasant fights with exposed actors because of this.
How much is the report on the indictment of members of the organized group groundbreaking for you?
I thought there might be some kind of trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they will drive all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you do not see the punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one makes a ping-pong, another distributes a pizza, and one completely gives up on it.
The defendants could theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is the right rate?
In general, I have a problem with imprisonment.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should bring back the company they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have done this by destroying our country’s name and by stealing people.
So let's get them a good business card and get people out for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a public service.
As someone goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll end up on parole and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and then at the Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bata University in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
They are among the people who started viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now preparing the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises those in the form of short reports on which services to avoid in Prague and which he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed series with the titles How to, City of Fraud?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
They are referred to in the indictment as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called a mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the Godfather.
It's more about the mafia - juniors, but they're organized for sure.
The only thing is that they are guarding each other's poles (taxi stations).
Prague is completely dispersed.
I found out that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> (disco club)
Everyone just keeps their place and each group is somehow organized.
It's probably a complicated network.
Only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former municipal official, who warned the driver of the crash, were indicted.
As you yourself say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
What is the percentage of taxi fraudsters in Prague, according to your estimation?
That's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still there.
I am talking, for example, about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryj<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by the Charles Bridge and carries people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were selected.
The same is true in other locations in Prague.
With the indictment of seven people, it is therefore difficult to eradicate the already famous Prague n<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>var, which seems to have a much larger dimension.
Of course, it's useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be eradicated, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places that you showed in the reports, i.e. at Charles Bridge or at Parizska Street?
Yes, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they violate the decrees.
This is ignored by both the city police and the Prague City Hall.
It's not even a cat anymore, it's total indifference.
Business of Prague Taxi Drivers in Numbers
However, some of them, although only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: are you satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be bad, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to get a little better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to get him out.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, there are more of them, of course.
Are you always trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it’s still bad.
Just last week, I caught a taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although then he claimed that it was an amount of 56 crowns (he used a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt, the cops arrived, and this taxi driver was so cute he was still going to the cops and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on a taximeter glued a decimal point and robbed tourists by 357 crowns.
Can you say that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed in your shots the faces of those who charged meaningless amounts for a short ride?
Their insolence is still unbelievable.
What happened to the taxi driver claiming $56?
The police sent him away, saying they could not discuss him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in this court (six taxi drivers and one ex-employee).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings of the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I've always wanted to use the footage only for reporting.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from the court?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not live on it.
You were talking about a decimal point trick, which especially in front of foreign clients underwater taxi drivers shift.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they afraid to continue using this trick after the publication of your reports?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show.
I was driving with a taxi driver recently, bragging in front of me that he was the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed that the side of the taxameter was glued black cardboard.
When I asked him what he had, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines didn’t work too well for the taxi drivers, can the court and their colleagues make a warning impression on them?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You said you thought they'd always find a way to cheat.
I don't think there's anything that can deter them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should be fighting more to get them out of there.
I have to say from my experience that, fortunately, the fair taxi drivers in Prague are predominant.
But do they want to go against those who corrupt the reputation of their services?
They have taste, but they lack the mind.
They don’t know much about it and can’t say exactly what they want.
When they staged the demonstration (due to a proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>), it did not express very clearly what they actually wanted.
They once said they weren’t protesting against Uber, they just wanted the same terms as Uber, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and it turned out to be the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you overall assess the approach of the Prague City Hall in solving the problem of overestimation of fares?
It is clear that the criminal police had to enter into this in order to solve something.
The magistrate was too short for that.
They had a mole out there that was leaking information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope that the clerk will be charged until the last check with all the failed checks, so that he will realize what he did.
That's the worst part of it.
I was even on a control ride with him, which I found out only later from their schedule.
It has been several months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I think especially with foreign viewers, which is actually the most focused series.
Every time I have friends from abroad, I play these videos to them.
And when we walk through the Old Town Square, it is surprising that the same people that are seen in the pictures are really standing there.
Famous Prague celebrities.
Seriously, though.
I'd build a fence around them so people would watch them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Oh, yeah.
I travel with services where I do not have to pay in cash, but by card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also a lot of dispensaries that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street once since.
The driver said to me after getting in the car, "Well, you have the courage."
A theme in disguise for an Italian tourist.
The fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported as early as 2005.
In the same year, former mayor Pavel Bem went on a check-up ride in disguise as an Italian tourist, and at the first attempt, the driver cheated him by two hundred.
The editor, Rube<0xC5><0xA1>, had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him CZK 820 for the ride from the Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which is about CZK 195 per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague City Hall set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometre.
There are also other surprising sums in the filmed reportage: for example, a two-kilometer road from Parizska Street to Truhl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> Street cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For the ride to And<0xC4><0x9B>l, which has 2.5 kilometers, they charge even six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mainly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Dirt goes well from it, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it needs to be plucked out of the folds.
It's not easy and it's not quick, the restaurateur Vanesa Trostov<0xC3><0xA1> from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in H<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xAD> has approached her work.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is framed with scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb up and down again and again.
"The restaurateur should be careful, patient and unpretentious to the work environment," she said.
It is not her first restoration work in Fridlantsk.
Thanks to her, for example, stone elements of the facade in the back tract of the Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Town Hall were restored, she also restored statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Z<0xC3><0xA1>ti<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>, St. John of Nepomuk in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant, Piet in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantsk<0xC3><0xA1> Okru<0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xAD> Street, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> pole in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant or atlant in the front of M<0xC4><0x9B>k Nové L<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Catherine of Redern began in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of dirt and crust, the loosened stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
Treatment and preservation of the surface are also waiting for them.
The inscriptions on the tomb are gilded again.
"Then it will begin by gilding the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure sliced gold," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>, State Monuments Protection Officer of the City Office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There is no record from the past that the tombstone has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, the holes drilled in marble columns will be captured.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately, after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
The tombstone was literally mowed, Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross, the restaurateurs are at home with a slight exaggeration.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombstones that were underwater, the baptistery was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tombstone.
"We would like to go to the stained glass windows in the future," Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration works on the restoration of the Redern tomb will cost a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the restoration.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from the prize in the regional round of the Historical City of the Year 2015 competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns will be the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer.
The decision to release the prize for the restoration of the tombstone was made by the representative office.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) in the period of one and a half months.
Low volatility and growth prevail in the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P 500 index, which underwent a 12% correction in February, is now at a new historic high and has already posted 7% since the beginning of the year.
The iron rule is reaffirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long run, which in the end have always achieved their goals.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic high, volatility is again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank, and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And not to either.
Although the Fed is continuing to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in both Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy <0xC2><0xA3>70bn in bonds over the next six months, also stepped in.
Thus, the new wave of quantitative easing pushes already low returns even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
That is the million-dollar question, of course.
But at the moment there are no risks, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing, and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if US stocks continue to hold out under a similarly calm regime.
It's a pity that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said the head of the European Commission Juncker, when he appointed a French politician (really experienced, because he has been wiped out by so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find) as the main negotiator of the European Commission of the conditions for the UK's departure from the EU.
Juncker’s choice blew away hints of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media accepted Barnier’s name as Juncker’s war act.
Barnier is a rocky European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of the reform of European banking law.
He conceived it as only he could: a hardened enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and of the model of capitalism.
The proponent of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union, and with resentment for everything that comes from the London financial center City, he enforced the legislation of excessively strict regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a hard, relentless and, apparently, ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, the overview and the empathy of Prime Minister V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus - at least in this -.
It would be for the good of everyone!
Earthquakes around Putin?
The head of the Kremlin has released his close friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media with reference to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin said Ivanov was being released at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossiya 24, the president said he was meeting Ivanov’s wishes when he took office that he wanted to be president for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the president's administration, now led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is considered one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
This former KGB officer, for example, has held the post of defence minister and deputy prime minister in the past.
He will now leave the chair of the president’s security council.
Ivanov, however, said at a meeting with Putin that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record holder.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people had already taken the place.
Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> and D<0xC4><0x9B>bli<0xC5><0xA1>tky Uncle with <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> will not play the final.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have turned into a final.
Petra Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was the first to lose the match, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise Monica Puigov<0xC3><0xA1> after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> was followed by Czech debutantes <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>v<0xC3><0xA1> and Str<0xC3><0xBD>cov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the first set, the Williams sisters' slayers reached after winning, but lost two sets, and the Russians eventually took the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set 4-6.
Half the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by the Czech rowing: skipper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia, despite the dismissal in the end by almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for progress.
So it's taken some of their strength, which could make it easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing into my cards, said the rower of the Prague Dukla.
Mirka Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1>-Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1>, however, did not walk in Snyk's footsteps.
The 35-year-old rower finished fourth in today’s semifinals and will start in the B finals and fight for 7th to 12th place on Saturday.
That's not how the gold from London is defended.
It was the first time I didn’t make it to the Olympics.
I’m a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race and put everything I could into it.
The rivals were simply better, Topinkova Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> leaned in front of them.
She fought until the end and believed that she would get in her fourth games among the elite six.
She gave up the fight just before the finish line.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could move out of the field.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman who had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it through to the finals.
Unfortunately, today was the race of life, said the world champion from 2011.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was a young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to break out of the qualification for the second time, this time small-eared in a lie.
In it, Nepejchal took the 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky advanced from the first place with 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigoryan (628.9).
Nepejkal's shot was 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in Rio, among them Czech seven-year-olds Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> ranks eleventh after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1> is twenty-two.
It is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as continuous second Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best high-altitude performance in the seven-fight.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
Looking away from the absurdity of this question: German society has gone through a deep self-reflection, but Russian society has not.
In both great Eurasian nations, dictators emerged in the 20th century, and regimes came to power that were inhuman, brutal, and horrific.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of Communism reported in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis exterminated about 6 million Jews in an inhumane way, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned territories, atrocities were carried out by the Germans and the Soviets.
There were not only a few individuals guilty in Germany or in the USSR, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively or simply by putting its head in the sand.
This is not a specificity of these peoples, we Czechs are similarly guilty.
In Germany, an immediate end to the war came denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you do that?
This has brought true reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned about the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to rejoin Alsace-Lorraine or retaliate - military attack - everyone will recognize this.
After the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium, when a former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of our own people are of no value to the squirrel.
Fight yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only the decade-long despotic regime that Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – predestined to Asian (self) tyranny.
Who is benefiting from rising tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who is benefiting from rising tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia again deteriorated.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side was the peninsula of Crimea, which was annexed more than 2 years ago to Russia and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides are contradictory and difficult to verify independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about the old known question, who benefits from it?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea by the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia has already come from the case of pilot Savchenko that they were allegedly abducted on the territory of Russia.
If we were to adopt the Ukrainian version, how would Russia benefit from worsening the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, in the background of the immigration crisis in Europe, there has been a retreat from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit in front of its citizens, when the current support for President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have gone bankrupt a long time ago without generous financial injections from the EU and the IMF in particular.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to relentlessly draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the security forces again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up even to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives not only of soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy, and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria shows inflation for first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, so monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods increased: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained at the same level as in the previous month.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been monitoring Russian hacking for over a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was dealing with an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, no official report mentions Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report on monitoring the alleged Russian attack was top secret because its disclosure would reveal that US intelligence agencies are monitoring the hacker attack and could reveal how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were reportedly involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The Russian trace material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight top members of Congress, called the gang of eight in the United States, were briefed.
It is composed of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the chairmen of the Democrats in both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of Congress' defense and security committees.
On Thursday, Democratic Party chief executive Donna Brazile announced that she was setting up a cybersecurity advisory body to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of Democratic Party servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon from Alberto.
The chain apologised.
On the basis of the consumer's initiative on health problems after consuming the food Salmon wild smoked - pieces of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague sanitary authorities carried out a check in the Albert shops at Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stku.
The inspection found that the lot L23012562/T4 with the expiration date of 22.11.2016, which the customer has pointed out, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the expiration date of 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-ingested live larvae can penetrate the stomach wall into the internal organs, <0xC5><0xA0>ticha said.
We apologize to our customers for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the aforementioned lot from the sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other lots of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier with whom we are dealing, and at the same time we had to test this product ourselves, spokeswoman Albertu Barbora Vanko told Novinka.
If the customer has purchased this product, they can return it in any of the stores of the chain and get their money back.
Larvae will destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The Prague and Central Bohemian veterinary authorities informed hygienists about the occurrence of a dangerous product.
According to the server safetypotravin.cz, people after ingestion of the parasite can get anisakiosis, which manifests itself in severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can proceed asymptomatically, the CTK said.
Symptoms appear one to two weeks after eating insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to high and low temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians have also checked the salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The shipment of 1700 products came to the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Dispatched, for the most part to the Ahold chain, to date, there have been 919 packages.
Currently, unsold stocks of the product are being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told <0xC4><0x8C>TK on Friday.
Immediately after positive samples were found, veterinarians banned the shipment of other products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to flee Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian airstrike.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage with a jihadist who was soon killed, sobriety came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate turned for the British girls into a hell on earth from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She made repeated phone calls to Britain and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have orders to shoot without hesitation, the Telegraph quoted the lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last traces led to Raqqa, where the girl heard from for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
Her family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape, as the house she was staying in leveled the airstrike in May, Britain’s ITV News reported.
TV said the bomb appeared to have been dropped by a Russian plane attacking the IS stronghold in Syria.
You would bring blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week she was thinking about escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, an Austrian woman was caught trying to escape and according to available information, she was publicly killed.
I think she interpreted it as a warning and decided not to risk it, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with her 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, embarked on a journey on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey to ISIS-controlled territory.
According to the lawyer, the girl's family did everything in their power to get Kadiz back.
You would bring blue out of the sky just to get your child out of the perilous area and this family did everything they could, strained to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he said, is that Kadiza’s fate could serve as a deterrent to other girls or even boys who let themselves be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how different it is from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to return,” Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they are also silent, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
Going to jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the county seat and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
From the middle of the 18th century, courts were held in the town hall and the basement under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were deplorable, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them successfully.
Therefore, city officials decided to move the prison premises to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
It was not in operation for a long time anyway, it was closed for economic reasons at the end of August 1889, as smaller repair facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
Stories of convicts and ghost hunts.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different the conditions were.
Guides in period costumes further enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room, where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked in one of the cells, mostly for the sake of a photograph as a souvenir, or to instill the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
Moreover, Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous haunted sites.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have already gone there, and to this day the museum allows people to come and hunt some ghosts.
Such a night, however, will cost 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
Snapchat’s ‘anime’ effect is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users every day to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that seems to step out of Roy Lichtenstein’s image.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be published immediately.
In the past, Snapchat filters have earned criticism with accusations that the app promotes blackfaceing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when this week she offered users a filter that made their eyes sloping, their teeth crooked, and their faces swollen, some critics called it a racist cartoon of Asians — “yellowface.”
And they asked if these repetitive contentious questions pointed to the larger problem of society — the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and indignation quickly spread, and Snapchat announced the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded painful stereotypes in action.
The others, unpacked, refused to compare with the anime.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that "it is difficult to argue against the comparison of the obvious Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is drawn to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Holywood and the equipment we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — can mean that you can expect even more sensitivity.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some users,” Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview on Thursday, “it’s very difficult to ignore these things today, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believed racially motivated issues reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
Katie Zhu criticized the overwhelming white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and colored people at the moment when these things are decided,” said Zhu, who is of Sino-American descent, “or colored people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak.”
Other observers share her opinion – a complaint Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, “I’m wondering if they really need more users like that who can say it’s not okay,” with their account remaining closed.
Military officers misrepresent intelligence on IS, parliamentary committee says
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command were changing intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than events from the country had provided.
According to a preliminary report by a working group drawn up by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Subcommittee, there has been "widespread dissatisfaction" among central intelligence analysts, according to which their superiors have altered their assessment of the U.S. effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release, the report said: “The intelligence intelligence statements approved by Centcom’s senior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the US counterterrorism efforts than were confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are harmed when the superiors of policymakers are presented with a wrong analysis," said Ken Calvert, a California congressman and Republican.
The failure of the Centcom leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the central staff’s ongoing problems in describing and analysing U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report said analysts had the impression that Centcom leaders were under pressure to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State, or IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many central staff press releases, statements and congressional statements were significantly more positive than what they actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack on Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“This is very clear after months of investigations,” said MP Mike Pompeo, a Republican representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranking U.S. intelligence officials manipulated the headquarters’ intelligence outputs to downplay the dangers of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a task force after learning of analysts' concerns that intelligence information relating to the Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following a report released on Thursday, further investigations must be followed by more in-depth investigations.
In the intelligence services of Centcom, another investigation is underway, led by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for evaluating information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and Representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, the process “led to misrepresent intelligence outputs,” damaged morale among analysts, and “insufficiently took into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House has tried to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their findings according to “the draft or the political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation of the Pentagon inspector general, which was initiated after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
However, he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these fundamental national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is a success (a statement that now declares a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to sincerely evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of Islamic State reporting has reflected conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush's administration - despite objections from many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and devoted little time to thinking about it.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic State’s intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group’s financial resources as the group built temporary refineries and sells oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been forwarded outside the central staff.
Centcom’s commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate’s testimony too positive about the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The U.S. won the land hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be the decisive match in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, and a day later she scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's land hockey team, in which the U.S. defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two matches is a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she wasn't sure if she'd ever done anything like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: the Americans in the Olympic tournament lead to the games 4: 0 and share the first place in the group with Great Britain, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2: 0.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals and the match will decide which of the group of six teams will finish in the first and who in the second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group, for a little longer.
No matter how Saturday’s game ends, the Americans caused a stir here with their surprising ride, four years after they ended up among 12 teams at the games in London.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make the finals.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team had much success.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as the coach, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we did not have the work pace we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal with a backend from nearby.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and maintained a 1-0 score until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then slipped into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the American women in the lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the fourth quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Zen trampoline in the middle of Olympic rage
It doesn’t matter where you are, it doesn’t matter what time it is – it’s the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro, you can feel a persistent, indescribable and biased alternation of competition and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a hot relay pin, which is passed from a diver to a swimmer, gymnast and triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the café queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming lover of women with slits in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households during the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsor spots, if he is a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic Flame does not shine in all competitions the same way.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not universally recognized: shooting with air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will most likely rule for a long time.
But if I may name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I interviewed didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline, and until 2012 none of the athletes even reached the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, gold medals from London will be awarded to Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But jumping on a trampoline has yet another bad luck, partly because the ear of the uninitiated will seem more suitable for a clown university than for an Olympics.
I must admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiastic observer from the country.
It has comic potential – comic vibrations of infinite reflection – but also the sleekness of gymnastics and diving, two sports that it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "jumping board."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline, which shoots them up to almost 10 meters high and show sets with several elements (salts, screws and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by performance, difficulty and "time in the air".
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Fighters for gold medals must go on, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
It is trying to catch up not only with the target tape or the starting wall, but, as TV news reports, also with another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical—and enough to make the audience cry.
But I think it's also a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on a trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulty it is not possible, but for the duration of the composition there will be no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measuring of distance, but only a perfect, graceful streak of time and gravity.
This is only the closest when the Olympics and Zen are approaching.
The women's qualification and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of the afternoon block, which starts at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that, despite the other duels, you will probably miss.
And if attention is to be gained only by male athletes being the subject of infatuated looks and materialization – as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by U.S. gymnasts – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
"Protesting Generations" in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a threat of war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government riots, which are spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses say police officers shot and killed crowds of unarmed demonstrators.
Video clips of the protests, probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, show members of the security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even more difficult to move forward,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is backed by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy was developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train running in the capital city of Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - human rights organizations are constantly talking about government repression - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
However, that can change.
“When you strangle people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, who lectures at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
An entire generation has protested.
There are many complaints, ranging from land disputes to absolute control over the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing, and the conflict along this imprecisely marked, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromian Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate via social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxy, which will hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they had gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oroms and the Amhars, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromians and the Amhars are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, have excelled in politics and commerce and exploited the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's changing, too.
"We are on our way to unified leadership," Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oroms, said.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and controls the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful at detecting initial signals of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process opponents and win over to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they have no confidence in security services controlled by the Tigres.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such riots was in 2005, when thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government plundered and then stole.
A hard-hit followed, during which many protesters were killed - albeit less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
It is clear, however, that the gradual escalation of disputes within the Ethiopian government has not stopped this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigrean-owned businesses last month, and resentment against Tigreans on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in an uncomfortable situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared that the base has been closed.
While the West wants to unequivocally support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in an already volatile region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and ISIS Financing as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried on Friday to downplay the latest controversy that floods his campaign, saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in a difficult situation, who tried hard to defend him in a turbulent time, and he has to explain that he may not have been serious about his remarks.
Following this proposal at a Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created ISIS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old one just one day when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help ease Trump’s remarks by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy, while his preferences in election polls are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan Duel on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the issue.
On Twitter, he once again warned that Clinton’s proposals were linked to a tax hike, and said her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he reaped a wave of criticism when he suggested that the Russians should infiltrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remarks by saying, “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some of the reports have a response from his supporters to find out how they are responding, and according to the response then one way or the other, ‘give an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language the two candidates used.
But I also think that he is adept in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained in different ways.
As poll results continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more divisive tone in recent days, rather than softening things for general voters.
A new survey by the NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apologies for the provocative remarks he makes, but he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, who must stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his remarks.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to swell and fail to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s Pennsylvania gatherings, Trump continued to fire the media around him on Twitter for breaking his every word and being biased toward him.
He laughed at the "poor, pathetic" television scholars who were trying to understand him, and said, "They can't do that!"
Several Democrats sneered at Trump’s apology, saying it was just further evidence that he was not eligible for the presidency.
The café has been pushed out of the market by prices. Now it is back in Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soaps in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted and the Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even re-used the lighting from the old Verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
There are ham, egg and cheese sandwiches and toppings, such as capers and fried onion.
You will also find a bowl of brown rice.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original stamgasts.
“Many of the original customers had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveir, was here.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented Verb Cafe.
It happened even after the coffee shop moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verb," she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, but that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she put on a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
They go to work and always order the same thing.
"At quarter and eight every day, like a watch, I come here, and they're already preparing my bun for me with everything and butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what he usually does, but sometimes he has bacon, eggs and ham on his bun.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap business had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the cafe well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said that he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose her to make his new neighbors feel at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
A local fruit juice producer wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is an option to expand the café to the neighboring building.
A lot of customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the coffee shop reopens, going in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressed food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office for lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for the day was more modest: devil-like eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Zieglerman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book, 97 Orchard, tells the life story of a residential house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, A Square Meal, published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich shop, a small sloppy buffet in Flatiron, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, and Andrew, 57, had turkey, mashed potatoes, and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which, according to the couple, was excellent for talking about food during the crisis.
"The buns were very popular," said Ms. Zieglerman.
Peanut, liver and bean meat were sold.
They were made from that admixture and other cheap food that set the ingredients.
Imagine the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
'They'd be like lead in your stomach, 'he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet, eat what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers, and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. “A Square Meal” follows how the nation dealt with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as meatballs and casseroles, have spread as “an amazing way to take advantage of the leftovers,” Zieglerman noted, as chefs could hide unaesthetic ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat - for many years the focal point of American food - has become an economically allocated luxury.
The strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritious filler, took precedence over taste or even common sense when cooking.
During research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Siegelman prepared a period dish of roasted onion stuffed with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Zieglerman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter with roasted onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before and never after, domestic economists—among them Louise Stanley, the sheriff of the Federal Office of the Home Economics from 1923 to 1943—drive the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take the reins of the budget, and turned sloppy things like cream spaghetti with carrots into tasty foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical delicacies.
Most notably, the desserts were created in response to the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll Have a Pie” pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmer's cuisine of his childhood, he was dining as the chosen millionaire he had become.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," Andrew Coe said.
He was eating in an almost gold-plated room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't made him follow the example of his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not at all interested in taste, leading the White House to “not only serve nearly the most delicious food in all of Washington, D.C., but also the most dishlessly prepared.”
Many of the food habits of the crisis era faded as the country got back on its feet.
The link has remained in our constant exploration of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Zieglerman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book they better understood the eating habits of Ms. Siegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Zieglerman remarked, "The people were sick of her."
There was an accident with wreaths.
When the tables at Eisenberg were clean, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Zieglerman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly shoved the spoon into the dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as a proper landlord, he said to his wife, "It would be worth a little chopped squirrels."
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who flock to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
This is what the series would look like if we did it.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Among Us, are making fun of their home country.
With the help of photoshop, she creates collages that humorously show what it would look like if famous series and films were shot in Russia.
Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of a patent against type C jaundice against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimburse fees for lawyers who arose in the process of patenting type C jaundice against drug maker Merck & Co Inc.
In June, a court ruled that Gilead had to pay $200 million in damages for breaches of two Merck patents in connection with the highly successful drugs Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeatedly unlawful activity on Merck’s part, including lying under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing on Thursday that Gilead was entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next-generation market for hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owners of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed troops claim to have gained full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now combing the city after the departure of the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city.
Troops have freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which said the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in revenue in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in lecture fees to the common treasury, and the former Secretary of State admitted a $3 million income from Simon & Schuster for his book about his ministry.
Clinton's co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be models of financial transparency,” Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign, said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and retreats from his earlier promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department’s tax department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
“Your move,” campaign aide Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, citing the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits are over.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican Party members, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charities, trade deals and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has spoken out strongly on the issue, and released a video Friday in which she recalls how high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to publish his tax returns.
He will address the issue in his speech on economic issues in Michigan on Thursday.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades — publish their tax returns,” she said.
Politico said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist quoted a number of tax advisers and accountants as saying it could still be the case today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing for a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that everyone who makes more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffett invited Trump to a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the tax office, but of voters.
The Clinton campaign published tax returns retrospectively until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent and a combined tax of about 40.5 percent between 2007 and 2014.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, their wages are only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Nature conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human dwellings – throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
This has worked, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they’ve developed this ... set of tools, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation, said in a statement.
The first and second step is to light the passing elephant with a flashlight and start the horn.
If this does not stop him, the so-called “chilli cloud” will be thrown out.
The chilli powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with the firecracker in a condom, its end is narrowed so that only the wick looks out of it.
After being blown up, the condom explodes and a fine chilli powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually, one blow is enough, and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to detonate the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director leans back at Berlin hotel for removing code for calls to Israel at Arabs' "request" - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has sparked media outrage after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling to Israel, according to an employee based on a “request” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in a list of hotel codes.
However, the state was not listed among the countries that can be called directly from the room.
How is it possible that Israel was removed and erased in Berlin, the capital of Germany, in 2016?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception for a problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, in his words, “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this move was even more disturbing to the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel’s dialling code be deleted,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described the case as a “great shame”.
We were horrified and shocked by the event.
This in itself is a great shame.
The fact that something like this has happened in Germany and, moreover, in such a hotel chain is an even greater embarrassment.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online response, which people described as scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Shame on you,” says another post, which points out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel, the hotel itself quickly dropped any charges by calling the event a “overlook” and apologizing to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" not to include Israel in the list of codes for calls, a representative of the Kempinski Hotel quoted by the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in San Paulo, Brazil, on Thursday, as students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protesters.
The problem escalated when government law enforcement tried to disperse students, which ended with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals made by San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin to save money are the closure of nearly hundreds of public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters could be seen spraying signs on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff, when the country’s Senate ruled on her indictment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover increased by 70.9% year-on-year after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran.
The ambassador said that since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that do business in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
“The further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
During the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $ 856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record number of tourists from Iran to visit Russia this year.
Last year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
For the first time, Iran is among the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia last year will be overcome,” he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visited by a relatively small number of Russians, and the Ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
“Personally, I can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Cattle Callum Skinner rushes home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome when a trio of the UK team defended the title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy, and the young man delighted the legend when he landed at the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of favored New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won a surprise victory and Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in March, although Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of specialist introductory racer Jamie Staff.
So Hindes arrived just in time.
After Hoye's departure, a seat was also vacated, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of the British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes – who was together with Hoy the champion four years ago – and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind in his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The strategy change was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes going to a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes stepped onto the stage, he kept his eyes on them.
Skinner, a 23-year-old native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After winning alongside Kenny and Hoy in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track on purpose after a weak start.
He later withdrew the note, and Britain's rivals had no opportunity to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindes said, “With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London.”
Over the past three months, we've all come together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then five successful days await us at the Velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it is not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at a time.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, he also has a birthday on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day also celebrates the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
Same as how much Hoy got.
As the next one, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last another three days.
A 28-year-old native of Bolton said, “Now I’m enjoying this one.
The team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for myself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal race that day, but there was still good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in a four-kilometer race.
They finished with a time of 3:51,943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and finals (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will surely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioners when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women's race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia achieved a world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team to master the middle period of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating complete dominance in Beijing and London, expectations dropped during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events unfolded in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the termination of the career of greats such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the races at the Velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
The uncertain future of the Portland smelting plant after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum smelting plant in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant supplying the plant and informing of the intention of one of the smelting owners to terminate the electricity supply contract. All electricity supply contracts are expected to be shortened.
The move comes after the government of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the grant they are keeping the company running.
A fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs at Alcoa Portland could be at risk.
When closed, up to 2,000 jobs can be at risk - direct or indirect.
And because the smelting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity production, there could be more avalanche impacts.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesea plant last year.
Alcoa's melting pot in Portland is a waste and threatened with closure.
The move follows years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and more recently due to factory production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelting plant at the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small trading shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue operating, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the smelting plant will continue,” she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts are so-called ‘security contracts’, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to assume that the contracts will contribute to the profit for the fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL profits from fiscal 2018 is currently limited due to a strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its ledgers of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ... ability to operate a smelting plant or secure the supply of electricity to a smelting plant.”
The American company said it had entered into a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect in November of this year, although it still had to explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland smelting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both companies withdrew from the market, it would result in a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a producer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the Kardashian real estate TV show - he is now the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of Kris Kardashian-Jenner's mother, appeared on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder, who performed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the front page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a sequel to the humorous one performed by the Kardashians?) staged video, in which the entire Kardashians-Jenners family (the colorful rioters Rob and Caitly and with them all a favorite uncle from show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest).
It’s a busy storyline of almost every “birthday” part of a children’s TV show (Seacrest says, “Did you think we forgot about you?” with the honesty of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o’clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure the other girls could make a living on this publicity.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we are definitely entering a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim Kendall's older sister may have pushed Vogue on the cover (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionist calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
Revealing the star, which will appear on the front page, is eagerly awaited, so it’s no wonder that in the past two years, images of the magazine have escaped before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more “celebrities made by models” than “models made by celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar-winning Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Laga Gaga.
But while it is highly unlikely that Kendall – described by the magazine as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – will fall into the first category, she will be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, not even the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are proven talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is enthusiastic about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the Vogue cover.
But this dissatisfaction is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He's performing for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter that she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she performs on a reality show, perhaps only as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are rejected each year in community-based legal aid centres, and the sector itself is gearing up for the impact that further cuts in funding will have on already overused services.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair evictions and the like - are being rejected as they seek free legal aid and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to burst, are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Aid Centers, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, 5,000 people were rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the cancellation of the federal government's decision, the situation would deteriorate.
“Communal legal aid centers in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers being unfairly fired - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions, and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands more at-risk Queenslanders having to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator of Queensland, George Brandis, to prevent this cut in funding immediately, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the government has met its commitment to provide legal aid funding up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community centers for legal aid and the community of their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign lawsuit after a staff member allegedly pointed a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the North Carolina operations director had pointed a gun at a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed over Wednesday to the state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for the situation to be resolved internally before concluding that “it will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pointed his fingers at the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed the barrel at Vincent's tip," Bordini said in a statement.
Bordini, after complaining to local and regional campaign leaders, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a stir when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners (which is regulated in the U.S. Second Amendment) could intervene if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could appoint her judges.
Trump’s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for reckless surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the report requesting a comment.
Attempts to get statements from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in the city of Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
No one answered the call to his consultancy Innovative Consulting Services in a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just like London 2012, when we made an extraordinary effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions can benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games were hugely beneficial for both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
We will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs for our local communities, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow, it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, and leave a legacy of skills and employment both near the airport and across the UK.
At Heathrow, we have a great team that, on time and on a budget, has put in place an infrastructure investment program of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, starting with Terminal T5 - which was chosen as the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third runway, costing <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 Games in London were a huge success for the UK and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will be one too.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand Heathrow, to secure future trading and to leave behind a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the board of directors and former deputy for business affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in Cat and Mouse game in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have turned cat and mouse games for companies that make money from online marketing, at least according to one of the companies that program such software.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block ads on that social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday its desktop website would change the coding around ads to make it harder for ad filters to determine which parts of the site are ad-friendly.
But Adblock now claims the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source community and those trying to bypass it has been going on ever since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-help fix.
The fact that the company that owns the largest social network in the world has become involved in the war only proves how big a problem the blocking of advertising for industry has become.
According to the study, Pagefair made the web last year and Adobe uses ad filters around 200 million people around the world – almost four times as many as in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company is against ad filters on desktops because mobile ad filters on social media and Instagram mobile apps don’t work.
Ads on desktops still represent a profit high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to give people the ability to better control how ads are displayed to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters were worrying them, as they could also block non-advertising-related content on the site.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Advertising blocking is a non-sensitive tool, which is why we prefer to focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
Woman hit by car on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman who allegedly tried to commit suicide was run over by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" was lying in the dark on the road and had been run over by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to police, not all have yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation has been opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, legal counsel Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Could the impact have been prevented?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of death for negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
In court, it was said that the victim, aged 22, drank alcohol and passed out on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the presence of the man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident at Morges should report to the police by calling 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies (ACCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to come to Prague as part of the Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of ACCA Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> announced this.
The sixth edition of the Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival brings to life lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT).
About 35,000 people took part in the event last year.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized businesses," Petr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to the survey of the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend on average 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, is interested in stays in higher priced sessions with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others,” Petr<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium takes place as part of the festival program.
The lectures are given by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars on Saturday, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letn<0xC3><0xA1>.
The parade, which has been attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year honors a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June attack at a nightclub in Orlando, where the assailant shot 49 people, mostly gay.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
The irresistible cutthroat Pat and Mat, whose quest usually ends in disaster, has been entertaining small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were cartoon jokes by the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, which he invented for the magazine with two cuties, Mr. Ouhol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Mr. Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kub<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and artist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Jir<0xC3><0xA1>nek to collaborate and together they created the film Kut<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xA1>ci.
Today's form with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio show was given to the characters in 1979, when the series for the Slovak Television began to be created in the Short Film Prague.
The names Pat and Mat were given to the dolls in 1985, this time it was filmed directly for Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own animation studio AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were produced.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of them with the participation of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>’s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these cutlets, to which everything is poured under their hands, but they are never angry with each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and DIY enthusiasm, and finally they are satisfied with their work, which is proved by the famous gesture "... and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs and theatres, and figures or other toys depicting Pat and Mat are a hit in every toy shop.
A fairy tale for Fiji and two-year-old Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen one sport and one life for you.
Both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on at airports?
This is Friday's report from the World Wide Web.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
Rugby selection of this archipelago was defeated in the final of the Olympic tournament of the seven-point rugby team of Great Britain.
It was the first medal that Fiji won for itself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to come, it took sixty years for the first expedition to the Olympic Games.
Fiji's coach has a great reputation for success.
The irony is that he is Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final, as a British citizen, he could be satisfied, unlike his compatriots.
“Let’s play freely and lightly and see if we can make the biggest game in our history,” he said.
Fiji was eventually sovereignly dominated, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, a 2-year-old woman who has lived without arms and legs for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," said the two-year-old girl, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off her arms and legs and then sit together without prosthetics.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, doctors gave her only a 10% chance of survival.
There's nothing I don't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny, and she never gives up.
It also has a view.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words "Hi, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands," the mother added.
Look at the joy the doll brought.
What do we spend the most on at the airport?
According to CNN, people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
The Hudson’s travel essential stores chain has published data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products customers buy most frequently at its airports.
The water was the first.
Drinks were generally very popular, in the first ten there were eight.
The ninth place was taken by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
As one of the above things can not be eaten.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include the New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include U.S. Weekly, In Touch, and The Economist.
Rowing Sovereigns.
We're just going to win, they were laughing at Murray and Bond.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been ruling the two-man category without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
At first glance, the disparate pair moved to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas Lagoon, they won 69th in a row in the final on Thursday.
In what are we different than others?
We are simply prettier, Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand couple.
Honestly, we do nothing different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we’re constantly trying to improve our technology, that’s our philosophy,” Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre-long, stoke-kilometre-long chaser, the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, and Murray has had a charity boxing match, for example.
They don’t spend much time together outside of rowing.
Eric's getting on the ship, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what could go wrong, Bond admitted, who also demonstrated at a press conference that Murray was dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy the opponent with calm force.
They are driving at their own pace, and although they are often not in the lead halfway through the track, their opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We are racing on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to drive the first kilometre.
We're just trying to go at a pace no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” Murray, 34, said.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Olympics in Beijing a year later, they decided to move to the 2nd without a rudder.
At the Olympics in London, they probably repaid the biggest defeat of their career and confirmed the dominance in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us and didn’t ask questions.
It was a little more fun this time.
“We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well,” Murray said.
We all want to be ousted from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model to study Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and saturated with CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could have prevailed.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotation speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But according to the latest simulations, it seems that Venus once boasted a rare Earth-like atmosphere while spinning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet may have been drier than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to use the Sun, which was 30 percent damper.
"In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus, during a slow rotation, exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a new report.
This heats up the surface and creates rain, creating a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and protect the surface from too much solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapor was burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped, and only the dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effects of greenhouse gas remains -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would start looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the last three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
For a long time and intensely over the summer, I have been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who received Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and the first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and during the last two years he always failed to play after the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015–16 season, missing five points to earn a second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Plate Workers Resume Talks and Interrupt Strike
Top negotiators said strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea have been suspended, while all parties to the dispute have met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the service company for the oil fields Wood Group occurred sporadically on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process to resolve current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, to protest wage cuts is by as much as 30 percent.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company argues that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
Shell, on the other hand, has removed thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries to modernize its processes - immediately after a mega-fusion with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes of a generation that led to a North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
By comparison, nearly $1.4 billion in investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching adulthood and have formed over 125 million years.
Now it spins the fastest.
At peak rotational speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation speed slows down.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by measuring the time between the detection of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotational speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, bigger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades ballet, we see that the slower-spinning stars are more massive, while the fastest-spinning stars are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing star quality and rotational speeds.
“The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There’s still a lot to learn about how, when, and why stars slow down their rotational speed, so to speak, “hanging their dance shoes on a nail.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Pleiades’ rotation speed in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not register, then the qualification agreement would not be concluded and after a few months I could move to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialized education?
My point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a vacancy only in a somewhat distant hospital, but in about half a year there could be a place in another, where I would like to work.
I do not know how to deal with the situation in the last six months, the question continues.
Responds Mgr. Lenka Vlkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institute governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the health sector, however, there is a long-term pressure not to conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
Pursuant to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialised competence to practice the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, it is expressly true that participation in specialised training is considered to be an extension of qualification (not an increase in it).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement or obligation to enrol in specialised education.
The law only determines the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialized education.
However, according to the law, a doctor is entitled to practice the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, although under the conditions laid down by the law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization can be included in the specialist education of a doctor, if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the interviewer.
However, given that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health by law provides advisory and consultancy services related to the inclusion in specialised education and its course.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors from Syria's Halab are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (rebel parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to enforce civilian protection, the White House said in a letter.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, and even prayer; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not surrounded again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop strikes in the Halab region every day for three hours from today to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CEST all military activities, air attacks and artillery fire are to be stopped.
U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but said a two-day truce was needed.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors working in the rebel-held eastern part of Halab have appealed to Obama in a letter.
He writes that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel death of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and noting how complex Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like only slightly veiled threats, according to pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria over the past month, 15 of them on hospitals they work in.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who lives and who dies.
Young children come to the emergency room with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don’t even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion cut off oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They gasped for breath, and then their life ended—before he could really begin, they recalled.
An army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded rebel-held eastern Halab in recent weeks, leaving more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant strikes by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the siege and launch an anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides were then reinforced in and around the city.
