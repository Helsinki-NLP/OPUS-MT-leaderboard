Civil Rights Movement Issues Travel Alert for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s travel recommendation for the state of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors, and residents of Missouri to pay more attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently taking place across the state,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of current Missouri law, which makes it difficult to defend racist acts in court, as well as the actions of law enforcement agencies that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police officers just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the NAACP, told the Kansas City Star.
"We have the largest number of complaints to date."
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the state of the United States.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling across the country and was thrown into custody by police without being charged with a crime.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, which states that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to alert people and warn their families, friends and co-workers about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay bail or alert their relatives that they are going to travel to the state."
According to the current FBI program, there were 100 cases of hateful behavior in Missouri in 2015, which puts the state 16th among all states.
The travel alert is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder for companies to sue for discrimination in the provision of accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is meant to improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but more recently, advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by a chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is not at peace!
A model named Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie right in the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer was then sitting in a nearby cafe watching the careful criminal work of the crime scene search.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced to 34 years in prison in 2008 for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only confessed to assaulting the teenager in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had found the girl dead lying on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had been fighting on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really angry, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi drivers," he said falsely.
The girl, according to his testimony, was supposed to defend herself, if she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his horniness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt comfortable and had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,” she added.
And after twelve years, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
There are such cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," Linda's mother told the Mirror about the disappearance of the ash urn.
Linda waited for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czechs are not prudent or conservative," says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>, who runs Prague's Intimity boutique.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic aids.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It started inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a cycling trip around Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusual-looking vibrators.
“The various moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different,” he tells me over lunch.
His friend decided to work with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which intrigued Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced it.
Today, she runs the Intimity boutique in Prague’s Benedictsk<0xC3><0xA1> Street, where she sells erotic aids in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why wouldn't you?
These are also design items.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Come on, don't be so puritanical!
It was the Berlin store Fun Factory, designed by the renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the boutique Intimacy.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic commerce than everyone here is used to.
No covered windows, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to think about how to accommodate the Prague store, where it should be and what its name should be.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It has to do with intimacy, and it's, you might say, tender," she says.
It was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various visualizations of the interior.
In the end, the variant won, which spread the store into a garden of delight and a bedroom dominated by a bed.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nov<0xC3><0xA1> from FormaFatal studio.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem quite perfect, because he wasn’t on the main street, but thanks to that he sat down to the name of Intimacy.
He's intimate.
It’s in the alley next to the main one, so no one is looking at customers,” says Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of having entered such a trade at all.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the streets were empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like I was going to the sex shop.
Right at the door, I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Even if there is only a female servant in the store, so that women are not afraid to ask for help, this does not mean that a male foot would not come here.
Most of the time, men come here to buy presents for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know how to estimate the right size and choose the bigger one," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the old clichés that women need some big help, and it's not true.
So a man in good faith chooses, for example, an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer mostly black underwear, while women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product aptly called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face it must be clear that I do not know which beats, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
There is an adolescence in me to glean with admiration at the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it's not moaning.
And it's not really humming.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the shape of a sea horse.
He took care that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe couples.
He has completely destroyed the taboo that some men can endure, namely, that they see competition in erotic aids.
“There are different options,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
That's a favorite category.
When in love, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially among younger customers, it is very popular.
What about the men?
It is difficult to say whether such a concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess it would have to be taken a little differently.
The question is what to offer men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
They focus a lot on functionality and on the experience of use.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought that Japanese women would suffer a lot from erotic aids, I object.
“That’s the reality of the internet,” he explained.
The ordinary one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more related to the fact that they are used by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and on the contrary, they are taboo for women." Just to be interesting - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the boutique of Intimacy, sells worldwide, still makes up about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and Czechs are not very good.
On the contrary, we are a friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience with both sex life and some gadgets.
Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka take care of her return, making sure that each product is perfectly functional.
Also, we do not want to go into specialties like bonding and latex, because we do not have space for it, on the other hand, it does not fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who always had the shame of going to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would come out on them.
A lot of the products on the shelves are really appealing.
It is also given by a selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The seahorse was the first to be awarded, and this triggered a change in the entire industry.
They began to give up cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly, began to produce different designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that behind the design of some is the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I have to say that I was quite pleasantly surprised by how many people buy these design things from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, although they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight for Venus balls by Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She has done a really huge amount of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school work.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to control the production process and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a large-scale production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may be going a bit against the current, but it seems important to me to keep the development in the Czech Republic.
It could well happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything," Anna later describes to me the situation, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
There is no negative or negative attitude.
As much as possible, people are embarrassed.
Currently, Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> has a vibrator on offer for which you can make a personal message, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the next year, vibrating eggs and other news should be added.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the boundaries of what's okay are.
Is there anything Martin R<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE> wouldn't sell?
It's so hard to define.
What seems normal to one may seem completely abnormal to another, so we are more defined by the range of branded manufacturers.
None of them are going to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a final question: What was the craziest demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in in which a lady asked for masturbation aids for her boyfriend with a twenty-eight-centimeter-long nature.
We had to write that we didn’t have anything like that.
The question is, did anyone make fun of us?" Martin says with a suspicious glance.
And it happens from time to time...
A blow to Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel Szczedry is struggling with a serious illness.
Karel Gott's best friend struggles with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately," the singer himself confirmed the sad news to Lightning.
I know about my illness and I can handle it in the meantime.
"I'm taking medications that have the concomitant effects of the disease to slow down," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family gathered to make life easier for Charles.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, daughters from the first marriage of Zuzana and Tereza come to visit their father at the house on White Mountain, caring for their son Karel called Karlas.
Sved<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k fought with cancer twice and passed his experience to Slav<0xC3><0xAD>k to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's had 60 chemotherapy sessions.
He was able to return to work on the tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I have been predicted by the astrologer to be here by ninety," said Karel Flash.
He's a fighter.
He still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialov<0xC3><0xA1> is already struggling with the same disease in the institute.

Chile's parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the <0xC3><0x9A>S.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial abortion, so it cannot be done for health reasons.
“I am sorry that lawmakers have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will be deciding what we have been arguing about in parliament for more than two years,” said Isabel Allende, a Socialist senator.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
The law repealing the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would attack the law in court because it violated the right of the unborn child to life.
The vote on the bill was postponed last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Commission.
On Wednesday, MPs approved the proposal, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, abortion should cease to be a criminal offence in three cases: if a woman’s life is at risk, if the fetus has no chance of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, according to the Spanish newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, before women were given the right to vote there in 1949.
An absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world to have an absolute ban on abortion.
Other countries include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now behind bars, serving up to 30 years in prison for abortion.
In many cases, it was a spontaneous abortion, according to human rights defenders, which the court called murder.
Is there anything sacred at all?
Trump’s White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could tell the story as well as anyone else – see the carefully staged demolition of Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key proponents, certainly knew what he was up to when, in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he set out with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It's nice to add that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
For this he would be lynched by the crowd of owners of cruise ships and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its importance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, up to 17 years after the completion of the monument.
Miller rebuked Acosta by saying, “I don’t want to go down in history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
A poem that has been placed on the pedestal, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he himself said, this is not about history.
These are above all the striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate with today's times - inviting not only immigrants, but the poorest of the poorest: "Let the one who falls come to me, the one who is poor, the one who can barely breathe, the one who is a miserable worm in the middle of full cities."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not seek to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict about the importance of the statue is part of a comprehensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to plant a plaque with a poem on the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing a classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
It also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The merging of the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to refute that meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh — John the Baptist on Trump’s rise to power — argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not actually invite anyone into the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He brings the torch of freedom out of the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States.”
Surprisingly, Limbaugh stumbles upon an important point.
The importance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the statue from the point of view of a exhausted and damned traveler who, often after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart to a new country.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that is, of course, a prospect that neither Miller nor Trump will accept.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the United Kingdom Athletics Federation, said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be "a huge benefit to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that "something strange is happening" in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on it," Black said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics thinks it has something to do with what they did.
British Athletics: It has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will race for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing," Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unfathomable feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.”
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400-meter hurdles at her fifth World Cup, said it was “unbelievable” that there were 16 Scottish athletes on the British team.
The previous record for 1983 and 2015 is seven.
Cross-country skier Muir has set five UK and two European records in the last year alone.
He will take part in the World Championships in 1500 m and 5000 m.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track over 1500 m. This season he won the British Team Races and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues joined the team, but in many cases they will also attack the participation in the finals and medals.
“The extraordinary thing about being captain of the team is that I was elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team members is a pleasure,” she added.
“I’m very proud of all the Scots who joined the team.
It proves where we've gone.
They are athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
And my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I just pointed out that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it takes place on home soil.
It is important to take advantage of the support of the domestic fans and rejoice that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I’m going to enjoy an incredible atmosphere.”
Blocking Facebook Critics: Don’t Run for Public Office if You Can’t Stand Voter Criticism
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to criticize him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn’t try to silence the critics.
Because, in 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression can be taken away from us—and the stupid and dumb will be led as sheep to slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on him to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s staff dismissed the lawsuit as unreasonable, and many “who cares” opinions appeared in comments on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second-highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not tempting.
As you can see, he runs his own state with confidence and strictly adheres to the principles.
He has also proven to be adept at using Facebook as the primary means of connecting with his constituents – and the publication of the first bare-headed photo after undergoing chemotherapy is no exception.
Blocking people who visit the governor’s website – which is a public forum, designated as official and managed by his employees paid with taxpayer money – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by saying that the blocking of comments came from the position of moderating the posts.
However, to use the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose contributions were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are - real people talking to their elected leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As they all said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lakshmi lawyer Sarma Ramani, M.D., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I have politely noted that I am disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in a commentary section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting the so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called “concentrated spam interest” would likely be called “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking reviews or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets, where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism, or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public official to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump faces a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The president of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of postage had almost the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and many anonymous writers questioned his leadership.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belissarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers and questioned Washington's decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piled up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and intimidation lie at the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly used free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Czechs spend more on their tariffs abroad than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On vacation, they have more time to browse the web, in addition, under the umbrella, they usually do not have the opportunity to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, swimming and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
This is according to recent statistics from O2.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available as part of the lump sum than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our citizens travels during the winter, data consumption has increased even fifty times this summer season.
In second place in the ranking of consumed data was then placed Italy.
Most Czechs call from Germany, where many of them go to work even during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, Croatia is visited annually by 800,000 Czechs, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year's record was July 7.
“Tens of millions of photos would fit into the transferred data,” said Silvia Cieslar, director of O2’s mobile segment.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is in neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to browse the Internet.
"Despite Austria, the Czechs are heading for the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While for data, the operator recorded high year-on-year growth after the release of roaming charges, for telephony, growth is much lower.
The number of roaming minutes has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge lead over other countries, Germany dominates here.
“Roaming calls are more used by business customers on business trips,” Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homely atmosphere at the Renaissance Club
Over the next three days, former golfer Ronan Rafferty will hope for a relaxed atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year lost to Paul Eales at the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals. This year he will serve as the tournament’s ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow up before my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to enjoy the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
The Englishman Eales will defend the title for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
'I feel good about it, 'said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory, the tournament was canceled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when for me and my wife Sharon, winning really meant a lot.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating his 50th birthday at the end of this year, is back at home.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on home soil," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to succeed and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am satisfied with the result so far.”

Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, it rarely uses a frying pan.
In her wooden hut, located in the capital Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local language "note" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potatoes and taste them with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as washing laundry in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof complements the toilet.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Work until late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"In the afternoon, after five o'clock, no one will allow themselves to wander around the village," Bardina says.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a public handshake before the occupying army.
The current movement protesting against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city that you can get there after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour stomach jamming ride.
Public transport in this place does not work.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rusty color.
Very few Indonesians looked at this place, let alone journalists, and practically no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark t-shirt, and bright skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and the country’s child mortality and literacy rate is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai – a rocky province roughly the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports the extraction of wood at an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
The mass murders in the tribal region of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that took place last year as extrajudicial executions, torture – according to another report, particularly popular rape and electrocution – and brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrators.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan sources attract colonists to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are Christian, but the demographics change with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital Jayapura to work.
"The original inhabitants of Papua - mother-mother (women) - lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, pledged to address inequality and rights abuses as part of his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter also secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But very little has changed in Papua, and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” he said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a camp fire in Enarotali, Indonesia, as two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the twilight of the night.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by this reproach and the tone with which it was uttered, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local parish priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers, in a drunken state, chased a group of children and beat them with the arms of their arms, the victims and witnesses of the event said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things got worse.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football field outside the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - which runs in a circle and imitates the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe of Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began throwing stones at the buildings.
With increasing tension, the soldiers were ordered via radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” the official document, which was never published in local media, said.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali district of Kego Koto, recognized the impending danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one cared about his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame did not know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, had been hit three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME in a sad voice.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were only “securing” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said a spokesman for the Papuan police, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped injuries.
The report of the murders was leaked by the Jakarta media the following day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his understanding for the families of the victims and promising to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again," he said.
National Security Minister Wiranto announced in October 2016 that he would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve acts of violence that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be heard.
“Most of the violence happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we are determined to punish these acts of violence, but it will not be an easy task," he said.
However, in an interview on June 5 for the TIME weekly held in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not plan to introduce any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said, “all cases will be brought to trial.”
Wiranto, who was accused by the UN of “crimes against humanity” on the basis of more than 1,000 deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 human rights cases had been settled so far in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting welcomed his claims with distrust.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but I haven’t seen anything yet,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
Indonesian police fired on villagers in neighboring Deiyai on Tuesday.
The clash, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between villagers and the manager of a construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the members, and the answer was a warning shot.
However, local residents say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retaliation," 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
“I didn’t leave the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the involved police officers and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many have joined the Papua Liberation Movement (OPM), a rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of OPM's leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents in recent years, all under the guise of “ensuring national sovereignty.”
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among Papuans as a “tragic and forgotten place”.
Poverty pours oil into the fire.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is equally unattainable.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
Fewer jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthy immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to start a business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of a lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from the papaya for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they received such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and West Papua face a great risk: non-recognition of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of reports from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook off the charges when he told reporters in Jakarta that: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local people shouted, according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the slogan “we want freedom”.
In 2019, Indonesia is planning another election, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions but surrounded by people associated with the Paniai shooting," said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a robbing army - are waving in poverty, poor education and a health system.
Gobai argues that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their voice to be a "debt" to be paid to Jok.
"They don't want money, they demand justice," he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims of the Panai shooting, they continue the last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the plot opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head down.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was going to Australia.
A four-member crew of the ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested during the operation.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was dragged by police after being detained to a port in the city of Nouméa, the capital of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were coming from and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate".
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop a large number of drugs going to Australia,” said Col Blanc, its chief executive.
The drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive destination for drug smugglers because of high street prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current attack is not the first.
Last month, three men were accused of transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific in a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
According to Pavla M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>, a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, the solution could be infusions of saline, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"In addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," said M<0xC3><0xA1>dlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Two liters should drink for sure.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In a nursing home, this is often not monitored by a doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually dealt with by infusions.
"I think it should be gradually introduced there too, so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be supplied to old people per day.
Lack of fluids can cause malaise, headache, and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he's talking in confusion," she added.
In case of negligence, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood thickens and clogs a blood vessel in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Laying patients should not be covered with a bedspread, a maximum of cotton sheets.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to occasionally expose the patient and allow the skin to ventilate," she said.
For the second time, The Torch has been on fire in Dubai.
On Friday, one of the largest residential skyscrapers in the world was on fire in Dubai, where firefighters had to evacuate all residents of the 337-metre-tall and 79-story building.
For the past two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We were asleep and the alarm woke us. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor," one of the skyscraper's residents, George, told Reuters.
The Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4:00 a.m. (0:00 GMT) before continuing to cool down the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark debate about the safety of materials used to cladding high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation, which started the management of the Torch skyscraper after the fire in 2015, showed that the most damaged were the lining and external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and cladding system at London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in a June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey found that more than one in five U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board.
A survey among passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the control post of the US government agency Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they were late in finding out that they were traveling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
According to a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - and answered by more than 1,000 respondents - younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to attempting to consciously travel with a TSA-banned item, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X members.
The most common items that escaped the attention of TSA include food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of the women and 3.7 percent of the men interviewed also admitted to intentionally carrying illegal drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport controls and how many did so on purpose.
Unsurprisingly, most people who have carried unauthorized items—whether consciously or unconsciously—have travelled by plane very often.
As the company pointed out, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what fluids and how much they can carry on the plane.
It is not surprising that TSA has seized the largest amount of the liquid that has just been banned.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would treat books the same way it would handle smuggled goods.
The transport of liquids is allowed on domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA Chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of the planned directives to reduce emissions of the Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by 15 states, its chief, Scott Pruitt, revoked his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced changes to his plan, responding more rapidly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention a legal challenge filed against his previous position at the federal appeals court.
This refers to the last deadline set for October 1st, when countries should begin to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce the amount of ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or impending economic growth.”
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma’s Attorney General prior to President Donald Trump’s appointment as EPA chief, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
Wednesday’s sudden turnaround is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA executive exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s plan to require oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
“Under the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits at the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take compliance seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations “will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure was still not passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal coercion.
“The turnaround in the EPA’s views – following our litigation – is an important victory for the health and safety of those 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause severe respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are grateful for Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying what kind of pressure needs to be put on to change the minds of responsible people and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological campaign of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
He spilled acid on a man, but he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
In one moment you are at home with your family and laugh, in the other you suddenly change your whole life from the ground up.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate met Andreas Christopheros from Great Britain, whose face was plastered with acid by an unknown assailant, who was eventually acquitted.
The information was provided by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at the Christophers.
Andreas stood up to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier outside the door that was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he had never seen in his life, immediately after opening without warning, poured acid on him, saying, "That's for you, buddy."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there they heard a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance to survive.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent of the face was affected, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A big complication for Christopheros was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
'You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes, 'he said.
Today, Christopheros has undergone 12 surgeries, which are far from the last.
Injuries to victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after demanding and long-term treatment, victims have scarred tissue for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and fight deformity and deformity for life,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was mistaken.
As for the attack, Christopheros is certain that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was taking revenge on a man who sexually abused a loved one.
The police investigated the case properly and then tracked down the assailant.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict to the astonishment of the Christopher family changed fundamentally.
"The three judges ultimately concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
Over the past few years, the number of attacks with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The interior ministry said it planned to provide new guidelines to prosecutors on the classification of corrosive substances.
These should be classified as dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks will not give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer sentences of imprisonment for people who invade their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as they are different cleaning products.
Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-story building were evacuated on time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," said one of the tenants.
Also, according to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire broke out on the top floors and spread down with falling hot debris.
We slept.
The alarm went off, people shouted.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said tenant George.
Another witness told CNN that the flames had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense report, the fire was managed to get under control.
The cause of its formation is not yet known.
According to witnesses, the surrounding buildings were drained of electricity.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying more than a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was hurt, as the residents managed to evacuate in time.
The Torch skyscraper was built in 2011 and became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
The record was set by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of 23-year-old Ippolit included a diverse collection of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces four years of distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record number of hit athletes.
The third-tier player began taking steroids a year before he failed bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> in the Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover passionately!
Just as Lucka Vondr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> entered the Czech Republic, she is in one round.
It also attracts attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell into her arms was her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time, and she certainly did not want to hang her career on a nail.
So they went away from each other, but they remained friends to this day.
This was also demonstrated at the press conference of TV Prima, where they met after a long time.
By coincidence, they both matched the blue color.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, because they will play together a lover couple in the new series Prime Captain Exner.
In the UK, Islamists were sentenced to life in prison for preparing an assassination attempt.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell called the Three Musketeers to life in prison and said it was planning a terrorist attack against police and the military.
Four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested last August.
At that time, the authorities believed that he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions, which in Arabic mean "infidels", and a mock gun.
This happened as a MI5 intelligence agent placed a wiretapping device in the car.
"The recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they had not been stopped," prosecutor Sue Hemming said in a statement.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years in prison.
During the trial in London, the men claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been placed there by an MI5 agent.
The court also heard him, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at the top for only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius, which were recorded in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region, it was overtaken by Thursday, which became the hottest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 out of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, Thursday’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
In the West, it was 10 degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, the greatest heat was in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, the highest temperatures so far on Thursday were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to rise only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away, and on Sunday there could be more significant rains.
However, in most places in Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia, as well as on Saturday.
China lacks tourists.
Beijing is losing billions due to visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to exert its influence without the use of force.
He spends $10 billion annually to support language schools and build universities abroad, pushing his entertainment industry into foreign markets and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not succeeding.
The state media are talking about the plan to make tourism the driving force of economic change and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals last year increased by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, according to Christopher Balding, professor of economics at Beijing University, in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China’s visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of the other countries have to deal with their visas in advance.
In the United States, Chinese New Year celebrations are similar to Chinese New Year celebrations.
A visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours in line for it, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study by the Journal of Economics and Finance found that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and is home to less than one percent of the total population.
China often deepens this problem by using tourism to pursue its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut traffic to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift over South Korea’s anti-missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and shunned China.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42% year-on-year, while Japan saw an increase of 85%.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent Fed report, China may have left as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will receive about $35 billion annually in the sale of the currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of the total Chinese surplus in trade in goods.
A small number of tourists, therefore, inflicts a very painful blow on a country that is anxiously hindering the outflow of capital.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of a more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, almost no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners in China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not at the crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually boost economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You won’t find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is being offered is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, particularly India and Vietnam, have been making great efforts to simplify and reduce the cost of issuing visas.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, they reproduced deadly reptiles.
The Pilsen Poison Kingdom can enjoy the pups of three rare, deadly reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2000 meters.
"It grows even meters in length," said Martin Vobruba, a spokesman for the zoo.
The young of the other two species, mortals and red cobras, will gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We don't want to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight Australian snake-killers have been born, descendants of a breeding pair native to the Sydney area.
"The one that visitors can see in the exposition is one of the deathlings from around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, it is necessary for the deathlings to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success was accompanied by a bundle of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen zoo hatched from four eggs in total four cubs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
Heading for the eyes, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on rats in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect hatching of the cubs from the nest of black mamba, the eggs are stored in an incubator.
According to an unauthenticated transcript of the phone conversation, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with senior officials from Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president accused him of publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull leaked to the public, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. surveillance agreement on refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement — which came under President Obama — he would look like he was “drogenized” after he proposed a ban on refugees entering the United States.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk again testified at the prosecutor's office for Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," the brother of the dead president, Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, chairman of the government's Law and Justice party, told Tusk.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk said, reciting to the country's current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
When leaving the headquarters of the prosecutor’s office, a crowd was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN 24, which chanted Donald Tusk! and wished the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski won't scare me."
He does not reproach the prosecutors, he says, but he does not doubt that the justice system should serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, the opposition or people who do not like them, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was interrogated for the second time.
The Prime Minister was questioned at the Prosecutor’s Office for the second time, this time the questioning was supposed to be about the misconduct in the autopsies of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, the bodies in the coffins were exchanged.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there had to be some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
“Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk something very important in the EU,” Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski told Catholic television.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk’s chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said that he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but did not take it into account.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
Even then, he did not testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many saw his subpoenas as part of an apparent attempt by the Polish government and PiS chief Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor’s Office in Poland is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor General.
The call for questioning came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but in vain to prevent, among other things, during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk’s mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlov<0xC3><0xA1> protested alone.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n also left Warsaw behind.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the House of Representatives from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It comes from a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared an update and is currently in the process of commenting.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted for MPs abroad.
“Since the last amendment of the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists,” the ministry explains.
“In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or the level of representation has changed,” the report said.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighboring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press version.
It is their list that is changing by decree.
Four years ago, for example, Czechs could vote at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also abolished its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenya’s Nairobi, Senegal’s capital Dakar and Zambia’s Lusaka.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include the Consulate General in Iraq's Irbil and Chengdu, the capital of China's S'chuan province, since the last parliamentary elections.
Voting tickets will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to elect MPs in polling stations or consulates four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission shall determine by lot the region for which candidates are to be voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when the South Moravian candidates were selected.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was chosen.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people voted, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later there were 8,222.
Ten,571 voters attended the early parliamentary elections four years ago.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Recall Racist Lynching
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove past the watching residents of Monroe, Georgia, and curled towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before a car with four black passengers and a white driver could get to the bridge, a group of white men with guns was behind it.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled out of the cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
'We want that n--and Roger! 'shouted the man.
"Bring it to me!"
The silence is interrupted by the roar of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is just a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a rope over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge regularly to reconstruct that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been tried for the murders yet.
“It’s a wonder that there hasn’t been one person arrested in all these years — even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” Tyrone Brooks, who helps reconstruct the event, said in a statement.
"It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic challenge to take place, reminding the Monroe community each year that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.”
On July 27, 1946, a medical examiner covered up one of the bodies of the lynching victims at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both reasons for lynching – politics and sex – were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, by a decision of the Supreme Court, residents of the black state of Georgia were granted the right to participate for the first time in the elections scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election that the FBI said Roger Malcolm, a black farmer, was supposed to stab Barnett Hester, the owner of the white-skinned land, during a skirmish, allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, Hester was said to have associated with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her to a different state.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, then a major white-skinned landowner, filed a $600 bail on Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their return from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects blocked their way.
"As it turned out, the murders were planned and organized by Harrison," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement, who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made a brief statement on the matter.
"It was a massacre for the sake of the right to vote," he said.
“The murders had a clear undertone for all black locals: ‘This is how you’ll end up if you register and go vote.’”
The annual reenactment of the event at Moore’s Ford Bridge has been organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Her performance is figurative, engaging and concise, showing a deep-seated racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even harder to distract, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hidden in each of us,” Greene said.
"But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I've been through."
The main rehearsals of this year's reconstruction began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad because it's against who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history on a regular basis, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcolm, then Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcolm argues with Hester and accuses him of having slept with his wife.
"Get out of my land, n---e!"
Rascona can't be.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every actor of black skin) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
'No, 'said Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites used to say 'n-r' in that tone."
"Exactly," said one of the black-skinned actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of convergence.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be made for four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word on N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
Against the backdrop of all this, about a dozen spectators wiped sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are almost the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, many of them from nearby.
Each of them endures the local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks in the crowd leads them to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up to this point, the murders could have been viewed with distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is horrifying.
With the last words of the song, Greene invites a crowd watching the bodies to be inspected.
The children kneel to the victims' heads, watch the fake blood and the immobile bodies and whisper something in their ear.
'They're not dead, 'said the little boy.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually he is overwhelmed with emotion.
"That's all right," one of the women whispered.
“We know you’re against the role.
But you had a reason for it.”
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is excited to talk about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could scarcely find words to express her feelings about today's performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those disgusting things... people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “it’s just called a police fight.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning the performance for the next year.
“Reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
"If we don't learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and do not study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it.
I love the instructions for use.
A friend of mine says that the instructions for use read only the scumbag.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia I remember the times long ago, where the instructions for using anything was rather a rare phenomenon.
For example, my first turntable contained only one paper, which contained hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some components, all of which had some secret markings.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that paper to a shaman who was not afraid to unscrew the back plate.
With a grin he advised me what the paper with the labyrinth of lines was suitable for.
Yes, it was a habitual aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
Playfully he found a disengaged wire and allowed me to listen again to expensive vinyl cakes.
New times have brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply stuck to a sliced grapefruit, required about ten pictures.
Particularly good was the sketch with a description of how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-piece and another procedure was simply not possible.
To give it, on the contrary, required considerable effort with the need to break off certain plastic components.
My contempt for the instructions ended with my Seat Leon self-propelled vehicle.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among others, the replacement of the blinker bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in total and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right went to replace really only in three steps.
1. Remove the cover.
2. Screw the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. put the cover on.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of placing the battery cover.
At first, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the inside of the car, I would measure some spring, a screw with which the cover could be easily removed, and then I would be guided by points 1-3 of the economical author of the service book.
A footbridge error.
The cover had no room, no room, not even for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was further enhanced by my wife's entry into the garage, which was caused by the roar and the words which she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked.
My response took about 90 seconds, but if I skip the vulgar terms, there are only two published words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why does it take you so long?" she risked a sentence that might be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
Slowly I explained the problem to her, with the main emphasis on the procedure of torture of the author of the manual, where the blessing with a burning iron on the hand that wrote the manual, and then her kidnapping, so that she could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the wide range of instructions Hammer on the witch, including his commissional up.
"Why don't we unmount the box?" said the woman, unmounting the battery.
In pure desperation, this happened, and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just recovering from a collapsed state after a check by two officials of the State Drug Control Service.
I know him as a well-balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories in an unexcited voice.
"Imagine I was fined for not having my hand-washing instructions posted," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got the whole problem out of him, which was that above the washbasin in the toilet of patients there is no picture how to wash their hands.
His argument to the commission clerk that adults are usually able to wash their hands and that it is unnecessary to use pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people, did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the soapy hands with running water was a primitive act at the level of the Cro-Magnon, that the modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
So it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but at the end it is joyful to find out that a person washed his hands exactly as ordered by the hosover from the S<0xC3><0x9A>KL.
Finally, I have to say that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there the problem will not arise, with urination, due to certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang two instructions.
The problem remains the pictograms, because to create a perfect procedure means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse some outrage among the prudent visitor of the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that throughout his life he has wiped the corresponding hole by a completely wrong procedure.
Pearson to lay off 3,000 more employees and cut dividends in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of layoffs, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur in late 2018 and early 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to revive declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in base sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a Herat mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement Tuesday that the explosion occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by “a local person with a homemade explosive device.”
The statement added that all wounded soldiers were out of danger and were at the US military hospital at Bagram air base.
Reporters say the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban has claimed responsibility for the attack.
May 31 killed a major explosion in the city center of more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the US troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops to assist military units and police officers in the country.
Reporters say the suicide attacks, which he has trained in recent weeks, have shaken the public’s confidence in the government, its regulations and especially President Ashraf Ghanin’s reputation.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA has re-examined its decision to postpone the rules of smoking
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to delay the Obama administration’s law ordering states to cut emissions, just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to refer “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it presents the Agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will listen to their views,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced an effort by the EPA to delay ozone standards — which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 of the majority of democracies, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA’s conduct is illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking to circumvent many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama — according to Trump in a bid to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups, who fear the public health impact of emissions.
The EPA says on its website that breathing ozone-containing air "may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r got hit and blood flowed!
This, a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June this year, when this previously unknown singer organized a monstrous event in Czech Republic, at which he hosted such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie B<0xC3><0xAD>l<0xC3><0xA1>, Simona Krainov<0xC3><0xA1> and many others, and the event was moderated by none other than Leo<0xC5><0xA1>.
The purpose was simple, to show yourself to the public and to present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the aforementioned personalities.
But few people already know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubn<0xC3><0xA1>r himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shooting with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it was not without a lot of embarrassment.
The song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticness of the scene, the singer's juice was supposed to indicate a punch in the video clip.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight into his nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, my nose immediately bleeded," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers told each other that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe as to affect the continuation of the next shooting.
The aforementioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record that scene with a punch.
A failed version with blood, however, was not preferred.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko spoke at a meeting about the possibilities of mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room at the ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia - the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion - went down to the hall where he welcomed Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory on the basis of a unanimous decision against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime match, both boxers made it to the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?
Good luck."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19:00.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager of Lomachenko Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxing match would be a “perfect test”.
"I'm a former champion of the featherweight," Garcia adds.
“I had to gain weight because of the game against Broner (67 kg), but I’m not that big.
I'm small at 63 kg.
I would like to return to the light weight category.
Lomachenko has to gain weight again to gain weight... then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Why not do it to them.”
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this game."
Klimas made a request for payment for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his debut in a light weight at the end of this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match against the winner of the duel Jorge Linares vs. Luke le Campbell in the 23rd edition of the Forum.
"The game should be a pay-per-view style, that's what fans want," said Garcia, who later said he was open to broadcasting the game through a TV station that would come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will get that kind of attention.
We’ll wait for the right opportunity...”
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "amazing boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not let Garcia’s praise sway when he said that the champion of the three divisions of Riverside looks “very slow... sorry Mike, but you’re thinking about knockout.”
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both fighters said they felt the tension rising in front of each other's duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game gets so much attention.
And I'm very happy to put it in the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.”
It's going to be a great match."
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car has now been found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search began for them, but without success.
In the end, the police stopped the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in the uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver at the bottom of the Volga River in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>eboksary in Chuvash.
Only thanks to the documents left in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, and without them, it would have taken much longer for the police to find out the identity of those found.
The couple was last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who took the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe that the death of the young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be made public upon its conclusion.
Latest results of tests to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of assessing their age, show that over 80 percent of people were interviewed as over 18 years of age, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started conducting new tests at the beginning of this year.
The aim of the method is to make a more accurate assessment of applicants in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases to the investigation, and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged the interviewee to be “possibly over 18 years of age”.
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the interviewee was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
Tests are only available if the age of the interviewee is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in the running and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
A higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that "the subject is 18 years of age or older".
The Svenska Dagbladet newspaper investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the interviewee said he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of age determination, which includes wisdom teeth x-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-ray scientists, was also criticized.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which the person went through puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements to assess age are correct.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can't determine the age with precision, we shouldn't pretend otherwise," he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision by saying: "In general, it can be said that the risk of misjudgment of a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the interviewee is just below the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico over the phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, US President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the US and Mexico.
Trump said in the interview that the funding will somehow settle, although he admitted that it will have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
Immediately in his first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically rebuked Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto for being critical of his plan to build a wall.
He described the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government would never pay for the wall.
“You can’t say that to the press,” Trump said in an interview on January 27, threatening to cut ties with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
They say the funding will somehow come up and eventually it will work out well.
“But if you’re going to say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to meet with you gentlemen anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
He called the wall the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it may be the most important thing.
An executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took power.
Mexico rejects the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometre wall, which has escalated relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief said the conversation was ridiculous.
To this conclusion, he was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in persons from detention facilities in the Pacific island states.
At first, Trump thought the deal was stupid, but later he accepted it.
“You can certainly say that this is not a deal you’ve made, but you’ll have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost jovial, for example, when Trump praised it as a good idea for Australia to refuse to accept refugees arriving in boats.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
“I hate receiving these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in prison now.
“They’re not going to be great people going to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In the interview, he also noted that the refugee could become a bomber from Boston in five years.
At the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen, often several in one day.
In the end, he called Turnbull the least pleasant conversation of the whole day.
Before ending it, he said he had had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Rana's killer was executed before the mob.
Her father was also watching.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi abducted the girl, took her to his father's house, raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body, which he then dumped near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected the entire country, which is facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of the thousand-headed mob, who came together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media his feelings after his execution.
I feel like I'm being reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day of my life.
The other members of the family were also present, together with the crowd shouting the slogan "Long live justice".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was pulled out.
The police tied him to his stomach.
One of the officers turned his weapon against him and fired from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd was celebrating every blow that had been fired.
Mr. al-Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have triumphed," he added.
I stood in Sana's Liberation Square waiting for my daughter's killer to be executed.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would fall into a hateful frenzy, seizing the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by a court administered by the Shia Huthi.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes after his arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge decided to sentence him to death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl's disappearance on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the Wound.
"Our family has no enemies and the wounds that carried Ran's body were terrible," he said.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer's parents who suspected their son of a horrific crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where she was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the neighborhood, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read out the investigation record to the crowd in order to calm them down.
The accused seemed to have no regrets about his actions.
Just before serving his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convict only glanced at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many recordings were made on the Internet by the crowd.
West Virginia Governor Announces Change of Political Party
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday evening at a meeting of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," the governor of Justice said.
"Today, after a long prayer and reflection, I announce to you ... today, as a citizen of West Virginia, I say to you that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor."
The crowd of spectators exploded in joy.
"Tomorrow I will join the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you that it's time to jump into another match."
Trump has already promised people at a rally in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes magazine is the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his assets is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday evening saying: “The run over of the Governor of Justice is another blow to the democratic party that puts obstacles in our way, instead of contributing to the upliftment of our country.”
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and has the least legislative power in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is the last straw for an already miserable leaderless party that is in vain seeking to find positive and unifying news,” RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's 'sincere' apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for sincerely apologizing for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin told the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s expulsion from the world of sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way."
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which came into effect in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported doping of its athletes.
“I think we have seen a very honest response and presentation today,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today was a very successful day and we have advanced to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendations of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment that was imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
"Our goal has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest athletes," he said.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begins on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag, who have met the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before being allowed back.
Drug testing is still unsatisfactory and excluded coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board presentation.
The CzechTrade state contract was awarded to the company Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov, whose state prosecutes.
The public contract of the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the Pro-Export Agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of CzechTrade issued a public contract for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal for four years.
A total of CZK 30.8 million was awarded to the publishing house Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and prosecuted him on the run.
Savov fled to the United Kingdom and the Czech Republic demanded his extradition.
The case was brought to the attention of the server Aktualno.cz.
According to the original criteria of CzechTrade, 60 percent of the offered price and the remaining 40 percent of the beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project, were to decide on the award of the contract.
It was the second criterion that helped Savov’s company.
According to information Dotyk.cz received 100 points in all sub-quality criteria.
That is what pushed her in the end before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta operated with an amount of CZK 404,900 per month, the VLM offered CZK 324,350.
However, unlike Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta, it received a sub-average score of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
Tendru was also attended by the consulting company BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the server Aktu<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xA1>.cz, belongs to the publishing house Economia.
VLM has raised several objections to the outcome of the tender, arguing that its assessment is considered unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, they decided to contest the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
He believes that CzechTrade acted in violation of the law.
"The appellant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor of the public contract on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favoring the participant Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta, a.s., at the expense of the appellant and other suppliers," reads the application for the opening of proceedings submitted to the CCA this week, which was published by the server Aktualno.
According to the General Director and Chairman of the Board of VLM Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma, the scoring of the selection committee appears to be an unreliable and 100% assessment of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the competitors unlikely and suspicious," he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts prior to their conclusion.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Public Procurement Bulletin.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its progress," media representative of the agency <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD> told Dotyk.cz.
Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta reacted with a statement, according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia intervened in the competition with an article in Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD>.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact has been stated in that article.
In the tender, she could be helped by the fact that she was the one who provided editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Kuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov is accused by the police of tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions of his companies, which caused the Czech state alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK for its release since 2014.
According to Savov, the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, under whose influence the Mafra publishing house falls, is behind his criminalization.
Last year, the London court rejected Savov’s appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any notification from the United Kingdom regarding the acquisition of legal force of the judgment to this day," Prague Public Prosecutor's Office spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1> told Aktualn<0xC3><0xA1>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Mlada fronta, Savov was represented in the company Harvestor Limited based in Cyprus, which controlled the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It should also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist rode down the sidewalks and through the park, ending up in a cot.
The motorcyclist caught the attention of ruthless driving on the streets, sidewalks and park paths in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to drive her in the direction of the Station.
"Police officers followed the man with increased caution through the city, when on one of the side roads behind Mari<0xC3><0xA1>nské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> he failed to drive and drove his motorcycle into the field where he crashed," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k said.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to fly to the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Later, police found out that the motorcyclist did not possess a driver's license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number was sharpened and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test performed on the spot ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result for the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman said.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the funding of European football clubs will not interfere with Neymar’s record transfer from Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain in France.
Any penalties for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules, introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract, and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some financial conditions for Neymar's transfer to France.
Since the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has grown rich in energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into the already-starred football family.
Clubs can spend huge sums to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legitimate sources of income, which allows them to cover the overhead of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he was appointed UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately cheat and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players to build a global brand – suddenly wasn’t so profitable.
Under the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can report losses of up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, is determined to defend a ban on excessive spending.
“The FFP rules still apply and we are committed to strengthening them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount of Neymar’s redemption as a lump sum, it may, for accounting purposes, spread the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million annually over a five-year period.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014, along with Manchester City, which owns Abu Dhabi.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (US$82 million) – which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and ordered to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is looking out for teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Thus, although the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the invoicing of the amount.
A similar measure was taken by UEFA in 2014 after it decided that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
According to some reports, part of Neymar’s income in PSG could be paid by the organizing committee of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and Qatar’s 2022 World Cup officials denied the fathom that Neymat should become an ambassador for the World Cup in football and that such a manoeuvre would be easily revealed by UEFY officials.
Previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to insiders, UEFA has not launched any investigation into Neymar’s transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wanted to remain anonymous as he was not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The most recent published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would break FFP rules.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ by the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, citing the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's position on the club's funding.
“It’s a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as the owner of the club becomes the owner, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult, because the state can have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan midfielder Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder started the game against Red Star, came up with a few goals, but his teammates did not aim for black.
The summer team, pumped by new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening doubles in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything after the match in Belgrade?
After the goal, we had to score four goals, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, we wanted to raise our self-esteem so that we had something to keep away from in the next matches.
We had a chance.
We have to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why didn't Sparta manage to get into the match so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The combinations of the opponents were much better than ours.
We did not get anything, in half time we fired maybe once.
Of course, that’s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push your opponents into such positions more often.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the layout?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We only played three matches and the line-up is still changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the ideal 11 to sit down.
Is it encouraging for you to have already played parts of two matches in a row?
These are just parts of the game.
I don’t know how I’m going to develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta somehow decided, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
Fans came back in large numbers, but they left in embarrassment.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit again, as well as with Bohemka.
I'm so sorry we can't make them happy with a better performance.
Show them something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember that kind of visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups be at least an advantage for the league?
So far, we are fighting with ourselves, we are playing, so it is not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur is to serve ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of the businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tom<0xC3><0xA1>n, who is scheduled to serve ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The estimated damage amounts to CZK 645 million.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the judiciary had violated his fundamental rights, and that the findings of the courts in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and Olomouc were incomplete.
Constitutional judges, however, called the complaint unfounded, the CTK found from the court's database.
The court is not another court of appeal.
“It cannot, as a fourth instance, assess factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the ordinary courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,” the resolution said.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been final since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Olomouc Supreme Court.
At that time, Toman was in custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also in custody at the time of the <0xC3><0x9A>S decision.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which, according to the verdict, corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as the Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
<0xC5><0xA0>koda 645 million crowns was created only for the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage exceeded one billion according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Servis did not include all the invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies it has traded with have ties to businessman Radomir Vyb<0xC3><0xAD>ral, who has been sentenced to 13 years in prison by the justice system for VAT machinations in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
"Summer to Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic both for characters from the famous 80s; and for the filthy 90s (when geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and of course also for the modern era, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudy made the project bigger.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the franchisor's point of view, it looks like someone's out of breath.
The series "First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well - not only because of absurd humor (an example is the story of the emergence of a talking can with vegetables, which was told by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors deviated from the main funny point - middle-aged actors playing teenage horny kids - and could not make fun of previous events.
The sequel to “Ten Years Later,” in which adults play adults, doesn’t put so much pressure on the emotional plane, and satire is sporadic at times, including a parody of the 1990s thrillers as “Hand on the Cradle.”
At one point, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbooks, roller skates and “a lot of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
The kind-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn’t moved beyond his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupated Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Particularly fun is watching the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the movie Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now an old pepper.
Francis could be triggered by moments of random insanity, such as the return of the Seven Up series, until he reaches the logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” when the entire group will go to the premiere of “Summers to Survive.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to another type of nostalgia: Cold War revivalism in the series "Such Normal Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde: No Pity" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scene clash.
The comedy of the creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is to act as a television production: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Street, who have been added to the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, that’s not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (like policemen watching chess on TV - a parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan-masked killer - and that's what it looks like.
Six long episodes are too stretchy and comedy moments are not enough.
With a shorter track, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat men swallow hamburgers stacked on a large pile.
The clear message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can turn everything into food and an orgy.
The inventive Romanian creators were not mistaken: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not expect the lifting of the ban from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation (IAAF) at a congress in London has confirmed an extension of the international ban on Russian racers due to a state-backed doping program.
Voting in the venue of the World Cup, which starts on Friday, was as expected very clear.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as noted before the congress by the head of the special investigation group IAAF Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been questioned, and coaches with a tainted reputation still work in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is still not fully operational.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF Chairman Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes lost, among other things, last year's Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban, 19 Russians will participate in the upcoming World Cup, who have already proven that they have been tested outside the Russian anti-doping system for a long time.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colors and in case of victory they will not play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England to keep interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, followed by sluggish economic growth and a weakening of inflation, which has stifled speculation of sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “in the background” in connection with maintaining the interest rate – despite squeezing family budgets.
Political officials of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England voted six to two in favor of keeping the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of raising the interest rate supported a weak economic growth supported by a weak increase.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecasted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that family budget cuts would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
The bank also indicated that there should be growth over the next few years as a result of inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that rents on movables should grow more than expected in the financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, whose task was to support the economy, which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Futures Financing Plan, which will offer low-cost subsidies to banks, should start to apply from next February, although the Bank of England said it would now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Just before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household incomes and the burden on consumption.”
On the subject of rates, the bank said it would need to “tighten the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “at a higher rate” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The bank lowered its growth forecasts for this year and next year, compared to 1.9% and 1.7% predicted in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after a disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it should increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight comfort for households hit by rising inflation and miserable wage increases, the bank said, adding that the situation would worsen before the increase.
The report further states that monetary policy “cannot prevent” income cuts in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise “significantly” towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy should also grow thanks to strong interest in British goods thanks to a weak pound, which compensates for a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were lowered to 0.025% last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that the full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Before the bank's decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was exerting increasing pressure on households. Three political officials demanded an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank saying it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2% target was “completely” due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start competing for contracts with a good outlook towards the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who are running out of existing contracts and re-mortgages - there are no-fee options on offer, as well as low rates that are gaining popularity."
NHS Prescribes Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
As of September, patients will have access to ‘transformative’ treatments to prevent HIV following a decision by the Supreme Court to fund the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill taken before sex, which reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the health service to approximately 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
The NSH agreed to fund a trial period after an appeals court upheld a Supreme Court decision last year stating that the NHS had the funds to pay PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, accepted the NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Other clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine administered before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among vulnerable patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient’s body to prevent infection.
These drugs can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Tested patients include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not treated successfully.
The clinics will designate eligible participants who will sign their consent to participate in testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with GP in the UK can also apply to their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS of England signed a contract this week to distribute drugs after receiving an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It’s another milestone in a more than 30-year effort to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, the NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will improve the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The number one priority must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is accessible to every patient.
We now have the PrEP trial drug at our disposal and we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of contracting HIV.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to end the spread of HIV in society."
Living on a high foot: mezzanine and smart design turned this small apartment at Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment on the Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of Queen Anne’s smart terrace, it is a striking example of a modern design that makes the most of the space available.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I ran into this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him and nodded at him the same day.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
"I longed for a high ceiling, large windows, and a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based design studio Duck & Shed and used the nearly four-metre ceiling to create a home that was not just a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such height that two gaps would creep over each other - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine on which one could walk upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not only about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room of the old copper window frames in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirrored furniture in gold, silver lines and a retro chandelier by Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing cutlery and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of significantly more space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique about this solution is the folding door.
"We had to solve the technical side," Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is fitted with counterweights so that it can be unloaded very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is a living space - or a valuation of your property," Erfan said.
“A real estate agent basically calculates the estimated price when entering the apartment based on the living area.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while maintaining quality materials that give the room a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
"You won't love the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won’t win your heart.”
As it turned out, quality design and an increase in living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you can choose to stay in the end.
The United States is splitting up.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has announced a travel ban for its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated and announced a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all 50 states.
The issue is that California has banned spending state money on travel of its citizens to eight other states, such as Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
“California is strongly for LGBT people and considers any expression of disapproval of LGBT lifestyles to be discrimination.
However, Tennessee has passed a Conscience Restrictions Act, which states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the treatment of LGBT patients has no obligation to provide it to them, but has a duty to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws under which religious charities that have given birth-to-adopt children from their mothers are not obliged to give adoptions to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the financing of travel of its citizens to the eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposiums, for example, in Texas paid by their universities, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get federal grants to travel, but it’s absurd for the federal government to fund citizens’ travel from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its parliament has passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s policies of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California because of this.
He's imposing them as retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to any State of the Union which would order a similar travel ban on another State for any reason.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience reservation?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he offer only beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pork under penalty, when there are enough butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system lies in the fact that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust internal, domestic policy in non-federal powers according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California, and Texas and seven other states want California to be California too!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately sought tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of live and let live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever show moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know of a situation in American history in which states deliberately did so because of political issues, except in one case.
Even in times of civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South was on the side of segregation, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1950s, the political cause was slavery, and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is nevertheless toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue democratic states and red republican states is deepening, and the US is mentally disengaging.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critics received a greasy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny has been fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year’s presidential election.
The court fined him for urging people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
In the past two months, Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests and announced that he plans to run for head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is widely expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for urging people to demonstrate through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them off the judge's salary later," the Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the verdict to be politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, was also imposed by the court on Thursday on two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure in the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in every way possible in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to a five-year suspended sentence for robbing the Kirovles forestry company.
In May, the appeals court upheld the verdict.
The verdict is so final, it prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth over $500 million.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are dragging on one of Victoria’s most expensive properties worth more than $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in the Toorak estate, only three rooms away from his younger brother Paul, who brought the dispute over joint property and commercial assets to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but a sharp dispute is constantly denied before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, his brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
At this point, the Westco Jeans family was founded, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million.
The De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and business centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who Paul says is “a significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the company’s assets.
Court records state that Colin owns $316 million worth of properties, while Paul manages $176 million worth of properties.
For Paul, the division of property and funds became problematic.
“Colin’s proposal came out in my eyes significantly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a court statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to him, Colin cut off Paul.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous statement, Colin said he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails, and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding with lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and attorneys from both parties.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicacies since the 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his final year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to sons would take place in a good way.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said that Mark was compensated in the amount of $10 million and Luke in the amount of $26 million when he left.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark “were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and Colin’s best friend, stated in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin responded only via a text message in which he stated that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, “I have nothing to add.”
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the case to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a statement in court that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy if he saw our current situation," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a successful solution."
On Friday, all hope was out of sight.
“Our disputes will be resolved soon in court,” Colin wrote.
A bucket in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
Drivers of public transport pack water and summer clothes.
In the nursery school Na Chodovci in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The nursery has been reconstructed and the trees planted do not provide much shade yet.
There's no swimming pool, but teachers shower their kids in the fog.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where blinds and curtains are removed.
The air is trying to cool down with an air purifier because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so in this period we should not even have open operation," said Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, kindergarten director.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to her the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows close and we have on the southern sides of the blinds to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hr<0xC3><0xA1>zi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have grown trees on the land, so we are under them.
"We have a beautiful nut there, there's a table underneath, and we do things there," said Barbora Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1>, kindergarten director.
Teachers try to go to the woods with their children, where there is more coolness.
Children wet caps and on the program have various games with water.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Jitka Vilimovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, the kindergarten director at Novoborsk<0xC3><0xA1> Street in Prosek, Prague, also said that teachers try to keep their children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
She goes out in the morning and then after 3 p.m.
Every child should have a head covering.
Teachers also remind children that they should have a drink.
They can choose, for example, low-sweetened tea or diluted juice, and in the garden they have a drink with water.
Every day they also have to eat vegetable salad and to snack always fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes bring them parents.
"Perhaps today a mother brought here about ten kilos of watermelon for the children," added Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
In most cases, the cabins of tram and bus drivers are air-conditioned, DPP spokesman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In addition to the cabins of some trams, they are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tram tracks have not been seriously damaged so far.
A small damage occurred in the loop in Hostivar.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that drivers have a sufficient amount of drinks available.
“Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roadways,” said <0xC5><0x98>ehkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In roadways and at some exchange points, employees have the so-called "contemporaries" available, which produce cooled soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
“They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts,” she added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic destroyed 108 of them, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters were mainly engaged in fighting fire.
"Fires in the natural environment and also those associated with harvest work are predominant," firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said in a statement.
Even the evening weather changes did not bring relief to the firefighters, when the heat was replaced in a number of places by storms and storms.
In the wake of the storms, firefighters went to 236 strikes.
In particular, it was the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They intervened the most in the Central Bohemian region," Zaoralov<0xC3><0xA1> continues.
However, firefighters were also needed in Stvol<0xC3><0xAD>nky in the Czech Republic, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures also assigned work to Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances drove out to dozens of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the carnage.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odourless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and a feeling of fainting.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the contaminated room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb President Trump’s flow of information — including news reports on television — in the hopes of keeping Trump on the line.
Here is a report by Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met on his first day in office with his staff, he outlined a key problem Trump’s White House intends to fix: the wrong information that gets in the President’s hands.
Kelly told employees that he had to personally approve all information - whether on paper or by word of mouth - because the president could make better decisions based on the right information."
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at Trump’s control and media coverage.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades — and now that he’s sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reports, it was appropriate to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign advisor, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico said: “The key to keeping Trump’s tweets in check – according to at least six former campaign organizers – is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praises him.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if they weren’t checked.
The tweets that Trump has never sent will most likely never be revealed.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts did not go in vain.
However, no one has yet been able to regularly prevent Trump from raising controversial topics.
Part of this problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to strengthen their agenda by supplanting Trump’s materials — which may or may not be reliable — that support their view of the world.
In May, the Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the inclination of advisers to submit questionable information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angry to negative media reports, especially leaks, and seeks to find their origin.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone planted a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — that accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever expelled from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claim with any evidence; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dropped them.
Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to administer and document the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to push through the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness doesn’t just disappear, and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors will certainly complicate Kelly's mission.
Tourists are negotiating a ditch and a return to the ‘Millionaires’ quarter
Several of the most movable homeowners in England’s West Midland County are once again settling with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to reclaim the fields behind their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field on a thriving street in the town of Solihull, dubbed the “millionaire neighborhood.”
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being deported in May. They were not afraid of the moat, which was dug on the spot under the orders of the authorities in order to prevent their invasion.
Tactical group found gaps in defense and penetrated the field with the caravans unprotected gap, which served as a way.
The angry residents of the neighborhood attacked the Solihull city council, saying it was “unable to solve the problem”.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “They took the place on Monday night after they were moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they were throwing stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
Last night there were more, and today there will be more.'
She added: ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board of directors deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there were even more of them, and this time they brought their horses with them.'
A spokesman for Solihull said: “We are aware of the unauthorised stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal conduct to the police at 101.
We will get the overall picture that we will present in court.'
A woman’s husband was hit by a car in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the injured R<0xC3><0xB3>bert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and the plane was under constant supervision of Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
According to JOJ TV, Robert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD> had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being transported to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized facility at one of Bratislava’s hospitals.
The economic analyst is married to Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xA1> from NOVA.
She did not want to comment on the incident.
The couple has three children together.
Italians toughen up fight against NGO rescue ships with immigrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue ships arriving off the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean Sea unless NGOs sign new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be difficult for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organisation, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the case on charges brought by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
“For us, saving lives is and always will be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones,” the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on all the current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.”
Italian authorities have been tracking the Jugend Rettet's Iuventa since October.
Her crew is suspected of transporting migrants on board the ship, which were handed over to them directly by human traffickers, repeatedly.
According to the prosecutor’s file, at least one meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to Italian media.
The crew of the ship is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, Malta’s MOAS and Spain’s Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organisation said Thursday that the new rules are not necessary but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or impediment" to rescue operations.
Doctors Without Borders (MSF), a Nobel Prize-winning organization, has also rejected the new code of conduct.
Minniti, meanwhile, has been told that the sharp decline in migrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.
“In recent days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe.
Unashamed Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Silicone and cellulite climbed from her overcoat!
Hot summer days are completely tempting to take on only the most necessary things that will cover the most intimate parties.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> does the opposite.
At the afternoon meeting in the Prague Zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all who have to do with TV Prima, just swarmed, she wrapped her body in a mini-overall.
And just a few normal movements, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also her buttocks.
Overal had cut himself in half many times, and he had to cut himself up so high that he had to adjust it all the time.
There was no need for the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Sending Text Messages Calling for Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter will serve 15 months of a two-year prison sentence and then spend five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June for the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father told the court on Thursday: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at large until a decision was made.
She was threatened with up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a creamy blouse, Carter stood on the spot with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped, and her eyes pointing to the ground.
"Her conduct killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
"She ended his life to relieve herself.
She could not accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter’s attorney said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder has no significant impact on her performance."
The plaintiff read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy: “There will not be a single day that I will not mourn the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me – I take care of his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever.”
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was being "stalked" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of a person I’ve been seeing since I was born is a pain that I will carry with me for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have a law in force to punish a person who is aiding another person's suicide, thus setting a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat poisoned with carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case caught the nation’s attention after Carter’s text messages instigated suicide were published.
"For example, hang yourself, jump out of the building, or stab yourself, I don't care," said the text messages that Carter sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him: “You have to do it Conrad” and “Just put the generator on and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy’s death and ordered her to refrain from any press comments.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi will adapt up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to a sharp response
Just a day before Audi’s announcement, carmaker BMW said it would offer its customers software updates in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes there are “more smart options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s headquarters – that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday it would adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to a large extent in order to comply with the CO2 regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which in order to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which reduced the amount of emissions issued during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department of engine development at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former Zaccheo manager Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he can face legal proceedings in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation of German police into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emissions limits - and thus widened the accusations Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could have a detrimental impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car makers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane crash-landed on the beach.
A man and a girl were killed.
The accident occurred on Praia de S<0xC3><0xA3>o Jo<0xC3><0xA3>o beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just before landing just above people sunbathing on the beach.
Some people from the beach allegedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people were unable to escape from the machine.
According to local media, a 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane hit them and they were dead," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both of whom escaped from the accident alive and were taken by police for questioning.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unfinished, although it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it is unfinished, it is constantly being repaired.
And it can't be built any further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the Hradec D11 motorway.
The construction of the next section was stopped by the Children of Earth movement for at least several months.
We East Bohemians get the highway in pieces, like when they cut salami.
The wheel is cut and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite streams of trucks run directly through the towns of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or N<0xC3><0xA1>chod, which is not how to rationally get around.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was commissioned in 2008, that is, an incredible nine years ago.
Since then, there's been no knock.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of unfinished section near Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové began to be built recently, and on other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>, an archaeological survey began with the idea that the construction would begin at the end of this year, you could hear loud bangs of pins in eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that it will not be built this year.
And maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has given way.
Children of the Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They challenged the decision on the building permit in its entirety.
They shall request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Hradec Magistrate, the Ministry of Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Railway Authority.
So far, from D11 we come near the village with the eloquent name Pogreba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just go down the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to be placed in the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
Scary, constantly blocked road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own funeral home.
What do the children of the earth want?
What is the nature of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Provence lavender is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the region of southeastern France, but now they are threatened by climate change.
Lavender declines as a result of dry climates and harmful insects, which causes dismay on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in the spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
The cicadas and locusts carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates are also at fault."
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil that is produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is, of course, less."
A possible solution may be more efficient distribution of water and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
Murder of journalist highlights growing threats in Mexico
The staff of Riodoce meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the riots taking place in the Sinaloa area, with organized criminals, corrupt officials, and unrelenting drug wars.
But today, under the pressure of recent events, they meet mainly for their own safety.
They learn the importance of changing their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: take your children with you to an office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009 or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals, and allies.
They ask journalists to name every word - no evidence is needed, just imagination and preconception.
To choose them from what - drug traffickers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are constantly growing: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, there have been at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is co-founder of the periodical Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and working as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is noticeable, although his presence is pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the middle finger points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a T-shirt with a photo of Valdez with a smile on his face, glasses on his nose and nose.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has so far charged two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that take place each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, which makes it very rare for journalists to be put on trial.
Journalists from Riodoce insist on reporting on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; despite the fact that they are devastated and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a vision of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"If we don't get more information, we can't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of the Riodoces in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to get away a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds, apparently due to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then boarded his car and crashed him not far from the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors seem to be spreading fast in Culiacan.
In Valdez's case, however, there is a suspicious silence.
Since Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n’s arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlegrounds in the country as rival factions try to fill an empty space.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with elaborate two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “ truce” means that a drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes through which drugs travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and director of Riodoce, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Peace may have angered the sons; the suspected gang members bought all the copies of the newspaper the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after confiscating other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the magazine Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his $50 stock and found together with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a newspaper without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Over time, Riodoce gained a reputation for brave and truthful reporting; newspapers began to prosper.
Journalists like to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for her coverage of Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said in the award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” Valdez said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist — or play dumb.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do in the face of death...why didn’t you say what was going on?’”
The employees of Riodoce miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and indiscriminate language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar across from the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: was this routine to blame for his death?
His death also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job best and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you mess with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing sites."
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel like something's wrong here, get your hands off me.
The problem is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, “smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the Javier thing happened.”
The old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where the Riodoc employees meet; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which governments bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief in front of a 40-degree heatwave in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-story building in the burgher district of Culiacan.
Journalists are joking about whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law-enforcers who the government says are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last ventured into mountainous areas that essentially control drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week’s agenda.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Sinaloa.
They are also sanctioned for suspicious government expenditures that took place in the hometown of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings at one of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n's most luxurious restaurants, just a block away from the prosecutor's office.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were careful when they were about to write about what every inhabitant of the city knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read out from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the entire last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in senior positions.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaqu<0xC3><0xAD>n's sons, "El Chapo" Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n, escaped an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez’s column, which was the best source of information about kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office turned into a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several signs and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor's office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western part of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n state.
The only body found was a burnt body, according to the authorities, based on DNA analysis, it was Adame.
The activity of journalists is increasing all over the country, many of them organizing protests and snooping on the sidewalks and buildings of the “SOS press”.
Bojorquez is on a visit to Washington, D.C., seeking international support and justice for Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “circumvented” by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists die not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the request of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
Media watchdog Articulo 19 has blamed more than half of all attacks on police and public officials.
"You're going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you," Ramirez said.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Mac<0xC3><0xAD>as six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
There was a keyboard and headphones next to the decapitated head.
Some branches have decided to cease operations, such as the newspaper El Norte, based near the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the March murder of the reporter Miroslava Breach.
The others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce's employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people were killed in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The war is escalating, as many of the syndicate’s members have promised.
Journalists publish this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a single day goes by and the opening title changes again.
The sound of police sirens indicates another shooting.
Bojorquez casts a fleeting glance at the police patrol to see if they are paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their periodical - whose middleman is the eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all Riodoc employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, no matter how frightening.
Researchers have now uncovered the findings of the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have dubbed the ‘Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs’ — have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were preserved to such a high degree that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of his scaly skin and reported that the dinosaur had a “problematic past”.
According to an article in the journal Current Biology, it is “the most preserved armoured dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described him with the words “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armoured eggplant is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it further.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
'Just close your eyes a little and you'll believe he's asleep,' said work manager Caleb Brown and a naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur species, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
Studying his skin, the researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and resembling a walking tank — was likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a camouflage system used by many of today's animals.
Experts say that this allowed him to merge better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The camouflage system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May. It is currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours diligently uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of the scales and armor all over the body.
They discovered a method of masking commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising, as Borealopelta’s size far exceeds that of today’s animals using the same technique.
Thus, it is possible that dinosaurs were so many predators that evolution gave preference to camouflage over confrontation.
Many modern camouflage animals—for example, deer, zebras, or girdles—are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
“The presentation of the huge and heavily armored dinosaur illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the dinosaur's skin probably had a reddish-brown color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for more information about its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to track down its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur after his death fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank to the bottom.
Alberta was the same climate as present-day Florida at the time, and the rivers and oceans stretched much further inland than they are today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time preserved in three dimensions, so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did in the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just need to close your eyes a little, and it seems like you're just asleep.'
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods walked the Earth, carnivorous dinosaurs, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
The researchers, whose latest findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is also complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The animal averaged 5 meters in length and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two 50 cm spikes protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that washed it out into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the find seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armored plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
At his side lies his right front foot with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his feet.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a native of St. Louis sat down on an Airbnb bed and walked through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across the contribution of a high school student.
"Police have just shot an 18-year-old young man whose body is still lying on the street," it said.
She was surprised that no one else had written this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah constantly retweeted her wall posts.
The St. Louis rapper tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old man shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photograph of Brown's body lying helplessly on the street, from which no one had taken him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death, however, was nothing new to her and her community.
She put down her phone to return to him the evening she watched tweets about people gathering at Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim’s father and held a sign saying, “Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!”
She was watching live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand, and at his other end a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand, aimed at the crowd and shouted, "I'll kill you all... animals."
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight, and the next day she went home.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to go to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and resistance, of strength and perseverance told from the perspective of the people living in the community, who take to the streets and demand answers.
On her way to Ferguson, Ferrell had a dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral headdress - about a topic they had discussed many times before - "about the experience with blacks".
"Remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?" he recalls.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that's not right."
"It didn't feel like I wasn't taking her with me," Ferrell later said.
"Today's events are the climax... of what has happened in the past.
She must have known and seen it with her own eyes and grown up in it.
It needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time it had to learn the difference between the different layers of experience with blacks and what we have to do to free ourselves.
Even though I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from any other black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
Arriving in Ferguson, she was the first stop on South Florissant Road across from the police department, which became the base of activists who were expecting police officer Darren Wilson to say he might be involved in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for others.
Together they prepared food in sachets and helped to distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new type of activism began to emerge.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of Minority Student Nurses Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, a later co-director of the documentary, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said he and cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “just document” the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used?”
This kind of skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money from pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often ignored, and we wanted to change that.”
Folayan has already partnered with co-director Damon Davis, a renowned local artist who deals with the subject of death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also intensified Ferrell and, along with six other locals, followed by the Whose Streets? team in the years following Brown's assassination.
"Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it's our testimony," Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because I will be represented in the same way."
While the aim of the document was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences — in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a rescue leader, but about bringing the community closer together,” Folayan said — it turned out that she is the most open to participation in filming.
"Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking about the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
"But I realized that in order to do this job and to enslave black people, I had to open up."
In addition, Ferrell’s story highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — who created a social media campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the murder of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 — call themselves freaks.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand for the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events.”
Folayana agrees with this statement, adding that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not just an affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main character of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence that she's the one in the front lines, because living at these intersections in the skin of a black weirdo woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV station cameras cleared their positions, but the heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
She described the social and political atmosphere in the area she calls home as a “disorder.”
Still, she hasn’t given up on her commitment since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters arrived and a helicopter helped.
Near <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire ceased to spread around 15:15, with firefighters declaring a third of four possible fire alarms.
According to firefighters spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, the helicopter also helped to extinguish fire from the air.
At 18:00 firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, the fire caused damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combine.
The helicopter, which carried out a total of six drops of water, also helped to extinguish the fire.
"We handed over the place of intervention to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a unit of volunteer firefighters will guard it," Holom<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k said today.
A Becoming Resemblance: The Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery, there are several faces of different skin shades - white, black and gray - suspended from the ceiling on wires. Each of them seems to fall out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from the mouth and hair wipes that Chelsea Manning sent her.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which began on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before his departure from office.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a razor-sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on DNA susceptibility—as well as the many ways DNA can be interpreted—and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, as well as the inherent determinism of these identities.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward Manning, has been talking about considering herself a woman since she was young. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violating six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photos were held by prison staff, and only one low-quality black and white photo leaked to the public, on which Manning, visibly concerned, sits in the driver's seat in the platinum-blonde wig she is now associated with.
In 2015, there were still positive reactions to the 2012 Dewey-Hagborg project Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gums - to create an image of the possible forms of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They were doing an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in the DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would have happened if Chelsea had been pardoned and could have attended the exhibition in person.
Indeed, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, a welcome change after several unbearable years in a military prison in Kansas.
Interestingly, the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people who seek to publish government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to incite resentment with his tweets in areas he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “everything happens for a reason.”
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is pierced by the heart) after the end of "self-acting factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - centipede letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope that people will learn from this, that our genome does not matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, this is 30 of them.”
The last example of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page from the graphic novel above.
It depicts Manning emerging from the King Kong of the United States Displinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they'll win," it says.
"Never let yourself be silenced."
"It's a direct transcript from one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, I get goose bumps."
Manning has not visited the exhibition in person - as predicted in the comic book - but when she does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genomic images, arranged like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to radiate the feeling of the crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes the form of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Wanted for Murder
A nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of murdering a man who was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lath, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged complicity in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County's court file.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
When they arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Police are looking for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of public relations at the university, said in an emailed statement that Lathem was now on administrative leave and was barred from entering the university’s school premises.
"The matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them," Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial administrator at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville College said in a statement: “We have been contacted by the British police and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the facts and wished him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to track down suspects are increasing," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities were assisting police in their search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were supposed to take place in apartment No. 1008.
Police described the scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren had been intercepted by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza’s management issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and investigate various motives, including domestic violence.”
"In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan" - Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to be implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) to be re-established.
“Currently, part of the criteria for the new plan has been completed and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of the WADA plan to comply with the Code - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, the code does not contain anything that should be of concern to Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.”
One of the criteria, however, calls for public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot admit to anything that never existed.”
Mutko’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with Russia’s RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “On many occasions, we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of carrying out doping checks within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
Following a visit to the organization’s Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “on the right track” to be restored.
Police have charged three people, one of whom is a teenager.
Police have charged three men with setting up Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in T<0xC5><0x99>inec-Guty in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stek.
One of the defendants is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
The Moravian-Silesian police director Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"This is a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter," said Kegel.
He said the police would discuss the possible detention of the accused.
Further information, according to the Director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say more so far, because the criminal police and the investigation service and the prosecutor who is supervising the case are really working on the case," he said.
The wooden church of the Body of God in Guty dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
According to preliminary estimates, the material damage will go up to tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Shortly after the fire, the restoration of the church began to be considered.
Most of the costs should be covered by the insurance, additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabov<0xC3><0xA1> also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by a fault in the electrical installation.
In its place, an exact copy was made.
The state counts on the citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations usable in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the factual intention of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state is calculated.
The Ministry of Defence, which received its processing as a task from the government, promises from him that in this way it will be possible to increase the physical fitness of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is the result of a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defense industry.
According to its authors, the basic goal of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the citizens of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the performance of military duties and on the basis of volunteerism.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow them to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would receive data on people who are willing to come to the country to help if needed in times of crisis, and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to help associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created, which would be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal emphasize that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after the declaration of the state of emergency.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the plan said, citing the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that, therefore, it is necessary to focus on supporting the widest possible set of capabilities, not only those of the military.
"The main goal of the plan is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond competently to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to not make it difficult for the armed forces of the Czech Republic to perform their tasks by improper behavior," the plan says.
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial claims.
According to the Ministry, the amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office envisages financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
Additional money would go to salaries or to build an information system.
The proposal also envisages the need to expand the scope of the regional military commands, which together would employ another 42 soldiers.
Ministry officials have previously said that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the EU directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find a suitable survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even deceptive.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust in the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
She asked for help from the outside.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with a specific intent to measure employee responsibilities, startups allow companies to vote quickly, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass supervisors and contact directors directly.
“There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of startup Glint based in Reedwood City.
Errett said she gained more awareness in three years of what her employees think and feel.
In addition to quick surveys and vote-specific teams, Glint offers a temperature map of the company and an up-to-date overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing the user to work on the remedy.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to pay attention to the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is being thrown into scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture research is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
The Denver-based startup Convertent in Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the start of the year, just ahead of Uber’s scandals.
Convercent’s nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken over its wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Management Board.
“The court of public opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior – and regulators fail to act – it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs more than 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate executives.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to track down a phone number or e-mail to the company's management, officially file a complaint and hope for a successful solution.
It was often a deterrent and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, the general representative of Ruby Tuesday, according to whom there had previously been no reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it is ensuring rapid detection and resolution of problems that have never before reached managers sitting in offices, miles away from the real solution of complaints - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s getting closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"At the same time, we protect shareholders from litigation by employees."
Companies stopped taking ethics, values, and employee involvement lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s collapse over employee ethical rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “social media lit up the whole thing,” that companies began to realize that in the online world, they couldn’t simply hide their skeletons in a closet.
“Before people started using technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent raised a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took away $47 million in capital.
Glint raised $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is being heard and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make a profit if a company succeeds and a company prospers if its employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool appears on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it is no wonder that there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless if the company does not take the necessary steps.
The fact is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case ever - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, director of consulting at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t finish the job, employees start asking themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now regularly conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to solve the problem within a day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision making and the quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday takes a very important look at its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the industry, which is known for frequent layoffs.
“If you don’t want to create a transparent working environment, employees won’t believe you,” Vitrano added.
“And when you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt."
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday with 38.3 degrees recorded in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n region is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic so far.
It overcame Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, there were not many temperature records compared to Tuesday.
Vedra mainly affected Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equalized at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice today’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice in the B<0xC5><0x99>eclav region, today’s 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice in the Brno region, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as in the case of Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Str<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE>nice, the greatest heat was in Dyj<0xC3><0xA1>kovice in Znojmo and Brod nad Dyj<0xC3><0xAD> in B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the CHMI website, today’s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures there began to rise only later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade away, and on Sunday there could be more significant rains.
However, in most places in Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia, as well as on Saturday.
We've had such a mess here.
Billionaires do not have the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to make direct decisions, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Penta owner Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>kovy Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also chairman of his party.
Ivo Valenta, the convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling, acquired the Party of the Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as the Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE> Mayor Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec unwittingly named the project by Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is a chapter in itself.
The mayors also recently caught their billionaire.
He is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, the owner of the security equipment company Jablotron.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
But the Entrée in the mayor's jersey didn't do much for Grandpa.
"I never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement to win 20% of the mayoral vote.
Leckie smiled.
Grandfather's utterance, however, is rather characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Dedek is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to run for the vote in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrej Babis.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s grandfather supported him in the previous parliamentary elections.
"Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a skilled speaker and does not rule the likable rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
However, he does not go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
Grandma is a hero to me.
He is willing to step out of his world, which he controls, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said that he wants the mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his views and stands by his no matter what kind of jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Babi<0xC5><0xA1> sends someone so clumsy to the Mayors to build his b<0xC3><0xA8>ta.
Others may wonder if Jablotron’s boss, for example, has broken up with Agrofert’s boss in a bad way in the store and is looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But Grandpa’s first public performances were not just about Babis.
Grandfather promised to send 10 million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to put a stop to such a statement.
After all, the court-recognized gauner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala was throwing millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, TOP 09 and the civic democrats came together in this way to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law forbids any political party to give more than three million.
When Grandpa entered politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
You might not have to ask yourself why politics has such a bad reputation.
He then crowned his first days in politics with a proposal for a tax advantage for families with studied children.
People with higher education come to our country about fifty thousand per month.
Those with basic at less than twenty.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the conditions here.
The one with the 20's.
In Grandfather’s vision of society, the poor pay their taxes fairly and the rich enjoy the benefits of a welfare state in which they are not very involved.
The rich simply need to be helped not to endure misery with want.
Mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> can shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
Then there is the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members of their party or citizens of the state do not have their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country to all people, not just some.
No one wanted Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex had to be discounted by 234 million.
Selling property is sometimes not easy.
And often it will not help even 11 bedrooms, a magnificent view of the sea, or the fact that the property is sold by US President Donald Trump.
When selling the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
This was reported by the website Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says of the land: "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of the real estate company with the US president did not defend the extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after a discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The stunning 5-acre residence on the Caribbean island of St. Martin features 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the land.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual prices of real estate on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of Saint Martin.
With the new price, it comes in second place.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
NCAA decided to stop two workouts a day. For Bruins come long days
Eleven o’clock in the morning is approaching, and UCLA’s American football players are squeezing at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal a sweaty back, an unmistakable sign of the first day of the training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of doing nothing adds up to a midday break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will take place next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"The next three days will be a lot of fun for these guys," Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday's swing on Tuesday.
By canceling two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, the training days are even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. – to fit into the already crowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in six seasons Mora spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year, and the training sessions are limited during the summer semester. The decision to limit the number of training sessions from two to one per day also has an impact on this.
A total of 18 training sessions are scheduled until August 20, after which the formal preparations for the first match against the Texas A&M team, which takes place in September, begin.
Mora was heard to support the NCAA's decision, even though it added another item to an already-charged player's diary.
“The players are under a lot of stress for three or four days and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
"But no one gave up, everyone's trying. They're great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of the surrounding plots from the adjacent parking lot and the luxurious Luskin Center Hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the goalpost.
Bruins players should occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that when the rooms are emptied during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is possible that someone can rent a room and record our training sessions.
Such materials are well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as parking number 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe that everything will turn out well.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans to Check Facts to Reduce Fake News
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties to check and display findings under its original posts in an effort to fight so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
French voters are flooded with avalanches of fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network ahead of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry posts.
Facebook said in a statement Thursday that it is preparing to launch testing of a new fake news check feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party authenticated messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” said Sara Su, Facebook’s product news manager.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
The little castle of Scotney Castle recently played a major role in the Squeeze music video, and Margaret Thatcher took refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy little town on the Bewl River in Kent, UK, which inspired curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of York County – known for his fondness for historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“The look at the writing of a man who is 300 years after his death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
"When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection."
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
But this is not Rhodes’ first book inspired by the archives: he is also the author of Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library-inspired documents – a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by the thumbprint on a letter written by a double agent in the '70s who worked for the Jacobites," he said.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to stay for almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, exploring archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of a hyena on a wall and bottles that had been thrown into a ditch for centuries.
He walked around the plot and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to hay people, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
At night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust gained access to the documents only in 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived at the site ten years later, the employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described as “the aristocrats of many centuries throwing their hands at the words: ‘Put it in the attic.’”
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing property: “You might think the land dispute is boring,” Rhodes said, “but I came across one case where two families were dragging on birch.
“Stop it, people!”
Some stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of a rebellion in a castle in 1380, which was called Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area, and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they’re somehow related.”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was only discovered a few years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes’s favorite family is Darrell’s: “I was intrigued by the male generation – the men at the time were always in debt and were spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
Different generations of the Darrell family dealt with it by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of the heiress."
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes searches for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week barn in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed in nature.
This is a special place for Scotty.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought, 'Now I'm going to go back to real life.'"
Washington changes the terms of the green card
President Donald Trump’s remarks on the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change the way the green card is issued.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 year-on-year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will do this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
"The new application process will favour English-speaking applicants who are plentiful in funding and demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country," Trump said.
Sex robots are on the rise – we should be on the lookout
Just when it looked like 2017 couldn’t be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Oh, yeah.
These days, sex robots are very popular.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former Sheffield University professor of robotics and artificial intelligence and FRR co-founder Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more,” Sharkey said.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable pan to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence is imitating human behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the nipples to the appearance and color of the nails.
But the very worrying fact is that many robots have their own “personality” that would embarrass Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set different character traits for his surrogate woman, including shyness.
And then there’s True Companion’s sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the “frigid Farrah,” which is characterized by a shy nature and the “wild Wendy” with an “adventurous” nature.
“The Roxxxy Gold Personality is set up to suit your personality to the fullest extent possible,” the True Companion website states.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons – not to be confused with real interpersonal relationships. Rather disturbing are the inferior female character traits and violent hints – for example, the frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website likens Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have Roxxxy?" the page reads.
However, sex robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their origin and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a shift away from ideal or sexual equality towards the desire for captivating sex with an optional bonus.
Most men, of course, do not buy a robotic woman, and while the FRR is talking about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the edge of public interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by modern times.
And most people are not queer or violent until they are excused by the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women around the world are getting their rights, and there is a president sitting in the White House who is often very defamatory about women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hung bodies and hollowed out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should resemble real women as much as possible (albeit with the rates of a porn actress).
Their creators construct them so that they are pleasant to the touch and look like a real woman at first glance.
But when it comes to their "personality", the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no job, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or undermine their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st Century: Servants.
The NBA star on the green oak.
Curry fights in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose despite a skewed first shot at the premier start among professional golfers.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player winner played the first round of the Web.com Tour at the Ellie Mae Classic low-level tournament in Hayward, California, in 74 runs and will be battling for a cut.
Player Golden State, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, but still he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four shots over a pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a little sadder," Curry said, adding that he was in a state of great agitation.
It was very nerve-wracking to kick off the first shot at the tournament, but that was all I hoped for.
“If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it immediately,” he said.
If Curry manages to fight the cut, which is likely to be set two punches under the pair, he will become the first representative of another sport that can do it on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've gotten rid of the pitch, I think I can do it," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in the past in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals.
In Hayward, he competes for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he received a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour series is one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
The unmistakable hallmark of the Trump era is the political divide that divides American voters and breaks entire families on a micro scale.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving season, the American newspapers swarmed with advice on how to deal with relatives who elect Trump.
Apparently, we're just waiting for our nerves to go away.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s family’s ability to consolidate.
I'm talking about it because this week I was visited in New York by my cousin - a poet and fan of the left who lives in Chicago and who has long paid for a Republican fool in our family.
She reminded me that being close in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the whole family — including all the Republican siblings with whom she has been arguing about politics for years — is on the same page.
Having dinner at the family table is a good thing; but it strikes me that, in a broader context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump strengthens the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
If we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the frightening possibility that his clowns may one day lose their attractiveness.
But there is an even worse long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior – the dog on the roof of the car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) – both of which look like very mild offenses compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be an enormous improvement.
We took my cousin's visit and took the kids to Central Park for the biggest carousel that the New York Parks department runs -- you won't find a better use for your three bucks unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the central cylinder is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filmed and staring at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look, and the cynical music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from the high-rise buildings, the panorama, instead of breathing on you the atmosphere and the reality of the city does not get your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t really Swiss cheese – not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub – but the London Underground station.
The carousel in Central Park, however, elicits a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, have a great time there.
If I could evaluate the carousel, it would deserve maximum points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I experienced a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
In the cafe on the corner of my street it is the same, except that I can throw 15% tip for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only does this slow down the otherwise fast sale, but the waitress is forced to rub herself into the shopper’s favor when it’s not needed.
The woman in the store apologised to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my credit card transfer with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a cut wound to his wrist, which, according to the prison, he himself caused after falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder on appeal against the original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the bathroom door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to South Africa’s highest court and the trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius faces a maximum sentence of 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive-bred panda has given birth to a cub that has mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the gene pool of pandas kept in captivity.
Zhang Zhong, a center worker, told the New China Agency that panda breeding is at high risk from kinship crossbreeding.
There were only 471 pandas in captivity at the end of last year.
Only 2,000 survive in the wild.
The attempt to pair captive pandas with wild pandas is thus the first step in helping to protect the species.
The 15-year-old Chao-Chao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandi mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists could observe every step of her.
She met her chosen one, Chao-Chao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males quite poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after giving birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted by bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police on 1 August.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules on free camping and are imposing severe fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> is in 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
Golfer Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Spilkov<0xC3><0xA1> is ranked 50th after the first round of the British Open Major.
A field in Kingsbarns Scotland bypassed the score of one punch under the steam when she played three Birdies and two Bogeys.
Thus, the 22-year-old Czech player hopes to go through the cut for the first time at the famous major.
Entering the competition with a grant of $3.25 million came best to American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round in the field record of 64 runs, i.e. eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are pulling millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch food safety watchdog NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, meaning that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk is only a limited number of egg types identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where the authorities also proceeded to close breeding, have not been imported to the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in whose markets the problematic insecticide brands have appeared.
Eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is usually included in preparations against fleas, lice and ticks.
However, it must not be administered to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization considers the drug to be slightly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd still like to catch ten years.
"Maybe I'll come back one day," smiled the 27-year-old Farmer, who could start the season in a Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n jersey.
Depends on whether he gets engaged before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as in school, I'd rate it at three.
The first year I didn’t catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I was learning.
The second year I started catching.
“Before the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But during the initial ten games we only got maybe five points, so the coaches started to shoot.
In the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Wonderful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slavs who have to change their playing style against them.
The skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the pitch.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem with traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s no problem.
He can sleep peacefully.
The program is usually done so that you play for example four matches outside and then have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball, it is a national sport.
Everybody's fans.
Even if it didn’t work out, a lot of people were coming.
Did Dinamo's participation in the KHL help Latvia to almost advance to the quarterfinals at this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from that time on, their World Cup scores started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell 1–2 in the quarterfinals with Canada.
This was an unbelievable result for them.
Thanks to KHL they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
In Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Roberts Bukarts took the lead and before signing the contract was Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many come here?
They're not bad guys, they're really good.
Local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It is a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn’t have a budget for a goalkeeper, we didn’t agree.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final they decided on someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That's what I was four years ago when I was leaving here and I didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am home after a while.
I caught something in the KHL, so I take it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How realistic is the option to start a new year in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it turns out.
Now all I can do is wait for the agent to talk.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn’t the time to choose.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government raid on Let continues.
In January of this year, in the article With the care of a good farmer? I wrote about the camp in Lety near Orl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the main passages of the article.
The camp in Lety has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it is probably best to look at the official website of the cultural monument Pietn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> Lety.
There, at the beginning of the historical overview, they learn that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from August 8, 1940 it served as a labor camp, from January 1, 1942 it was a collection camp and from August 2, 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, until March 1943, when the first flight prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, 370 people were transported by the largest transport to the extermination camp.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings caused by human beings and perverse ideologies.
There is no doubt that these events need to be constantly remembered.
There is no doubt that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970s a pig farm was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Lety.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the pig farm, but this has not happened yet.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was not until last autumn that the government approved the purchase of the pig farm and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the pigs.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably thwart those intentions if I went public with them."
We'll see what the expert opinion brings.
According to some unofficial estimates, it could be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
Either way, it won’t be cheap.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the whole transaction were beautifully funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which apparently does not threaten, I think it would be a waste of money.
Doesn’t the government have other priorities?
The monument, a dignified place of remembrance, stands by the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can pay homage to the memory of the suffering and murdered.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the place of remembrance with the utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should treat the entrusted property, i.e. also the taxpayers' money, with the care of a proper owner.
At least as much as your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister are not the whole government.
However, from the point of view of the foregoing facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I went to see the place.
Very decent driveway, modified parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exposition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheatre with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own place of worship, which is made of stones located in a moderate slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place, as they look and belong.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to conserve some of the uncovered foundations and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
Culture Minister Daniel Herman is expected to make a move in this direction.
If he manages to enforce the purchase of a piggy bank with state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million Americans and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Study leader Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales tilt to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that support tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacterium requires the presence of tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a link between one species of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support body tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had these immune cells.”
At the same time, he suggested that if the same thing turned out to be true for humans, then a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice bred separately lacked the cells.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The guts of mice were tested by DNA sorting, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
Mice that were bred in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome — so they didn’t develop this type of immune cell — were given L. reuteri bacteria — and formed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in the liquid and then transferred a small amount of the liquid - without the bacteria - to the undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After dividing the doses of tryptophan at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase cell population."
Jose Mourinho considers signing the contract with Nemanj Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his transfer to Manchester United “genius”
Manchester United won a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Matic - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut in Wednesday's match against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40m contract, made the first appearance in a 2-1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not participate in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> was out of shape and played only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, is necessary to work on before the start of the next season of the Premier League.
“It takes time, but it’s experienced, it’s intelligent and it has a brilliant mindset – it thinks football,” Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first game at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho begins to slowly form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source said this week that Mourinho still wants to sign with three other players, but insists the club did "fantastic work" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
“Thank you to the club for helping me win three out of four players,” he added.
"Four out of four would have pleased me more, but I admit that they did their best for me."
Life challenge of the king of chicken cuticles Ladi Pear.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to be drawn thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Academy.
The pear immediately blew up the chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to sign up for your cooking academy with this, because I think I can learn a lot from you, hand in hand," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of them had been on the cutting edge for several years, he hadn't forgotten to annoy him even this time.
"In return, I can teach you Znojmo diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is your favorite," said Pear.
He takes his participation in Pohlreich's new show seriously.
It's time to move up the level and learn from the master.
'The question is what the boss says, 'said Lightning.
Pohlreich, however, did not comment because he was filming new parts of his next show, Yes, Boss!.
Prima reacted to the participation of Pear in the culinary academy, taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
In December 2004, Pear planted a big blow to Pohlreich with his first cook.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 units!
The new program, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve works.
In the last episode of his show Now Cooking, in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed out pear on his shirt.
If he had my face, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'll just smile over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a said.
He thinks of L<0xC3><0xA1>d's culinary art.
"Cooking according to L<0xC3><0xA1>da Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka is out of the question even at home, because I will not let gastropunk go home," the boss says clearly.
I appreciate Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Pohlreich very much, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Hrushka said.
He's an idiot!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or an idiot," Pohlreich said of Pear in a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them anymore," Hrushek said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by winking
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and currently offers the same service through his BioTeq company to companies and individuals who want to make life easier with the technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, an anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure of implantation and adherence to medical procedures.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the entire procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam’s company also offers a service of replacing door locks and cars compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child has integrated the technology into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple wink.
White House Props Cost Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry last month came at $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME Weekly.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 White House program, which was a parade of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials watched a product show from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was displayed next to a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, and requested the helicopter's presence less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records said.
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the deputy commander of the Air Force the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and remain in place until the complete clearing of the entire site, which was scheduled between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The email also stated that if there is a delay in the departure of the flight from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the regulations on working hours.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter and a unit of security personnel.
From the records - obtained by TIME - it was not clear whether the second crew had been sent in the end.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was fine," the commander wrote.
'It sounds like you've been blocked, 'said the deputy commander.
This "Made in America" show was designated by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But even official events have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the president promoted health reform, which passed through the Senate, and spoke about trying to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aircraft such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after a presidential plane was flying in the background at his first rally as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is swamped with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which showcases products from all 50 states made by Americans from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House.
The crews of the HMX-1 helicopter often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn areas, and train any arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the crew’s current training, a state official said.
On the same day, a helicopter unit flew another 11 hours as part of a “non-presidential support mission.”
The White House said no additional requisites had been paid from taxpayers' money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not in any way involved in the negotiations to expose the helicopter to the South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep records of the budget for presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017 is $24,380 per flight hour for DoD expenses for VH-3D.
The unit's records show a time of 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
“It’s very misleading to state taxpayer costs based on estimates for reimbursement,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual cost.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, the reimbursements of DoD expenditure do not include personnel costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
The White House press secretary at the time, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
“The idea behind the show this week is to introduce products made in the U.S.,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and that they are providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands, of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in.
This fact is worth remembering.”
It is not clear whether Trump during his tour of South Lawn was also looking at the helicopter. It can only be said with certainty that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three of them."
A young woman was trapped in a swamp by M<0xC3><0xA1>ch's Lake, and the police came to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday at about two o’clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, however, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"For this reason, police officers soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Several police patrols went to the place she described, but it was not easy to find a young woman.
"Some of the police officers had to wade through the reed wetlands hundreds of meters before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Bal<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In the same way, she was also missing.
The police were guided by the direction of her call for help.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would count out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at three quarters to five in swamps in the area of Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That's why an ambulance brought her to a Czecho-Polish hospital.
Connecting Grandpa with Stan?
A wanted bride becomes a selling girl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project searchamelsusny.cz, as if the billionaire basically told voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
He also asserted that the politically disparate party of lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national agenda for the parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandfather, regardless of his political opinion.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta used to start like this, and it didn't work out very well.
With his pursuit of decent people and personalities, who will eventually replace some mayors on the candidates, which Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k admitted, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek also cancels the popular argument of the head of the STAN, that the greatest value of the movement are politically tested and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians even according to surveys.
They will now be replaced by quickly collected unknown personalities.
Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k explained the total breakup with the People’s Party, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, by the fact that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the People’s Party.
But if only a few people suspected STAN of identity then, after the arrival of Grandfather, the mere identity game ends.
Not only did Gazd<0xC3><0xAD>k long delineate himself against Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but at the first joint press conference, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, who publicly praises Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated as follows: "My goal is that the YES movement, that is, the Mayor's movement wins 20% in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't mess up the movement.
Grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show rather than a real political party for some time, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the bride in demand even more of a selling girl.
For a while, STAN went with TOP 09, then with the populars, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone answers.
Police Dogs Trained in the Bridge Overflight by Helicopter
Dogs specializing in explosives and search dogs practiced flying over the bridge by helicopter.
The police dog must not be afraid of flying, said Petr Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region police cynologists.
The training of a police dog lasts about two years.
At the Bridge, both adult trained dogs and those who are just undergoing training were trained.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were supposed to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the missing figure, all 12 animals had to get into the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order to immediately, as soon as the helicopter sat down, the dog could go to work, so that he would not have a problem with the helicopter's journey.
"The helicopter is coming, the dog is going and immediately looking," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog who is restless or is unable to start working immediately on a helicopter trip is excluded from training.
"Most of them are then left by dog handlers, for example, in the garden," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region with various specializations.
German shepherds predominate, but there are also Belgian shepherds.
The dog handler takes care of him from the puppy.
"He's raising it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which can reveal possible health handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and careless, he takes the first tests in 20 months.
"He's been hit hard for about two and a half to three years," Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health status of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
They usually live with their dogs.
Season 3 trailer for Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the centerpiece of Netflix's hit series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when the murderer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service - the first season has already received the first trailer and a list of other negative characters.
In Season 3, the DEA focuses on the world’s richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential godparents, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they escalate violent acts and bribe multiple government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if they are attended by all members of society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are participating in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if they are attended by women, as well as all related processes related to the elections.
Afghanistan's presidential and local elections are held on April 5.
The Taliban has published several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat activity to the second level.
In this year’s election, for the first time ever, one democratically elected government hands over its power peacefully to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery brews beer again.
For a good beer to the resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D> near Msen back to life a few years ago.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt into steam engine operation.
Years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state farm.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, new hope dawned in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same appearance as in the nineteenth century, when its golden era began.
Their work was awarded by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture, and the construction became part of the European Routes of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was solemnly restored.
If you want to taste the great Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, visit the brewery’s brewing area.
When brewing beer, they use Koko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n water springing in a protected landscape area, malt from Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> fields and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
In the tavern you will taste traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specialties.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, it takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past two.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its type on a global scale?
Such a unique building was supposed to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>aclé<0xC5><0x99>, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Bab<0xC3><0xAD>.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a vast underground.
There was to be a headquarters, a barracks, ammunition, material depots, a power plant, a machine room, and a hospital.
The construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken.
Thanks to the enthusiasts from the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also visit here.
The underground is now 75 percent accessible!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry cabin with exposition and underground, the complex also includes an armed light fortification facility, as well as two infantry cabins, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko educational trail.
Refreshments, cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building is on the list next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Traian's port near Rome or the Assyrian palaces in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today consists mainly of a massive four-winged convent building above a magnificent garden.
The list he got to, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet will help students with herbarium production as well as ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what kind of plant they have just come across on a walk, this application will advise them.
All they have to do is take a picture of the plant and the application will recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday to representatives of the CEEV Center for Ethical and Environmental Education in the Mountain Park in Bratislava as part of the project The Secret Life of the City.
The project was also attended by pupils from 50 Czech and Slovak schools, who together with their teachers photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French app is free to download on the website The Secret Life of the City.
The main goal of the French programmers was to have as many people as possible contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can already go into the forest," said Ivana Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the project's coordinator.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of a plant, the application can recognize its name in a few seconds, which it then assigns to the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech for the project The Secret Life of the City.
It is therefore welcome that users, after creating an account, contribute to the application with a picture of a plant that is not yet in the database.
"The French will evaluate whether it is beneficial and then add it to the database," Pol<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
GMB Concerns About McVitie's Investment in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from McVitie’s managers about a long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent about a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees, who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be "among the first informed" in case of changes in the plant's operation.
In a letter to the company’s construction manager, the Scottish trade unions expressed concern that McVitie’s “will not receive its promises to finance and modernize production lines.”
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the construction manager regarding the company’s needs and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and the employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the local factory represents a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and benefits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and falling slow production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous producer like McVitie’s.”
A Pladis spokeswoman said: “Tollcross’s builder received the letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
As in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and streamlining operations.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and its localities, and in case of any changes in the operation of the local factory, employees and trade union representatives will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t allow Neymar to be on his side after she paid <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the contract, but the French team warned Barcelona of its record-breaking raid three years ago?
Ligue 1 is ready to surpass more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogba to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the best-paid professional athlete in the world – after tax, he will receive over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is indignant at the way Neymar has bailed out of his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this three years ago by the PSG president?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs interested in taking over one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not afraid, because when someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely reach out to one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the departure of the Italian representative under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill for its brazen actions with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump nodded at anti-Russian sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump had written that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue to do so.
Even the idea of sanctions smells like straw from shoes.
These things can't be thrown into one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has indeed embarked on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China is not doing what the US president wants.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to sum it all up so that even ordinary voters, American, European or otherwise, would understand what the sanctions policy is based on and what system of rules it is based on, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only tightens what President Obama has already prepared, only giving it an implementation stamp.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump wins the US election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
It's a terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not easing, they are tightening.
Europe is even more afraid.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions violate international law.
Is this like kosher being just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian sanctions of the EU.
The head of the European Commission, Juncker, complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Are sanctions so weak that they don’t endanger anyone?
The ordinary voter is trembling.
For three years he had heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depended only on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now he is learning that it is about the energy security of the EU.
The electorate is even wider.
Russia is being sanctioned for being too rigged where it does not belong.
China is being blamed for being too small.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments, or only considerations, have their rationality.
But does anyone see it as a system, an order, or a rule?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I am not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> has married, crosses the republic with his visionary book and finalizes the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are already ready.
According to his words, he did not interfere with them in any significant way.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian region should be headed by the Governor and Shadow Minister of Education YES Ivo Vondr<0xC3><0xA1>k.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a deputy or a governor," Babis confirmed his earlier position.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect a president directly, and I am convinced that we should elect mayors and mayors as well.
In my book I do not talk about interfering with the representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
In presenting your book, What I Dream About, when I happen to sleep, I heard with my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of representative offices.
I don't remember.
I was talking about direct election and a reduction in the number of deputies.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor blames herself for not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same goes for a government that has only been run by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it well.
The current prime minister is not directing anything, he is merely moderating the debate.
It can't work that way.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
All we have on the agenda is a change to a one-round election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate of ministers and a regulation of the House's Rules of Procedure to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of MPs, who are supposed to work mainly in commissions and committees, from showing up at chamber meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
This is exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will run the government, control the 101-member House, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will rule the whole country.
I'm sure it's not.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of members.
French President Macron has announced a one-third reduction in the legislature, with 57,000 French per legislature, compared to 17,000 Czechs in our country.
But no one blames Macron for endangering democracy.
Even if someone in the Czech Republic wins the election by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the seductions for the one who has a parliamentary majority are big, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team in government to work for the people, not for their parties or departments.
For example, I do not understand why we could not agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services would be increased.
Why did they outvote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Is that what you would do as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is expected to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with a travel agency, and for the money of the state they would like to do business like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in the government should not argue, contradictions should be resolved outside of it.
There is no room for coalition rifts, power voting and deals, there is a decision to be made.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers behave mainly in partisanship?
Above the parties is the constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement did not apply, and he kicked Babi<0xC5><0xA1> out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a personality and has controlling powers, such a blunt gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you already know who you would propose to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in the government, no one wants to cooperate with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much scepticism is out of place.
The mayors have hired a businessman Dedek who would like to work with you, perhaps the wing of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unek, who is in favour of you, will win.
I don't think so.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, who does not rule out a coalition with the ANO, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus Jr., who also will not be against, may win in the ODS.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice President of ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with the SPD Tomio Okamura, for example in the area of economy.
So the Occams come into play as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta for the VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was a coup.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
A little brownish, though.
If I take his program, there is a wide involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views, speaks at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU is acceptable to you?
We do not consider cooperating with Mr Okamura's party, I cannot imagine.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can’t even imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the second.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let’s go back to your effort to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to act, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything go, never decided.
Coalition issues such as <0xC4><0x8C>EB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and that, in my opinion, was also the reason he fired me.
As soon as he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister brought a resolution written by the management of CEZ, which requires the Minister of Finance to vote at the CEZ General Meeting.
If you become prime minister, will you change the staffing conditions in the supervisory board and replace the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, we'll see.
I'm not one yet.
It is rumored that <0xC4><0x8C>EZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with the CSSD for even better cooperation with YES.
After the election, everything will continue.
I don't know anything about that.
I don’t have any lobbyists, I’m a separate unit and I don’t deal with this at all.
Then answer directly.
If you become the head of government, will you seek to replace the leadership of CEZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions you criticize?
I would like to see <0xC4><0x8C>EZ be a transparent society.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he is supposed to be in the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ majority, he never drove it, he was there only in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, push them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear unit.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocs is absurd.
And Czech television?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purposeful campaign against me, but I have no and will not have any authority to fire anyone.
But to dominate, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I’m just saying that the public pays about 7.2 billion a year for public radio and television, but they don’t really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the Chamber approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of general directors of the Czech Television and the Czech Radio.
Look how these reports are being discussed, on that super power pact Sobotka Kalousek that's always worked.
This applies to both the current parliamentary commission for leaks from investigative files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he was pressured by Kalouske to fire me from the government, which added a percentage of TOP 09, but the CSSD took them away.
They are afraid of the disruption of their corrupt system, and so they talk about the threat to democracy by Babis.
No one is immune.
What do you say to articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO, Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek, builds a power base by placing his son on the Supervisory Board of Tepl<0xC3><0xA1>ren Brno and arranging contracts with city and state companies such as the Prague Transport Company and the Czech Railways for his lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hl<0xC3><0xAD>n?
We have a constant dispute about that.
I don't like it, and I blamed him several times.
Faltynek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't step up like that.
As Minister of Finance, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, no Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>lov<0xC3><0xA1>, no B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If we had any hint of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we get rid of anyone, it doesn't matter who it is.
