Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they “look like muppets”
Some members of the Assembly are stunned by the proposal to change their title to “CHUP” (members of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal was provoked by plans to change the name of the Assembly of the “Parliament of Wales”.
Members of the whole political spectrum are worried that this could become a cause for ridicule.
One Labour official said his group was alarmed that the new name "rhymes with Dumb and Dumber."
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, this definitely has an offensive meaning.
According to one member of the Plaid party, the whole group is "not happy" and has offered alternatives.
A representative of the Welsh conservative party said that his group was “not biased” about the name change, but noted that the new name PPP (in English – MWP) has a certain verbal resemblance to “muppet”.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is pronounced similarly to the English Yorkshire pronunciation of the letter U.
The Commission of the Assembly, which is currently drafting the bill to change the name, made the following statement: “Of course, the final decision on all descriptive names by which the members of the Assembly are called will belong to the members themselves.”
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which established broad support for the Assembly to be called the ‘Parliament of Wales’.
As for the position of its Members, the Commission prefers “Members of the Welsh Parliament, in short ‘CPU’, but the PPP option has received the greatest support after a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly are proposing alternative options, but reaching consensus will clearly be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to submit the draft bill for the change in a few weeks.
The reform bill will also include other changes in the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of its members, as well as the design of the commission system itself.
Members of the Assembly will have the final vote on what they will be called when they come to a discussion of the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is planned to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has an administrative area called “Macedonia”.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to Greek state territory, and has repeatedly objected to its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who is an opponent of the referendum on changing the country's name, said he would not honor the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the country's name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin are silent against the backdrop of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“If you look from a historical perspective, according to the old people I spoke to, there was a bar and a church literally on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today, they're both gone."
Adams says the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing in different ways today,” he added.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhoods of everyday life where everyone gathers regularly.”
As for the churches, he expressed concern that the money from the sale of the assets would not last as long as the leaders expected, "and sooner or later they will be in the same position."
The man adds that churches can be replaced by blocks of apartments, where people live who do not help to survive the rest of the sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy homes in these buildings will be white, which will speed up the process of closing these churches, as it is not particularly likely that most of the new settlers are visiting them.”
Both churches were built by white flocks before Harlem became a black neighborhood – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist flock moved out in the years after 1930.
After that, the building became the property of the black residents of the neighborhood.
St. Martin was taken by black Christians under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott against retailers on 125th Street, which is Harlem’s main market street, because they did not want to hire black employees.
In 1939, the building suffered heavy fire damage, but the parishioners of Father Johnson drew up a plan for its restoration, ordering the bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly calls them “poor bells.”
The expert who used the bells in July has another description: “Cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The corresponding expert, Tiffany Nguy of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first bell system in the world that was used by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger system at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather mentions that St. Martin never replaced him.
What has taken place in St. Martin over the past few weeks has been a complex tale woven by architects and performers, some brought by secular church leaders and others by a diocese.
From the Vestiary, which is the governing body of the flock, consisting of secular leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing their concern that the diocese "would be willing to transfer the expenses of the Vestiary", although he did not have a role in hiring the architects and performers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old boy injured by shark in California lobster hunt
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy last Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the first day of the hunting season, authorities said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and rushed in with a group to get him out of the water.
Hamel first thought that the child had caught a lobster and was excited, then realized he was screaming “Bite me!
He bit me!"
Hamle says that when he got to the boy, he found out that the entire area of his collarbone had been torn.
“I shouted at everyone to get out of the water because there’s a shark!” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's hospital "Radi" in San Diego, where he was admitted in a critical condition.
It is not yet known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles said in a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the water a few weeks earlier, but it was considered not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
The authorities have closed access to the coastline from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Suomi in Encinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons while the investigation is ongoing.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which do not pose a danger to humans.
Sainsbury is planning an offensive on the UK beauty market
Sainsbury faces Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by opening beauty stands at its sites, where customers will be served by special assistants.
As part of the significant beauty market offensive in the UK, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow, while sales of fashion and household products are declining, the largest beauty stands to date will be located in 11 stores across the country, after which, if the initiative succeeds, similar ones will be found in more sites.
The investment curve in the beauty industry is being made at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to use the free space on the racks, until recently occupied by TVs, microwave ovens and other household appliances.
Sainsbury said it would double the number of beauty products offered to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current product ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space, similar to the offerings at Boots stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique make-up range so that most products can be used by vegans – something that is increasingly sought after by younger consumers.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will try discount programs in two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week, while the second will be opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the shifting focus on shopping for smaller amounts of food every day at convenient times leads to the fact that supermarkets need to make more effort to attract buyers.
Mike Cope, CEO of Sainsbury, said the sites would look more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to crack down on discounters Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury has had Argos sites in hundreds of stores, as well as opening Habitats sites since they bought both chains two years ago – which the company claims has boosted grocery sales and made the gains even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket chain to remodel its facilities for beauty and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury made a joint attempt with Boots at the beginning of the new century, but the association ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from the pharmaceutical company’s sites in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after Sainsbury sold its pharmaceutical business with 281 sites to Celesio, which owns Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by providing a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury, said: “We have transformed the look and character of our beauty stands to improve the overall experience for our customers.
We have also invested in special training of our colleagues, who will offer professional advice on the spot.
The range of brands we offer is designed to meet every taste and every need in a captivating environment with a convenient location, making us an attractive destination for beauty products that challenges the very concept of the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is “incensed” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle company to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the brand household appliances and accessories Truly.
The pair’s business is compared to Gwyneth Poltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of “This Morning” has announced her departure from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons Den star Peter Jones to “boil” after pulling out of their lucrative last-minute lifestyle business – and focusing on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “incensed” when the TV’s “golden girl” admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant there would be no more time for his brand of Truly household products and accessories.
The business is similar to Gwyneth Poltrow’s Goop brand, with rumors rumored to have doubled Willoughby’s fortune, which is projected to be <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram her departure from Truly, Jones left the UK by plane to head to one of her holiday homes.
One source shared the following: “Truly was definitely Holly’s highest priority.
It was expected to be her long-term commitment to secure her future over the next few decades.
Her decision to leave boiled absolutely everyone completely unprepared.
No one believed it could happen on Tuesday, so close to the start.
There's a warehouse at the Marlowe headquarters that's full of products waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of this morning’s host, one of the UK’s most successful stars, could cost the company millions due to a large investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household products, and could also lead to a delay in launching the brand.
And last but not least, it can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who has three children with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby herself founded Truly with Cap in 2016, with Jones, who is 52, joining as chairman in March.
The two families often go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand’s ambassador for M&S and will also replace Anne MacParlin as host of “I Am a Celebrity” on ITV.
A source close to Jones made the following statement last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult negotiations leading to “melting of relations”
He joked about the criticism he would have endured from news channels for commenting, which some would consider “inappropriate for the president” and too positive for the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump responded in a humorous “journalistic” way.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first took place in Singapore in June and was declared by Trump as "a big step towards the abolition of North Korea's nuclear weapons".
Negotiations for the removal of these weapons are stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told the UN General Assembly that North Korea “does not see a reciprocal attitude” on the part of the United States to the first steps of his country on the path of disarmament.
Instead, the diplomat noted that the United States continues with sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
In his speech, Trump presented a much more optimistic view of things.
“Our relationship with North Korea is wonderful,” he said.
“We are going to war with this country.
Millions of people would have died.
Instead, we now enjoy a wonderful relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results — ending missile tests, releasing hostages, and returning the bodies of U.S. servicemen home.
He also defended his unorthodox approach to negotiations with Kim.
“It’s extremely easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded zone, we would have about 200 people right there,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate the island and cause the death of hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs said they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok were forced to leave their homes, no national disaster was declared, which is a requirement for the initiation of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, there is an unequivocal view that no international assistance is required, which makes things a bit challenging,” Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to head to Palu, it is still unclear whether foreign personnel will be allowed to operate in the country.
The national spokesman for the disaster agency, Mr Sutopo, said Indonesian authorities were currently assessing the situation in Palu to decide whether international agencies should be allowed to contribute to the reconstruction effort.
Considering the ongoing earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains unprepared for this type of natural disaster.
Although shelters were built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not common on other shores.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu may have contributed to the loss of life, although a warning was issued.
Even under the best conditions, transport between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this logistics even more.
Until recently, a hospital ship stationed in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake was heading for Palu, but it will be at least three days before it can reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s backward infrastructure the centerpiece of his election campaign by investing large amounts of money in roads and railways.
But insufficient finances constantly harassed his cabinet, while Joko again went to the urns next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands forced to flee their homes, while Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other primitive weapons.
Daniel Sturge brought a late draw for Liverpool against Chelsea
Daniel Sturge saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute this Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturgeon received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27-28 meters from Chelsea's door, while his team was 1-0 behind.
He placed the ball on his left leg, then fired a precise shot to the far corner of the door.
The ball flew over the penalty area and headed to the upper right corner of the net.
She transferred the plunjered Kepa Arisabalaga and entangled herself unsavedly in the net.
“I tried to take a good position to get the ball under control because players like Shack are always looking for pitches in the front positions, so I just tried to get as much time as possible to get a good shot at the goal,” Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante asking, I pushed the ball, and I just shot without much thinking about it.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the 25th minute after a goal on his Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The striker of the “blues” passed with a fifth to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then sprinted from the middle of the field to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a quick double feed in the center.
Then he released a quick shot pass, with which he brought Hazard to a clean position in the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and scored with his left foot in the far corner along Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 this Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea's next opponent will be Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people are trapped amid the ruins of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that hit the country on Friday and led to waves as high as 20 feet, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, is dotted with ruins from collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspicion of Murder After Woman Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Mercyside.
The remains of the 44-year-old woman were found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds from the stabbing of Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the murder.
Police are asking for help from anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is still at an early stage, but I beg everyone who was near John Street in Burkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with the cameras on their dashboard, to contact us, as they may have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, was a resident of Burkenhead and that she was found in a private property.
This afternoon, a group of friends who consider the woman to be their acquaintance arrived at the scene and questioned where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, with police reporting that they are currently informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver who lives on Grayson Mews tried to get back to his apartment but was notified by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
The man was silent when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they were allowed to return home.
A police officer told a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans crossed the border while another van stayed outside.
Police are stationed at the border to monitor the apartment block.
All available information is requested to contact <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, code 247 on 30 September.
Cromwell’s Parliamentary Statue Becomes the Latest Memorial Hit by ‘Rewriting History’
Its ban would be poetic justice for his near-Taliban destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue next to Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be made a victim due to the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent performance of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thornicroft is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of respect.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps even more, in the 19th century than he is today, to be a defender of parliament against external pressure, and of course in his case it is the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is the conflict in the middle of the 17th century that shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a clearly recognizable face, representing one side of the ensuing division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be commemorated and celebrated.”
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, local media reported.
The man, identified only by his surname as Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a bulwark in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to inject his pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Sining, Qinghai Province, China.
He is believed to have arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and also found the door to the neighboring barn open.
He also reported that there was a large male pig with a bloody zurla in the stall.
Forensic evidence has confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked the farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and mutilated,” Wu said, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan going to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The killer animal did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so it could not attack anyone else while police were gathering evidence from the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market leaders are also reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Although rare, pigs have previously been reported to attack humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, and the man was critically injured after the attack.
Ten years before that, a 650-pound pig nailed a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife managed to drive him away.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
Pigs are like little children, extremely curious... not meant to hurt anyone.
But one must also treat them with respect,” the man concluded.
Weakening Hurricane Rosa will cause frequent and heavy rains in the southwestern part of the United States
According to the weather forecast, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves over the cool waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding rains in northern Mexico and the southwestern parts of the United States.
The rose includes 85-mile-per-hour winds, which is a Category 1 hurricane starting at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning eastern time and is located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push tropical moisture deep north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring about 10 inches of rain in some areas of Mexico.
Over the next few days, tropical moisture along with the approaching synclinal will create frequent heavy rains in the southwest.
At the local level, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause dangerous and rapid flooding, debris streams and likely landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in certain locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected, especially over most of Arizona.
There may be flash floods in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely unwise to travel a handful in the desert when the threat of tropical rains is imminent.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to raised dust and gusty winds.
The approaching synclinal will cause heavy rains in parts of the southern coast of California.
It is possible to reach precipitation of more than half an inch, which will lead to small waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
On late Sunday and early Monday, scattered clouds carrying tropical rain will begin approaching Arizona before the rain covers a larger area on late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October may bring major temperature fluctuations to the United States while the Arctic Ocean cools, but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
On Sunday, there is a wonderful example of dramatic temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
There is a nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to increase and expand.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have a warm start in October, with temperatures around 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast expected to predominate.
Temperatures in New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of temperatures above the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched Thursday on six television networks the captivating spectacle of the testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blacy Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that took place in the 1980s.
During this time, the political opposition continued, with the networks interrupting their regular turnaround programs in the last minutes of Friday: an agreement that was settled by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake and according to which the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was pushing her drunk and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his emotionally devoid testimony, is absolutely certain that such a thing has never happened.
It is likely that even more than Nielsen’s reported 20.4 million viewers watched the testimony on Friday.
The company has counted average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There was no immediate data available on the other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen traditionally has difficulty measuring the number of people looking from their workplaces.
For comparison, we are talking about an audience similar in size to that of a championship football match or the Hollywood awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, is the first of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen reported.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office came out with a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday how he was whistled by protesters as he tried to catch an elevator for a Judicial Commission meeting.
During all the harassment for several minutes, he never raised his eyes from the ground, which was broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm right here, standing in front of you," a woman said.
“Do you think he is presenting the truth to the state?
“You have power, while many women are completely helpless,” the attacks continued.
Flake replied that they had already left his office with a statement, and before the elevator doors were closed, he announced that he would take a further decision during the hearing by the committee.
Cable and broadcast networks provided tight live coverage a few hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to decide whether to transfer Kavanaugh’s nomination to the attention of the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he was sure the FBI would review the charges against the nominee next week, which Democrats in the opposition are demanding.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coones.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators, Fleck made a decision.
His choice was definitely essential, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “political flirtation” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political flirtations” with Britain’s future and of undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, published alongside her on the front page of the paper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called “Lady’s Game Plan” for Brexit, suggesting that the UK’s collection of customs duties on the EU and vice versa is “completely absurd.”
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dietian Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dietian Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials presented a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, with police reporting that Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and also found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to a report from CBS’s WAFB affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police announced that he had confessed to the fatal shot at Wade.
His guarantee is set at $350,000, Advocate said.
The East Baton Rouge Office of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday citing a gunshot wound to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department expresses its gratitude to the fugitives' unit of the Louisiana State Police, the police crime lab, the Southern University police and local residents for the assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
LSU’s athletics director, Joe Aleva, thanked local law enforcement for “timely justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall 6-inch player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Waynes also played basketball for the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 ricochets per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade announced that the team was "collapsed" and "shocked" after Wade's death.
Wade said, “It’s something that worries a person all the time.”
Volcano sprinkles ash over Mexico City
The ash ejected from the volcano reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater increased and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded in the past 24 hours.
The center has seen a lot of tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show a thin layer of dust covering the windshields of cars in some of Mexico City’s neighborhoods, such as Hokimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the gendarmerie when thousands joined opposition demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede from Catalonia.
A group of masked separatists, who were not allowed by the gendarmerie, began to rebuke peacekeepers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark and dusty clouds on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there were other clashes with the police, and the police resorted to their batons to control the situation.
For hours, pro-independence groups shouted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while those who advocated preserving the country’s integrity retaliated with “Spain forever.”
The local press reported that as a result of the protests, fourteen people received medical care for minor injuries.
Tensions remain high in the region, even a year after a referendum held on October 1 was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The vast majority voted for independence, although activity was low, as most opponents of secession boycotted the referendum.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the region's polling stations with a series of turbulent clashes.
Independence-seeking groups spent Friday night on the street to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
However, the demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who joined the separatist protest with his wife, says he no longer holds out hope for Catalonia's chances of gaining independence.
“Last year was one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they could vote, but now we seem to be at a standstill.”
Despite an important victory, with little difference, in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's pro-independence political parties are experiencing difficulties this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are either in self-imposed exile or are arrested pending trial because of their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Piug, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded on his phone the protest in support of the police, claims the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
He added: “It’s getting more and more stressful.”
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders arrested in anticipation of a preliminary trial last year, announced he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“My candidacy for the European elections is the best way to counteract the regression of democratic values and the repression we see on the part of the Spanish government.”
Londonderry arrests men after car crashes into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car crashed into a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings has reported damage to both the gate and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot with a crossbow.
Menga's goal brings Livingston's 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The rookie in the Premier League Livingstone surprised the Rangers and inflicted only a second loss to Steven Gerrard in his first 18 games as manager of the club at Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved decisive, and Gary Holt's team equalled in points with the second in the Hibernian standings.
Gerard's team remained without a win on foreign ground in the Premier League this season, and next Sunday faced the driver Harts, from whom he was behind by eight points in the standings.
But before that, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston is already in a series of six games without a loss in the championship, and manager Holt has not yet felt the taste of the loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a good opportunity against the hopeless guests
Holt's team had to lead the score long before scoring a goal, and his direct playing style made it extremely difficult for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson tried the defense, but his shot went sideways, then Alan Litgow shot past the beam after Craig Halkett turned the ball head-on.
The hosts let the Rangers play the ball, knowing that they could seriously hinder the guests from static positions.
This is how we got to the winning goal.
Rangers committed a violation, and Livingston played well, as Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined each other and took Menga, who took the ball and scored from the middle of the penalty field.
Until now, the Rangers dominated the ball more, but faced the impenetrable defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly rarely had to intervene.
This style of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a rescue.
Rangers goalkeeper saved Scott Pitman's foot kick, and a blow with Littleow's head passed by the door after another static position for Livingston.
Livingston's penalty area was centered, but it was easy to clear, and the judge twice failed to respect the guests' claims for the shot - first after a fight between Halkett and the Glen Middleton reserve, and then in case of doubts about hand-to-hand play.
“Phoenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for Livingston.
The team plays simply superbly, continuing to exceed expectations and improve their performance.
The style of play and line-up almost did not change after the team's return to the Premier League, but Holt deserves much praise for the way he transformed the team after his appointment.
He has real heroes on the field.
Captain Halkett was amazing, organizing the defense in a superb way, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Warrel under pressure.
At the same time, the Rangers showed nothing inspiring.
Under Gerard's leadership, they demonstrated some great things, but in this case they were far below those standards.
They missed the last pass before the goal, having only once managed to split the defense of the hosts – this loss should wake up the Rangers, who are currently in the middle of the standings.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) we witnessed smiles and blue spaces when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between NATO allies.
The friendly relationship has cooled due to problems affecting human rights, media freedom and Turkey’s admission to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest group of Turks living outside of Turkey.
For safety reasons, police prevented a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters flocked around to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan’s own policies and the German government’s decision to allow him into the country.
The various protests reflect the fault caused by a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and at the same time is despised as a despot by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist rests after a collision with a car
A motorcyclist died after a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in the southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. British time.
The driver of the car stopped and medical assistance arrived, but the cyclist died on the spot.
The crash comes months after another cyclist died after he was hit by a runaway driver on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police announced that its employees are working to identify the man, after which they will notify his relatives.
The road is closed and bus lines are diverted, and motorcyclists are also advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards were injured in a riot in a high-security men’s prison, according to the Prison Service.
The riot broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcester at about 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and is still ongoing.
In order to master it, special officers from the “Tordano” detachment were summoned, who will have to deal with eight prisoners, such as the riot itself in a confined to one wing of the prison.
The injured guards suffered minor injuries to their faces and received medical care on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained officers have been called in to deal with the incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six of the guards received medical attention.
We do not tolerate any violence in our prisons, and we make it extremely clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police, and their sentences may be extended.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in the Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that after an attack on a prisoner, the prison director had to be treated in a hospital.
Also in October last year, police officers from the anti-riot units were called to prison to master a heavy riot in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens with flash flooding Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (although arid areas may benefit)
It is rare for Arizona to be hit by a tropical storm, but there is a high probability that this will happen early next week, as weakening Hurricane Rosa sweeps through the desert to the southwest, bringing with it the risk of flash floods.
The National Meteorological Service has already set up anti-flooding posts on Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a different route over Finland on Tuesday, with late Mondays likely to bring rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix noted on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have sustained tropical storms within 200 miles of Phoenix!!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center provide 2 to 4 inches of rain with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in Mogolon Rome, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of rainfall possible in some places.
For those who are not threatened by flash floods, the rain caused by Rosa can actually be a blessing, as the region is severely affected by drought.
Although the floods are extremely serious concerns, some of the rain is likely to be useful as the southwestern part is currently in drought.
“According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Commission, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least excessive drought, which is the second-worst category.”
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to land reaching the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rose, which on Sunday morning still boasts a top wind speed of 85 miles per hour, is located 385 miles from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters over the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Therefore, it is expected to reach the land of Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rain over part of Mexico can be severe and lead to a significant risk of overdosing.
"Total rains of up to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora are expected, up to 10 inches are possible," the report said.
Rose would then head north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which would then pass through Arizona in southern Utah by Tuesday night.
“The main risk of Rosa or its consequences is extremely heavy rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the desert southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening flash floods and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsummer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old child was found with stab wounds in Summerset.
The wounded boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsummer Norton around 04:00 a.m. British time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition remained "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Summerset said.
Police are asking anyone who may have taken a picture of what happened to them to contact them.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered from the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Every vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the insidious and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "suffered by the vileness and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, categorically rejecting Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation of sexual assault decades ago at the time the two were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the prosecution hearing.
The president made a statement on Saturday that "today the American people have witnessed the intelligence, courage and qualities" of Kavanaugh.
“Every vote in support of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in support of one of the most brilliant legal minds of our century, a true lawyer with a great reputation for public service,” the president told a crowd of supporters from West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes for the general election.
“There are five weeks left until one of the most important elections of our time.
“Although I’m not a candidate, I’m actually a candidate,” Trump continued.
“That’s why I’m going around and fighting in support of good candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had set themselves a mission to “interfere and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate for Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, according to a senior Republican official.
Hundreds die after earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people lost their lives after many were swept away by gigantic waves as a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when at night the coast was swept by waves up to six meters (18 feet) high, carried many to their deaths and destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami struck after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat rose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not escape immediately, which is why many were victims of the disaster,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The water had brought cars, trees, whole houses, hit everything in its path,” Nugroho continued, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed the trees and managed to escape from the water,” he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed multiple buildings and shops destroyed, bridges demolished and twisted, and a water-stricken mosque.
Secondary tremors continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area inhabited by 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) issued a statement saying that the energy released by Friday’s massive earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The declaration also mentions that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "huge" and specified that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the spokesman added, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be higher along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
He also added that “communications are completely cut off and there is no information from Donggala.”
The Red Cross, in turn, pointed out that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its teams and volunteers had already made their way to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, but it can get even worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was fiercely criticized for not informing about the tsunami that hit Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time of the announcement.
Amateur videos shared on social media show a man on the top floor of a building shouting panic warnings to people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
After a few minutes, a huge water wall crashes into the shore and takes away both cars and buildings.
Reuters failed to verify the authenticity of the video in a timely manner.
The quake and tsunami led to a severe power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other essentials.
The city airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit the evacuation centers in Pali on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is now over 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
While World Vision employees from Donggala were able to safely reach Palu, where they found shelter in tarpaulin shelters stretched out in the courtyard of their office, they passed a number of scenes of devastation, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen countless houses destroyed."
The situation is extremely bad.
Despite the start of work on rescue and restoration operations of emergency groups, some complain that those with extensive experience in such situations are prevented from reaching Palu by foreign rescuers.
Under Indonesian regulations, funding, deployment of personnel and supplies from abroad can only begin if the affected area is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"The scourge is still at the regional level," said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government announces that this is a national disaster, we can accept international aid, but they have not yet declared such a status.”
As the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami falls over Palu, the friends and families of those still in the dark continue to hope for a miracle and that their loved ones somehow survived the natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been buried under the rubble for two days along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, has trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Championship, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Among those trapped at the Roa-Roa hotel were his students, he added.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, he carries his own emotional burden," he said.
Gendon recalled how in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa-Roa hotel reached the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors in Palu who took part in the beach festival.
Instead of a pair of blue bookmarks, however, the only response to his messages was a single gray one.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he added.
Robbers Raise $26,750 While Charging an ATM in Levy’s Newport
On Friday morning, robbers took $26,750 from a Brink employee who was charging an ATM in Levy’s Newport, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to charge it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the message.
While the man was busy, another man “came running behind the back of a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money.
Witnesses have spotted many suspects fleeing the scene, the statement continued, but police did not indicate the number involved in the theft.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should contact Newport Police on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Along with the announcement of the change on Twitter on Saturday, he also wrote: “The man officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaced singer Ariana Grande on the show, who gave up "for emotional reasons," the show's creator told us.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously claimed that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning 'you' or 'you'," West shared earlier this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“This way I am you, I am us, it is us.
He passed from Kanye, which means only one person, just Ye – which is a reflection of the good in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of our essence.”
The rapper is one of many known in his field who has changed his name.
Sean Combs has a number of nicknames and titles, including Puff Daddy, P Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced his preference for the pseudonyms Leo and Brother Leo.
One of West's previous collaborators, Jay-Z, also presented himself in a variant with or without a dash and/or capital letters in his nickname.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force as the country draws closer to the 50th anniversary of bloody crackdowns on students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, President L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired against a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people, while student movements with left-wing political views gradually spread across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly scholarships to students and opening more free public universities.
The president also concluded that unemployment and lack of access to education attracted young people to criminal gangs.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI development
At a time when China is becoming increasingly active on the frontline of developing artificial intelligence, the US needs to double its research budget in this area, says AI researcher and developer Kai-Fu Loi, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various U.S. government agencies made statements on the topic of AI, although the U.S. as a whole does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: the country aims to become the number one innovation in AI by 2030.
“Doubling the AI development budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far ahead of the U.S. and are about to make further breakthroughs in terms of AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could also double the chances of the next big AI achievement coming from the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview last week.
Lee, whose book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s largest AI companies – Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie University, Melon Lee worked on an AI system that beat America’s most successful Othello player, then served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee paid tribute to the federal government’s previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s robotics competition, and asked when the next one would be to help identify the new visionaries.
“Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government funding,” Lee said.
“China is not taking away academic leaders, it’s taking away corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights to work on AI.
Lee also argues that changes in immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen its AI program.
“I think AI doctors should automatically be given green cards,” he said.
The U.S. State Council announced its plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people from academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in AI development.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which wanted to set up a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not noted any activity for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of their country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum this Sunday whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, where there is an area called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents claims against its territorial integrity, which is why it vetoes its inclusion in NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum himself, while a campaign to boycott it casts doubt on whether the referendum will be able to reach the minimum 50 percent required to recognize its validity.
The question on the ballots is: “Do you support NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying in order to achieve the entry of the state of Macedonia, formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I came to give my vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonians, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old citizen of Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding force, enough members of parliament have decided that they will take into account the result of it to such an extent that the vote already has a decisive weight.
In order to change the name of the country, two-thirds of parliamentarians must vote for it.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, up from 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters visited the ballot boxes.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gyose Tanevski, a 62-year-old citizen from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union, in Strumica on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavadarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and arranged chairs in front of the tents stretched out by the boycotters of the referendum.
"We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them with proud heads, not through the servants' door," Kavadarkov said.
“Our country may be poor, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will lead to the necessary investments for Macedonia, as unemployment in the country is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the vast majority will be with us, as more than 80 percent of our citizens prefer the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his own vote.
The president also said that the positive result will lead to "affirmation of the future of our people".
Last Monday, the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies published the results of a survey, according to which between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum – which is below the required activity.
Another study, by Macedonian TV channel Telma, revealed that 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it won power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City goes through the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City's 2-0 win on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Playing Agüero for his goal in the 65th minute seemed too easy.
It all started when the Argentinian goalkeeper was found with a pass in the middle of the pitch.
He overtook three defenders from Brighton before sprinting with the ball into the empty space ahead.
Then Agüero found himself surrounded by four players in green.
He snuck past one of the defenders, then left the rest behind him on the border of Brighton's penalty field.
Then he passed to the left to Sterling.
The English striker with one touch returned the ball back to Aguero, who with a right-foot kicked over Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and found the right corner of his neck.
“Aguero is struggling with some injuries at his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted him to play for 55-60 minutes.
And look what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that very moment.”
But Sterling was the one who secured the initial advance of the "Heavenly Blossoms" in this match of the Premier League of England.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In the situation for the naked Agüero received a feed deep in half Brighton.
He immediately released a lead pass on the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sane advanced with the ball, then found Sterling with a pass on the distant beam.
The attacker of the "heavenly blues" managed to detect close up, shortly before the ball came out.
City will face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group stage match at 12:55 on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play determine the fate of Rockies
Since the Nationals did not qualify for the playoffs, there is little sense for another match of a titular starting pitcher.
Still, the always-ambitious Scherzer hopes to win the title on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, if the match is relevant to the Rockies, who lead with one match against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West standings.
The Rockies secured at least a Wild Card game after winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but it is not yet certain that they will win their first division title.
“Although we are not fighting for anything, we want to end the season with a good game in Denver, where the audience and the other team will do their best to win perhaps the most important game of the year for them.
“Why would I want to miss a game like this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday, but are expected to allow Scherzer to take part if the match is crucial.
For Scherzer, this would be the 34th game as a starting pitcher this year, as he held a training session on Thursday and would have the normal rest time until Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand pitcher has a balance of 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump recruits supporters in West Virginia
The president hinted at the situation with his Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, as he spoke about the importance of Republican votes in the general election.
“In November, everything we have achieved will be put at risk.
There are five weeks left until one of the most important choices of our lives.
“This is one of the biggest moments in current history – I also say that while I’m not a candidate, in reality I’m also involved, which is why I’m fighting with all my might for the right candidates,” Trump said.
“You all see this terrible, horrifying radical group of Democrats, you see them with your own eyes.
They are determined to regain power in any way, you yourself witness their ruthlessness, their malice.
They don’t care when they can hurt who they have to run over in order to cling to power and government, because they are only interested in power and government, but we will not give them to them.”
The Democrats, according to the president, set themselves the goal of “interfering and obstructing.”
“What we’ve all seen in the last four days,” he continued, calling Democrats “wrathful, nasty, vile, and unfaithful.”
The president recalled the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which caused strong whining from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you distribute the document?
Please, what?
No, no, I was waiting — that was a really bad sign--perhaps the worst I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer broad-minded.
The party is not tolerant of those who speak openly.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, few were surprised.
After all, I’m just the last Labour MP to be told he’s not welcome – just because I’m being honest.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment, as she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, censorship criticizes me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, topics that are ironically similar to those with which Jeremy disagreed in the time of previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour Assembly on Friday said that “we want the meetings to include everyone and be fruitful.”
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, Friday’s assemblies were just that.
Unfortunately, today the tone of most meetings and promises of a “lighter and more measured” policy have long been forgotten, if ever they were on the agenda at all.
It became increasingly clear that different views were not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion was judged on the basis of how much the party leadership liked it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while the colleagues I worked for before thought they shared similar political views began to expect me to make a reversal and take positions I would never agree with – be it on national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I make public statements – no matter what I say – there is a whole offensive tirade on social media calling for withdrawal, rejection of moderate politics, statements that I do not belong to Labour.
Like this doesn't just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I have even been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments about me are at least primarily political in nature.
I can only admire the professionalism and dedication of those colleagues who face sexist or racist upheavals every day without fear of them.
One of the biggest disappointments of this era in politics is how such insults became the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that the party is far from wide-ranging, with every sign of mistrust or change in the rules of the election becoming increasingly narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice to calm down, not to talk so much and that then "everything will be fine".
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student provoked by the Thatcher government, which through my neglect led to the literal collapse of my excellent school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – whether as a local councilor or as a minister.
I have never hid my political views, including during the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East could be confused in any way by my political position and my disagreement with the current leadership.
To all those who supported Friday's proposal, I would like to say that when the state rushes to Brexit, it will hurt households, businesses and the public sector, and I do not understand the desire to waste my time and energy in loyalty to the Labour leader.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: It is my pride to serve you and I promise that no threat of revocation or political excommunication will deny me the way I consider best in protecting your interests.

Air 38-17 Melrose: Invincible Air led in the standings
The two late essays may have changed the final score slightly, but there’s no doubt that Air deserved to triumph in this incredibly interesting match from Tennent’s Premier League.
The team has already led the standings and the only one of the ten teams is without loss so far.
Better defense and better use of opportunities proved decisive in the match, which coach Peter Murczy and his team can be very pleased with.
“I’m happy because the other teams have tested us quite seriously in the past games, and we’re still without a loss,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air, they really took advantage of their positions better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's essay in the 14th minute, followed by a successful additional hit by Frasier Climot, brought Air forward in the result, but a yellow card for Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to catch up in the result, after Jason Bagot realized an essay, followed by a yellow card for the Scottish national Rory Hughes, released to play in the match by the Warriors.
Klimmo increased the lead for Air from a penalty kick just before the half-time, marking an essay after a solo action, and then realizing the additional hit, making the result 17-5 for Air at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, followed by a successful extra punch from Baggot, reduced the lead to just five points.
There was a prolonged suspension of the game due to a severe injury to Ruarid Not, who was carried out on a stretcher, and after the resumption of the match Air increased their advance after an essay on Stafford McDowell and a successful additional blow to Climo.
Then the acting captain of Air Blair McPherson received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of his numerical advantage, exerting strong pressure and realized an essay through Bruce Colvin, followed by an unsuccessful additional blow.
However, the hosts regained the presence of the spirit and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card after knocking down Climo without a ball, from the subsequent punitive play McPherson realized an essay with the help of Air's advancing offensive line.
Climo made the extra kick, not long after he did it again, after Kyle Rowe caught the kicked ball by David Armstrong and brought the wing Gregor Henry on the flank for the fifth essay of the hosts.
The star of Still Game seems to be headed for a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kiernan appears to have headed for a more direct and warmer industry after it was discovered he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor played Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular show, which he also screenwriter and one of the two stars along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth season would be the last for the show, with Kiernan appearing to be already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official registers, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refrained from commenting, although a source at Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan intended to join Glasgow’s “blooming restaurant business.”
“The sea is ours”: the landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are constantly patrolling the rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Above the public buildings there is an ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea belongs to us by right.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the ocean, the memory of the lost exit, handed over to Chile after a bloody conflict in the 19th century, is still alive – as is the call to sail the Pacific again.
In fact, this hope is currently the strongest in decades, while Bolivia awaits a verdict from the international court on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"The strength is in Bolivia, there is cheerfulness and unity everywhere, and the country expects a positive result," Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla said.
Many Bolivians will watch the international court’s verdict on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will back Bolivia’s claim and that after decades of negotiations, Chile will be obliged to give Bolivia sovereign access to the ocean.
Evo Morales, the charismatic local president of Bolivia, who is set to embark on a contested re-election battle next year, also bet a lot on the court's judgment on Monday.
"We are very close to regaining access to the Pacific Ocean," Morales said last August.
But some analysts believe that the probability of a court ruling in favor of Bolivia is quite small, and even if it were in its favor, it would not change things in reality.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the authority to take Chile and has decided that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the international court’s verdict is only six months after hearing the latest arguments indicates that the case is “not complicated,” says Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of contributing to the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have actually hurt it.
“The problem of access to the ocean has been inflated by the current government of Bolivia,” Zarate said.
He then hinted that Morales’s belligerent rhetoric had wiped out Chile’s little remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult after what happened to be a normal dialogue.
The two countries have not maintained diplomatic missions with each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was taken unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an incredible opportunity to open the page of a new era in its relations with Chile,” as well as a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement by achieving benefits for both sides.”
Kalzadila also rejected the idea that Morales – who continues to be one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the problem of access to the ocean as a “political crutches”.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to go to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgement is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome our past problems.”
North Korea says it will not continue nuclear disarmament until it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never begin nuclear disarmament first if it is unable to trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech on Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during the meeting between the leaders of the opposing countries in Singapore.
His comment comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on the verge of restarting the standoff on the nuclear issue more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri called the idea “empty hope” that continuing with U.S. sanctions and objections to a declaration that would end the Korean War would bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first making a significant gesture on the path of disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal they see as the only way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to arrange a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion reviews in Paris reveal the last scream of massive hats, which will soon be in the fashion stores next to you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely block the sun's rays, there is no need to look for more.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown unveiled a range of incredibly large hats from their upcoming SS19 collection that stunned the fashion podium during the Paris Fashion Week.
Quite impractical hats caused a wave on Instagram in the summer, with designers sending eye-catching creations to stun the fashion community.
Valentino's prominence was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide periphery that literally swallowed the heads of the models.
Other too huge accessories included jeweled watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a selection of strange masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and reminded not so much of high fashion as of Hannibal Lecter.
One of the designs resembled a diving gear complete with snorkel and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cream funnel.
If you’re into these fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Fashion specialists predict that the huge hats will soon be sold in the fashion stores near you.
The huge hats came very soon after La Bomba – the straw hat with a two-foot periphery that was seen on everyone’s heads – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the extremely impractical hat that took over social networks led to the emergence of another huge design of the fashion podium – a straw beach bag almost as big as the one wearing it in a swimsuit.
A raffia bag in the color of a burnt orange, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the eye-catching item in Jacquemus’ La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitid told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer – once the designer has made such a big impression, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence, continuing in 2018 with another superior performance of exam scores, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports disciplines, art, music and other social sciences.
With up to 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Association of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their place in a global world.
As an educational sector that can compose and implement a personalized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they can understand, your words get to them.
But if you speak in his own language, you touch his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language when we want to build relationships and trust with the peoples of other countries.
Through the results of this year’s exams, we see that languages are first and foremost with the highest success for independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages achieved a high A score.
The data, collected by 74 members of SCIS schools, showed that 72% of students achieved an A score in Chinese, with the same score having 72% of German learners, 69% of French learners and 63% of those with Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland perceive foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will definitely need in the future.
Currently, languages as a subject of free choice by students receive the same attitude as natural-mathematical disciplines (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematical disciplines) both in the programs of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission showed that 17% of employers found insufficient language skills to make it difficult for them to find employees.
Therefore, more and more foreign language proficiency is becoming mandatory in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
More and more jobs require foreign language proficiency, which makes these skills essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if a person masters a foreign language, he will have a real advantage in the future, having mastered such a skill, which remains for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts the multilingual person one breast ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak a language, with French being the only language whose proficiency reached a two-digit rate of 15%.
That is why investing in language learning today is important for children now.
Proficiency in several languages, especially those of emerging economies, will provide children with a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, every school will be different from the languages taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered more important to the UK in the future by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child may have, there will always be enough languages to choose from in independent schools, with teachers being specialists in their field.
Independent schools in Scotland are determined to provide an educational environment that will prepare children and give them the necessary skills to succeed in life, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to play an incredibly important role for the future of any country, which requires this to be taken into account in the education system.
Indeed, modern languages should be realistically considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, along with diversity and excellent quality, to young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Association of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut this Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are thrilled to see LeBron James’ first match with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in the team’s first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not clear how many minutes he will play in the match.
"He'll be on the pitch between one and 48 minutes," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play relatively few minutes in the match.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers pre-season games.
“At this stage in my career, I don’t need pre-season matches to prepare for the new season,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned Trump rallies that include stops at familiar venues, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
By postponing a confirmation vote on his election to fill a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump aims to back the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress in the November vote.
At what time will the Trump rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch online?
Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m., Eastern Time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s visit to Wheeling, West Virginia, below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to consider hearings this week about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which have raised tensions over allegations of immoral sexual acts that have held the Senate’s confirmation vote for up to a week while an FBI investigation is ongoing.
However, the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November elections.
That’s why President Donald Trump’s campaign announced that these five rallies next week aim to “activate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to defend and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control over Congress is so essential to his program that the president will visit as many states as possible and we are starting a campaign season full of commitments,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The rally tonight, planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump’s second visit this month will take place in West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40% in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Republican Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has come to give him a boost in sociological research,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team will fight to the last while keeping their hopes alive before Sunday's singles
After three consecutive sessions without intrigue “foursom” matches on Sunday afternoon may have brought what Ryder Cup needed.
Changing the advantage in sport is a rather subjective concept, in which, however, players believe unreservedly, even more so in races like this.
So which team is in the best position right now?
“They were six points ahead, and now they’re only four, so I guess we’ve gained some momentum,” Jordan Spitt said at the end of today’s race day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, with only twelve more to allocate.
However, as Spite says, the Americans still have a lot to show and their fans should not lose hope, if we have to judge by the sportsmanship of Spite and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them scored three out of four possible points.
Spite shows excellent shape from the beginning to the end of each hole and is the real leader of his team.
The encouragement of the fans became stronger as he progressed into the round, in which with a precise punch he leveled the result in the fourth game, after he and Thomas were left behind by two shots after the first two holes.
His blow, which won them the match on the 15th hole, was met with strong reactions that make us believe that not everything is really lost for the American team.
“The important thing is not to think about anything else and to focus on your own game,” Spite says.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to remember.
The only players with more points than Speith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed heroes of the Ryder Cup so far.
The strange but admirable couple from Europe, won four out of four and it seems they are all succeeding.
Mollywood were the only couple who didn’t make “gods” on Sunday afternoons, but they also didn’t have “gods” either on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, or mornings.
These successes, as well as the way the energy seemed to flow between them and the enthusiastic fans, confirmed the opinion that they are the players who will win on Sunday and there will be no better pair than Flitwood and Molinari, which will bring the potential victory of Europe as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, the tales of European fame turned out to be a little premature.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning’s “fourball” matches, while he partnered with Alex Noren.
“Gods” and two “doubles” of the first nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swede into problems that they could not cope with.
On Sundays, however, there is no one else who can solve your problems.
“Fourball” and “foursom” matches are extremely interesting to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the tips they exchange with each other, and the way a strategy can undergo changes at any moment.
The Europeans played better on the team and therefore gained a significant lead before the last day, but this session of “foursom” matches showed that the American team is also ready to fight to the last – something that many people, especially in the United States, strongly doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a solid lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup, after leading the United States 10-6 after playing the matches in the formats of “fourball” and “foursom” on Saturday.
Inspiring duo Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari began with two victories against the inconclusive Tiger Woods, with their asset at the Le Golf National rising to four points.
In an attempt to regain the trophy, which he lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team dominated the morning's "fourball" matches over Americans who made a mistake after a mistake, and eventually Europe won the series with 3–1 victories.
The U.S. resisted more in the Foursom games, where they won two victories, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furrick's team needs 8 points from 12 singles games on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first rookie from Europe to score four points in a row, and he and Molinari, known as Mollywood, became only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after this sensational weekend.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the “fourball” matches, they were extremely motivated to beat the broken Woods and the American rookie Bryson Decambou with an even more definite result 5&4.
Woods, who barely made it through his two games on Saturday, only occasionally demonstrated outbursts of genius, but so far he has 19 losses from 29 matches in “fourball” and “foursom” matches, as well as a total of seven consecutive losses.
Justin Rose, who got a break for the morning "fourball" matches, partnered with Henrik Stanson in the "foursom" clashes in the 2&1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Cope - respectively, the number one and number three in the world.
However, the team of Europe failed to enjoy a completely pleasant, cool and cloudless day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas returned the hopes of the Americans, winning two points on Saturday.
They achieved a difficult 2<0xC2><0xA7>1 win against Spain's John Ram and Jan Polter in the "fourball" matches, and later returned to defeat Polter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the "foursom" meetings, although they lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the "Rider Cup" there was a team catching up four points deficit before the singles, and according to the regulation, the team Furik will keep the trophy even in a draw.
However, after being outplayed on two consecutive days, it seems that their chances of a turnaround on Sunday are not particularly high.
North Korea Says 'No Way' to Disarm Unilaterally, Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepened distrust of the United States and there was no way the country could unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong-hou said that "significant goodwill measures" had been taken over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site, and vowing not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not believe in our own national security, and under no circumstances will we be able to disarm unilaterally first.”
While Ri voiced North Korea’s familiar grievances about Washington’s resistance to a “step-by-step” approach to eliminating nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking step-by-step measures, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump gave guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for easing tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists 'first to remove nuclear weapons' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and even objects to the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can make us fall to our knees is a meaningless dream for those who don’t know us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention whether a second meeting between Kim and Trump was planned, which the U.S. leader stressed through the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed on the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the country on the issue of nuclear disarmament were South Korea and not the United States, the removal of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a stagnation.
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from the previous year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the continental United States was inevitable after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
That year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea removes its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no deadline and said, “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "implementation of Security Council sanctions must necessarily continue until complete, definitive and confirmed nuclear disarmament takes place."
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in a bid to halt funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
This year, Pompeo visited North Korea three times, but his last trip went well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but only hours later North Korea accused him of making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to destroy a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and that he wanted to achieve a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard on a course for enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year makes all students sleep more in an attempt to combat the growing culture of “all-night learning” using caffeine.
A lecturer found that students at the world’s number one university often don’t even think about the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Kaysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, has prepared a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally a girl came to me and said, ‘Why do they tell me this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is being held for the first time this year, explains to students the most important things about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievement, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Bareira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after it was found that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light, how sports performance is affected by lack of sleep, and the importance of bedtime sleep routine.
Another part of the participants told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke.”
The culture of pride in “learning all night” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate and quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he says – even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a hunger mode, making them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Kaysler prepare the course by taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He says his course “opened his eyes” and inspired him to spread it throughout the campus.
It hopes that the next step is for all graduates to be asked to complete a similar curriculum before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Kaysler recommends that students consider setting up a bedtime and wake-up alarm and being aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal toppled Gerard's team
The Rangers suffered another loss after Dolly Menga's shot broke the hopeless team of Steven Gerrard and brought a 1–0 victory for Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first win as a guest of the triumph in February with 4–1 over St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted Gerard's second defeat in his 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points less than Harts's breakaway team, the leader of the Lad Visha.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the lack of constructive ideas Rangers team at no time seemed close to equalizing.
After the match, the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston are now third, lagging behind the second Hibernian only in goal difference.
For the Rangers, there may also be additional problems, as side judge Callum Spence received a head wound after being hit with an object that was apparently thrown by the fans of the guests.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that defeated Air in the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same Eleventh of Livingston, who drew a point against Harts last week, and should be pleased with the way his aggressive team countered all the actions of the enemy.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did better in the rarer cases when they owned it.
They should have noted in the second minute, when Menga brought a touch of Scott Pittman against goalkeeper Alan McGregor, but the midfielder missed the good opportunity.
Later, centering Keegan Jacobs from the foul found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow diverted the ball away from the rear beam.
The Rangers took control of the game, but failed to create anything meaningful in the last third of the field.
Alfredo Morelos definitely thought he should have a shot in the 15th minute when he clashed with Stephen Lawles, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the claims of the Colombian.
The Rangers scored only two accurate shots in the first half, but the former goalkeeper from Ibrox Liam Kelly easily dealt with the blow with the head of Lasana Coulibaly and with the weak shot of these Ejarias.
Although Livy’s goal in the 34th minute was surprising given the possession of the ball, it was fully deserved.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' deep centering.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher turned the ball to Scott Robinson, who coolly handed it to Menga, for whom it was easy to realize.
Gerard reacted to the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and this shift almost immediately resulted in a result when the wing handed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out resolutely and blocked the blow.
Livingston, however, continued to force guests to play in a home-friendly style of play, with Litgow and Halkett constantly repulsing the long balls sent forward.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the last minutes, but McGregor managed to cope with the blow of Jacobs, and with the following corner Litgow shot with his head along the beam.
Reservist Glen Middleton of the Rangers asked for a shot at the end of the match after a fight with Jacobs, but Thomson again saw nothing wrong with the situation.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Page from our annual Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and NUMBER... the day the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
A cornerstone of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture when the 1950 film The Bells of Coronado, starring the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, was released.
Man: “What in God’s name is this?
Rogers: This is a geiger counter and is used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Definitely cares right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells
A new cancer vaccine could train the immune system to “see” foreign cells and kill them
The vaccine trains the immune system to recognize foreign cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and changing them in a laboratory
They can then “see” a protein that is common to many types of cancer and are injected again into the patient.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which trains her immune system to recognize foreign cells, saw her ovarian cancer go away in more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting them again into the patient.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kenny West gave a speech in support of Trump wearing a hat that read, “Let’s make America great again,” while attending SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kenny West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after making a meaningless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing his third song for an evening called Ghost Town, during which he wore a hat that read, “Let’s make America great again,” he went against the Democrats and declared his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL started the show featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Commission for sexual assault complaints made by Christine Blaise Ford.
Although it wasn’t broadcast, West’s recording of the performance was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear why Rock tried to mock West with his publication.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems behind the scenes because of his hat.
“I was caught behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
I'm being harassed!
And then they claim I'm on a sinking ship," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see the sinking ship?", claiming that he would wear the Superman suit, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try it with love.”
The comments sparked at least two public outcry and the SNL team members looked embarrassed, Variety reported, with one of them saying, “The whole studio is silent.”
West was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West puzzled many with the performance of the song "I Love it", dressed as a bottle of "Perie".
West received the support of the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR GOING AGAINST THE GROUND."
Speaking on Twitter, host Karen Hunter said West was "just being himself, and that's great."
“But I choose NOT to reward a person (by buying music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I think welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's free.
That’s how we are,” she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to "now officially known as Kenny West."
He was not the first artist to change his name, and followed the example of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and P. Didi.
His friend, the rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lyon, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol.
Attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the prosecution.
Igrane A Thrones star Keith Harrington is against toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the swinging sword of John Snow in the violent medieval fantasy series of the NGO Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor opposed the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that showing such roles on the screen leads young people to often think they have to be “rigid” to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admits he feels “firmly convinced” that the problem needs to be solved.
“At the moment, I personally am firmly convinced – what have we been wrong about masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach adolescents about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the many masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught by television and on the street that makes boys feel that they need to become this particular type of man?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time – how can we change it?
Because obviously something is wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in a prequel or sequel to "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer, claiming that he was "finished with the battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepherd's "The Real West," a story about a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how he gave me my future family and defined my life for the future,” he said.
Rose plays Igrit, the girl in whom Keith's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family’s mansion in Scotland.
HIV/Spin: China Reports 14% Increase in New Cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV and spin.
According to health services, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of new cases are caused by sexual contact, which marks a change compared to the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, the health services of China said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, each year the number of people living with HIV and spin in China increases by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against people in KGB communities is widespread.
According to studies, because of conservative values, 70-90% of men who have had sexual intercourse with men end up marrying women.
Many cases of transmission of diseases are the result of improper protection in these relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies having leaked data from Republican senators, denounces "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information to three Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were made by experts and websites on the “ultra-right wing.”
"Lies, lies and more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information includes the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, who are from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from the Capitol during a Senate hearing on allegations of immoral sexual behavior against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to Waters’ office, and leaked information about a member of her team, according to Hill.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team – whose identity, personal information and safety have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – is in no way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded claim is completely false and is an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“There is poison in this denial,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
You don't have to be challenging.
I don't have to question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of also looking angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Essentially, if it's true," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had referred the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies for these fraudulent claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my team.”
Review of “Johnny English Explodes Again” – the weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for references to Brexit in every new British-participated film, and it seems that this also applies to the revival of the action-comedy, spy franchise for Johnny English – which started in 2003 with “Johnny English” and returned in 2011 with “Johnny English is Back.”
Will self-deception and facial expressions that tell how obvious it is that we are stupid become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with his eyes up and his "rubbery" face is allowed to repeat things for the second time - his name is of the greatest importance when it comes to a large comic creation designed for movie fans who do not speak English.
He is, of course, a stupid undercover agent who, despite his strange claims of flattering brilliance, possesses little of Clouseau, little of Mr. Bean, and much of the man who contributed a note on the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London Olympics in 2012.
In addition, it was originally based on the chaotic traveler and international man Atkinson played in Barclaycard's already forgotten television commercials.
There are two good moments in the last Johnny English movie.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter carrying in a medieval armor and for a short time the fins soaked in his helmet.
Atkinson's contribution to physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather weak and oddly redundant, especially when "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Mission Impossible" include a dose of comedy.
Humor seems to be geared toward children rather than adults, and Johnny English’s crazy accidents aren’t innovative and focused, as Actinson’s lack of play reminds me of Mr. Bean.
The current premise is that the UK is facing serious problems.
A cyberhacker has hacked into Britain’s super-secret spy network and revealed the identity of all operatives for the horrification of the on-duty agent—unfortunately, a small role for Kevin Elden.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a bloated and pompous figure and already suffers from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best for this quasi-Theresa May role, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that she needs to call a retired agent, as all acting agents are compromised.
And that means Johnny English himself, who currently works as a teacher in a chic center, but who illegally teaches lessons on how to be an undercover agent: there are some good hits here when English recreates a spy rock academy.
English is summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former longtime assistant Bo, played again by Ben Miller.
Bo is already a family man, married to a submarine commander, a fun role in which little is wasted Vicky Pepperdine's talent.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game to solve the big problems of Her Majesty's Secret Service and face the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Bo begin their odyssey of farce: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; create chaos when they sneak on Volta's luxury yacht; and English causes real anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to get to know the interior of Volta's house.
All the jokes are certainly taken from the previous film, but since it is so cute and lush, there is much more content here, designed for children.
Quite a mediocre production.
As with other Johnny English films, I keep thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Atkinson a role that suits his talent?
Labour denies they are working on a plan to work four days a week, but get paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan for the British to work four weeks but get paid for five.
The party says it wants company bosses to provide workers with the savings made through revolutionary artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them another day off.
She wants workers to enjoy a three-day weekend, but get the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "pass" the economic program and the party's plans to shake the country in favor of the workers.
The move to a four-day work week has been approved by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy review will be announced before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen right away, but the four-day work week is an aspiration that fits into the approach of rebalancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Green Party promised a four-day working week during its general election campaign in 2017.
At the moment, however, this aspiration does not meet the approval of the entire Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not in the party’s politics, it is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from “unpersonal directors” and “speculators” in utilities firms.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that the current owners of shares in water companies may not get their full share, as the Labour government could impose “deductions” on the basis of the violations found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on the boards of companies and create privatization funds to transfer 10 percent of the net capital of private companies to employees, which can accumulate annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy spoke before “60 Minutes” whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the bureau’s findings could force some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more outspoken than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, after this statement came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, firm and unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seemed uncompromising.
"I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and to change it, a shaking charge is needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied it categorically,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasio Ford.
“And no one she mentioned, but she could confirm it.
That's 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and does it help to reduce poverty at all?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive line-up of performers and carries out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty around the world.
Now, in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will gather tens of thousands of people on the great lawn in Central Park, who will not only enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but will also get acquainted with the true purpose of the event - the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international protection group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending a non-email to a world leader, making a phone call or otherwise connecting to help raise awareness about their goal of eradicating poverty.
But how successful is “Global Citizen” 12 years before it achieves its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a brilliant way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” – people think they are doing something meaningful when they sign an online petition or send a post on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, who insist on many different goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and messages resulting from its actions, from which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided have already directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main commitments include “The Power of Nutrition,” a UK-established partnership between investors and contractors, a commitment to “helping children develop their full potential,” which promises to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after more than 4,700 Twitter posts were received by “global citizens.”
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a mere historical memo,” Tracy Ullman, an ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told an audience at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions have been taken to call for Britain to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the FAQs on his website asking, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
“Global Citizen” replied: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will fail and again we will fail.”
But just as with the great civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movement before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are just some of the performers at this year's New York event, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces to “block” and obstruct energy exports
Washington could, if necessary, resort to its naval forces to prevent Russian energy products from entering markets, including the Middle East, Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said.
Zink argues that Russia’s involvement in Syria – in particular, where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to sell energy, just like they did in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can, through our naval forces, ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that energy products do not reach the market,” he said.
Zinc turned to attendees of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He aimed to compare Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are the same.
“The economic option with respect to Iraq and Russia is, more or less, stimulating and replacing fuels,” he said, while describing Russia as a “one-numbered pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes at a time when the Trump administration is tasked with boosting liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Trump says is turning Berlin into a “hostage.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion pipeline to Nord Stream 2, which will double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project is dictated simply by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (DBDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
“Elizabeth Warren will take a serious look at the 2020 presidential nomination,” the Massachusetts senator said.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday he would “look seriously” at the presidential bid after the midterm elections.
During a city council meeting in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running for office.
“It’s time for women to come into Washington and fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will take a serious look at the presidential nomination."
Warren expressed his judgment on President Donald Trump at a city council meeting, saying he was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
“I worry to the bottom of my soul as Donald Trump does with our democracy,” she said.
Warren was outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a sociological survey conducted on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think that she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a study by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported this nomination.
The poll showed more support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for and 48 percent against.
Other senior Democratic Party officials discussed on a potential bid in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a formal decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin pointed out PTSD to Trak Palin at a rally for Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
He was arrested and charged with an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through after I return is familiar to other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are coming home with,” she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, hardened, they come back and wonder if they will get that respect that they and their brothers in arms gave the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, included in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila's police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gangster and domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and counties filed a goodwill petition in Washington on Friday in support of asylum seekers and challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, has not been revealed.
She said her partner and the sons of his gang members had harassed her, but U.S. officials rejected the asylum application on July 20.
She's being held in Texas.
U.S. lawyers who help Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which are home to a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing sweeping gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy has brought back the 2014 decision of the Immigrant Appeals Board, which allowed immigrants who fled domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County attorney Carl Rasin said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be considered according to the specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the report said.
In addition, lawyers argue in the report that policies that deny entry to immigrants harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is given to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in his July 11 policy communiqué.
Shelter has never been intended to alleviate all the problems – not even all the serious ones – that people face every day, anywhere in the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as deaths double as search for survivors
The situation for the survivors is getting worse.
"I feel very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, reassuring her sick boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance carries more bodies.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents have been spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save something from their flooded belongings.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the victims, including Dwight Harris, who suffered a fracture of the spine and shoulder, were placed outside the Army Hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to ongoing secondary tremors.
His eyes are filled with tears when he recalls how he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was pressed into the broken wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he had come to the city with his family to attend a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then she shut up.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Brotherhood’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official newspaper in China ran a four-page advertisement in an American daily for the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump cited a paid China Daily publication in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections.
Trump’s accusation that Pecki is trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign of pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war in which they level import tariffs between countries.
According to experts from the United States and China, at the beginning of the trade war, tariffs in China were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which support the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a commentary in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “is currently doubling this harassment by putting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America’s respected tradition of freedom of speech and the press by running a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited speeches and you will not see a true reflection of the divergent views that the Chinese people may have regarding China’s disturbing economic trajectory, given that the media is under the strict control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers avoids the offer to publish” his article, although it does not specify exactly who.
Kavanaugh Pogrom: Republicans Repel Women Voters in Midterm Elections, Analysts Warn
As many of the top Republicans stand by and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on several sexual assault charges, analysts have warned there will be a retaliatory response, more specifically from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the tray are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already noted that they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be reversed,” said Grant Raher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Raher said he doubted whether the last-minute insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) on an FBI investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday — they will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, in a statement.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” during a demonstration in the Senate corridor as Republicans who control the judicial committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s nomination despite Dr. Christine Blasio Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be excluded,” said Stu Rotenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
“People say the problem is already serious; that’s true.
But it can get even more serious, especially among suburban women voters and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who often don’t vote because they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggest that a retaliatory response could follow if Republicans insist on confirmation of the candidacy.
“This has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote, the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it’s about how Republicans deal with it and how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Americans, however, seem somewhat divided on the question of who to trust in the aftermath of Ford and Cavanaugh’s testimony, with a little more leaning towards the latter.
A new sociological survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent say they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they believe Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while 30 percent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s allegations, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez says the Supreme Court candidate showed his genitals to her while they were at a party while she was attending Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to attack Google and Facebook
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a venture that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is building the Berners-Lee Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have permission to access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said with regard to the undertaking.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "online personal data repository" or POD.
It contains lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It looks like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, which are available through any browser, and at the same time it is all at the same time.
The unique thing about the online personal data repository is that the user determines who has access to what information.
The company calls it “granting authority for personal data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to invest resources, processes and appropriate skills to help Solid become accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on the project, and a group of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change or not when all of their business models are completely updated overnight.

Bernard Van: In Memory of the Priest Honored with the Victoria Cross in the First World War
It marks 100 years in the hometown of the only Anglican priest to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his involvement in World War I fighting.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Van won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper, without realizing that he had been awarded the highest military honours of the United Kingdom.
A memorial was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the monument would be discovered exactly 100 years after the work of his grandfather, who was awarded a medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in very dense fog and under heavy artillery and machine guns fire."
He later attacked the firing line and with "incredible courage" led the formation forward before attacking an artillery cannon with one hand and killing three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never do, but it makes me humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van placed a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said it was a "great honor for him to participate in the parade" and added "the virtue of the true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given to many people."
MMA fans waited all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead got Peppa Pig
Imagine waiting all night to watch a full edition of Bellator 206 and finally you can’t witness the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 matches, including six from the main map, and had to be broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Geghard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after waking up to the early hours, especially because of the fight.
Fan described on Twitter the switching of the children's animated film as "some kind of sick joke".
“The government is regulating that at 6 a.m. this content is not appropriate, so the program was changed to a children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, in response to a question about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig," yes."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said he would work on planning meetings to include UK viewers in the future.
"In my opinion, when it comes to repetitions, we can solve the problem," Cocker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday, and there is no way to plan things so that the event is held here on Sunday and there on Monday.
We're still working on it.
Believe me, when the program was changed, we received a lot of messages and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was government.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will stick to the inclusion of five matches instead of six – as we usually do. We tried to give more to the fans, but we went too far.
This is an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt “lower” because of his sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daly says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete claims that until he started high school, he didn’t realize that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, led by Lauren Laverne, he spoke about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that when he became a parent, he began to care less about winning the Olympics.
The permanent host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has been in hospital for several months.
While participating in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up, as "it wasn't socially acceptable to like both girls and boys."
“To this day, feeling inferior and being different from others are actually the things that give me the energy and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint anyone when he eventually learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became an active participant in LGBT campaigns and used his participation in this year’s British Community Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he was doing this because he was happy to be able to live openly, without consequences, and wanted to inspire “hope” for others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – the American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – he was “surprised.”
Daly married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but claims the age difference was never a problem.
“When you go through so much while you’re so young,” he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, he said, “it’s hard to find someone your age who has experienced similar ups and downs.”
The two became parents in June and have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daly himself says his "whole worldview" has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have told you that I was only interested in winning a gold medal," he said.
“You know, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father couldn’t accept he was going to die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to be on the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be there for me, Dad, or the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand until he stopped breathing and at that moment, when I found out he was dead, I finally admitted he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that all my life I’ve dreamed about it – to jump in front of the audience at the Olympics at home. There was no more great feeling,” he said.
It also inspired the selection of his first song, "Proud" by Heather Small, which accompanied him during his preparations for the Olympics and still makes him shudder.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British summer time.
Mikelson’s lost form remains on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to regain his old form if he does not want his record to be associated with failure.
Michelson, who participated in the two-year event for the record-breaking 12th time, was left on the bench by Captain Jim Furrick for the “fourball” and “foursom” matches on Saturday.
Instead of being a major figure in the U.S. team again, the five-time winner of major tournaments spent his day as a fan and training his punches from a distance in the hopes of correcting his weaknesses.
The 48-year-old athlete, who was never even at the top of his career as a straight-line player, is not in optimal shape for Le Golf National’s tough pitch, where a long uneven pitch usually punishes every wrong kick.
And if the pitch itself is not disturbing enough, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will face the precision champion of the British Open, Francesco Molinari, who is on a team with rookie Tommy Fleetwood and strive to win all his four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the 12 singles games, make a strong start, it may turn out that the match of Michelson is absolutely decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his teammate, although he could hardly say anything very different.
"He fully understood his role today, he patted my back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He is confident in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has given so much both in the past and this week.
I probably didn't imagine him playing in just two games.
I expected him to play more, but that’s just how it turned out and we believe we made the right decision.
He wants to be on the golf course and play like everyone else.”
Michelson will improve Nick Faldo’s record for the most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
This could put an end to his career in the Rider Cup, which has never come close to his impressive individual achievements.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equal games, but Furick said his presence brings other benefits to the team that are not measured by numbers.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s witty, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great person for any team,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him, especially this week.
He gives so much more than just to play.”
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, is aware that the great lead may soon be melted.
Team Europe captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from personal experience that the big lead accumulated before the singles matches of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be erased.
The Dane made his debut at Valderrama in 1997, when the team with Captain Seve Balisteros led five points ahead of the Americans, but exactly on the final straight was almost overtaken and barely managed to hold the victory by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama we won, but very hard,” Björn said after the 2018 European team won by 5-3 sessions on Friday and yesterday.
So the story has to show both me and everyone on the team that it’s not over.
Be ready to attack tomorrow.
Go out and do what you have to do.
Nothing is over until you see the final score on the dashboard.
We have a goal and it’s to try to win this trophy and that’s exactly what we need to stay focused on.
I kept saying that I only think about the 12 players in our team, but we are also aware of our rivals, who are some of the greatest players in the world.”
Satisfied with the players’ performance on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never rush the celebrations.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow, individual performances will come out in the foreground, and that is different.
It is great to be there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out alone, then you put to the test all your capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you need to get to the players: tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now you can turn your back on your partner, as he too has to be dealt out to the end.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furrick will ask his players to perform better individually than as partners, with the exception of only Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four possible points.
Furik himself was on both sides of these big reversals on the last day – he was part of the triumph of Brookline, and then he was on the losing side when the Europeans performed the Miracle of Medinah.
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, took his players to the final day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good to make the same good start as you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When the advantage passes from one direction to the other, these intermediate matches are played under tremendous pressure.
That’s why we shaped our squad and distributed our boys the way we wanted them to try to do the impossible tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of leading our counterattack and facing Rory McIlroy in the most important match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter will meet the other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
“I chose these players in that order because I think it gives us the best chance of success,” Björn said of his choice for the singles.
Germany has postponed the launch of a new warship.
The latest frigate of the German fleet was to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War-era obsolete warships, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and booming costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the brand’s new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quoted an army spokesman as saying.
The vessel was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after its delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is understandable that they will have a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, e.g. reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – the latest frigates must be able to be used for up to two years before returning to ports of residence.
But the constant delays mean that the avant-garde warships — which are said to allow Germany to demonstrate power overseas — will be old when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 entered the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware defects" that make the warship unusable if sent on a combat mission.
The software drawbacks are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship was significantly overloaded, which reduced its efficiency and limited the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of ships of this class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – also becomes a problem.
It is estimated to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval forces are shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy was in fact "depleting itself from ships capable of carrying out missions".
The official said the problem had become bigger over time as the old ships were decommissioned but no new ones were provided.
He complained that no frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the fleet.
The National Trust monitors the secret life of bats
A new study, carried out at a mansion in the Scottish mountains, aims to find out how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation actions.
The study by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland will follow the common bats, as well as brown-eared water-nostrils at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations in the mansion to track bat activities during the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of call sounds of bats, as well as which species issue them.
A habitat map and report will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work, e.g. meadow creation, as well as the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction activities that affect their shelters and lead to habitat loss.
Populations may be at risk from wind turbines and lighting, aircraft and some chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use advanced echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles along their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of great importance and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
The Trust has trained experts who conduct regular surveys, shelter inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even established the first and only special bat reserve in the Three Mansion in the Dumfries and Galway area, which is home to eight of the ten bat species in Scotland.
The manor manager, David Thompson, says it's the perfect territory for them.
“Here at Threeve, we have great bat terrain,” he said.
“We have old buildings, many old trees and a suitable habitat.
But there are many more things about bats that are not known, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check for the presence of bats before property maintenance activities are carried out, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of one shelter would kill up to 400 female and young bats, as well as destroy an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their shelters.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "I still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our animal species, because we just don't know what happens to their populations."
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape and Lawyers Will Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as "fake news", saying people "want to become famous" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published these allegations.
The assailant of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to silence the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram video, referring to his 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations were posted, Ronaldo, 33, branded the post as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said about me today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said in front of the camera.
“They want to be famous by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to gain popularity on my back, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy person and everything is fine,” the footballer smiled.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for what they call “unacceptable privacy allegations,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damages in an amount consistent with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told her that he was a “good boy” at “99 percent”, but in this case he simply succumbed to “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but this happened with her consent.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "horrified by revenge" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to cancel the deal as she continues to live with the trauma of the incident in question.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Grand Juventus for the sum of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “regret forever” for losing car manufacturers
Britain will “regret forever” if it loses its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” he said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of the border delay in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, where the Auris and Avensis models are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have voiced concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement and how cross-border trade will work.
BMW, for example, say it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are related to the risks to the supply chain in cases of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers from both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be problems at the border, which industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to wait more than a day to complete its inventory at the Darbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's "chess" plan for a future relationship with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks."
“We need to have a deal. We want to make the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to be able to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today program.
“Following the claims not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers, we are absolutely convinced that we must be able to continue to provide successful supply chains.”
Toyota cannot say how long production will be halted, but in the longer term it warns that additional costs will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the founder of Unite at the plant, said that its members are increasingly worried: “I judge from my experience that if these jobs go away, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump-Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again, White House says
An extremely important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh continues his fight, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general or not, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors about Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this claim.
But last Monday, he went to the White House after reports that he would resign.
Instead, while Trump was at the United Nations headquarters in New York, a meeting with him was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, as both Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into Kavanaugh’s complaints, further delaying the Senate’s full vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “It may not be a date yet, it may be this week, but seeing all the other things that are happening in the Supreme Court, I think it may be postponed until next week.
But we’ll see, and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason.
Sanders responded that the rare press conferences were not due to dislike for the "demonstrative behavior" of television journalists, although he shared: "I can't say that I don't agree with the fact that they have demonstrative behavior."
She then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more question and answer sessions than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing evidence: “We checked these statistics.”
“There will still be press conferences,” Sanders continued, “but if press representatives have a chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, and you’ve seen us practice it quite often in recent weeks, and that will replace press conferences once you have the opportunity to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Self-conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, with his eccentric and occasional strange behavior in front of the assembled journalists.
Health Minister Addresses EU Workers at Scotland’s National Health Service on Brexit Fears
The health minister has written to EU staff working for Scotland’s National Health Service to express the state’s appreciation and desire to keep them in their post-Brexit seats.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter in less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to the costs of the established procedures for the status of EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on leaving have continued, with decisions expected this autumn.
But the UK government is also making progress in its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I'm sure this is a very uncertain period for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues across the EU and beyond contribute with valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers' linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's match when his team lost to Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27, the Tennessee Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State’s senior coach Rod Reid told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He went to the sidelines and somehow just fainted there,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical personnel delivered oxygen to Abercrombie on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher and taken to the dressing rooms for further examination.
A Tennessee State official confirmed to Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore with a college scholarship, is for his first season in Tennessee State after his transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday, he made a total of five blockades before leaving the match, making a total of 18 blockades for him this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK
Under new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional funds to help the homeless.
This move will neutralize Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise more than <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today the decision of foreign buyers to pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, with additional income going to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters by promising more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in the stamp tax will affect individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional revenue will help the government’s efforts to limit the number of people sleeping on the street.
The supplement – which is an addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second homes and properties purchased for lease – could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury expects revenues to rise by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of newly built buildings in London are purchased by people with citizenship outside the UK, leading to price hikes and making it difficult for first-time buyers to intervene in the property market.
Many of the rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people own their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high property prices by plundering land but not using it, and asked Mrs May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “household embarrassment.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to “no-fault” expulsions.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I shared that I would like to dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, to buy homes as easily as the hardworking residents of the UK.
For too many people, the dream of owning their own home has gone too far in time, and the insult of sleeping on the street remains too realistic.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to lead the team in Scotland”
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "greatest ambition" in his career was to be the head coach of Scotland's national team.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge to revive the club from northeast England, which is currently in third position in the Premier League, three points from the first place.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I recorded one game for the B team and that was it,” Ross told BBC Sportsound.
“But I grew up with the Scottish Hampden games, which my father and I watched as a child, so the national team has always attracted me.
“But this opportunity would only open up if I had success at the club level.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloe Athletic's former mentor said he was not worried about being the successor to such established names at such a famous club, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will now be measured by a positive answer to the question ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Because in structure, base and conditions he is undoubtedly at the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It won’t be easy to get back to the highest level of football, but I will accept that I have achieved success here only if I can bring the team back there.”
Ross has only been a manager for three years after spending some time as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months at Harts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloe avoid falling into the Third Division and turned St. Mirren from a relegated team into a Champions League winner the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his career as a footballer in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I was really at a crossroads," he remembers the time he took Aloe.
“I really believed that being a manager was the best field for me, including being an active player.
It sounds strange because I did well, I made good money, and I had some significant successes.
But being a player is sometimes hard.
There are a lot of things you have to deal with every week.
I’m still facing the same levels of stress and strain at work, but I just feel that being a manager is the right direction for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager, and now that I’m really doing it, I’ve never felt more comfortable in my skin in my entire conscious life.”

The ideal time for beer is 5:30pm on Saturday, reveals a study
The summer heat has increased the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has accrued more strain on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups reported a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant revenues fell 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, the business consultancy that compiled the statistics, said: “Due to the long sunny weather and longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup, in July follows a similar pattern as in June, when pubs reported an increase of 2.8 percent, but restaurants received an even stronger blow.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant business in June only deepened in July.
Pubs and drink bars reported the best results in their growth, compared to the downward movement of restaurants.
Pubs with meals also suffered from the sunny weather, but not as much as restaurant owners.
Looks like people just wanted to go out and have a drink.
In pubs and bars, beverage sales jumped 6.6 percent per month, while food sales dropped 3 percent.”
Paul Newman, from RSM’s Recreation and Entertainment Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend that we saw in late April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home service sector.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to suffer, although a 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales can be particularly painful in addition to constant costs.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food managers and only time will show whether the more temperate temperatures we experienced in August will bring the much-desired rest.”
Total sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including newly discovered ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployment.

One in five children hides a secret social media profile from their parents
One in five children—some as young as 11—have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers, a study found.
A study of 20,000 high school students shows the growth of fake Insta pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “basic” profile that they showed to their parents.
One in five children—some at age 11—create a social media account that keeps it a secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in fake Insta accounts – a reference to Instagram’s photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “basic” profile that they showed to their parents, while also having secret profiles.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenage child that encouraged others to “rape” him.
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Conference of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping their profiles secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eileed Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the Board of Athletics in Scotland
Eileed Doyle was chosen to join the Board of Athletics in Scotland as the non-executive director of the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most accomplished athlete, and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those leading in the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilede enjoys great respect in the athletic communities of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from attracting her,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I have a desire to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to promote sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the finals of the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996, adding to his four Olympic gold medals, and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, lost the ability to walk after receiving a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I achieved a full recovery, I learned to walk again and today I do mobility training!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows, divide online reviews
A company that produces breast pumps has split online reviews with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows that are breastfed.
To mark the launch of the expected “world’s first silent breast pump suitable for carrying,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched a humorous music-video ad to demonstrate the freedom that the new pump gives nursing mothers to perform.
Four real mothers dance in a cowshed full of hay against the backdrop of a song with lyrics including “Yes, I’m milking but you don’t see any tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a udder, it’s my breasts.”
The chant continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies with them, pump, pump, milk my girlfriends.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page caused online disagreements.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many claiming to downplay the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very stupid decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies take them away a few days after birth.”

Another comment: “It is understandable that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast-feeding pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added, “So much inadequate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she thought the song was “extremely funny.”
“I think the idea is genius.
I'd buy one if I was still breastfeeding.
Squeezing made me feel just like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I accept it as it is.
This product is brilliant,” someone wrote.
Another comment: “This is a funny ad aimed at mothers who are sewing (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like “cows”.
This is not advertising that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they danced with discrete pumps placed in their bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the view that many women who breastfeed feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and gathers discreetly in a breastfeeding bra that gives women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they are being squeezed out.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to breast-feeding and all the challenges associated with it, while showing in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This isn’t the first time the Elvie pump has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved Secretly to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has jumped sharply, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with guardians.
Usually, most guardians are undocumented immigrants who are afraid of risking their stay in the country if they want to recognize a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guardians and other adults in the family had to provide fingerprints, which data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who wanted to become guardians of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either guardians or family members of guardians reside illegally in the country, with a large proportion of them being foreign criminals.
So we will continue to pursue these individuals," Albens said.
In an effort to deal more quickly with the registration of these children, authorities have imposed new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was the previous rule, according to shelter officials.
Many appear in a video conference call, not in person, to present their case for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed unfit for admission will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to become depressed or depressed, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter officials and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that this concern is growing at large facilities, such as in Tornillo, where signs that a child is having problems are more likely to be ignored due to the scale of the site.
They added that moving children to “the tent city” without giving them enough time to prepare on an emotional level or to say goodbye to their friends could aggravate the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish “occupation troops” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the civil war has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were illegally staying on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “should be taken appropriate action.”
"They must be withdrawn immediately and without any conditions," he said at the meeting.
Muallem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011 and millions have been forcibly displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until all Syrian lands are cleared” by both terrorist organizations and “any illegal alien presence.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the lands of the war-ravaged country.
Regarding refugees, Muallem said the conditions were bearable and could return, accusing "some Western countries of inflaming groundless fears" that prompt refugees to stand aside.
"We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in these returns," he said.
“They are turning into a political issue something that is purely a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no assistance will be provided to rebuild Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to stop the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib provides an opportunity for progress in political dialogues.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces over the province, where three million people live.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft Syria’s post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to a "review of the articles of the current constitution" and warned that there should be no interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By this logic, Trump will win a re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal spectators probably hope, his presidency is terminated prematurely due to impeachment and scandal.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the Primetime rating has doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during primetime, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” is at the top of the cable TV ratings, with up to 3.5 million viewers at big news dinners.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Bayer, executive producer of ABC’s drama The Last Candidate, which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club,” has another theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked, “Why?”
Mrs. Scovel told me that he replied, "Because he makes me laugh."
There's fun in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of Rowe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite, and the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, the desire to be an informed citizen does not match that of watching a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward, who uses "deep historical information" as a source for his book Fear; Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich-skinned pilot's jacket.
I'll never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like part of a reality show is giving you a little bit every night,” said Brent Montgomery, chief executive producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, in terms of shifting participants and daily twists.
You can't afford to miss an episode because you're going to be lagging behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny on the north coast of Kauai, 80 degrees, but he had closed home to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t be separated from the television, especially when Brett Cavanaugh had to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court depended on it.
“I remember one time we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Investments pour into the most contested race in the early elections for a seat in Congress
Not surprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania received a stream of money, thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts and hence two titulars to the same place.
The recently redistributed district in the suburbs of Pittsburgh points to conservative Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat from another district in a partial election last spring.
Lamb faces another titular, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is significantly in favor of the new 17th.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district sparked a financial dispute between the party’s main funding institutions, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Commission (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Commission (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely debated March partial elections for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The position was taken by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts believe that Democrats have a slight advantage.
U.S. Considers Imposing Sanctions on El Salvador Over Its Support for China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners fired the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only foreseen against El Salvador, which in 2017 received about $140 million in U.S. aid to combat drugs for development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American state with its unemployment and murder rate.
As domestic meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, which served as a continuation of a similar gathering last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent an influx of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior governing bodies said they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any discussion of sanctions against El Salvador.
Now Vice President Mike Pence has announced that he will participate in a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
All three U.S. envoys have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who wished to remain anonymous, who agreed to participate in internal discussions.
Their stories were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wished to remain anonymous.
History of the study
The next move could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, with the report currently being a significant piece of evidence in the public register.
It is alleged that Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump conspired with Russia during his campaign to attack our elections.
If the leadership of Congress changes, it will turn out that Mr. Trump will have to report to this body just as he is preparing to face voters, and perhaps to a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are many unknowns here, and I don’t suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of those like him in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make these choices that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler, as long as the West had opposed him and had supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the subsequent years of the massacre.
The course of history depends on such milestones, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are currently facing several such nodes.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the story in The Times was inaccurate.
“How would we react if the new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, requested by the FBI, is not complete or fair – or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the early congressional elections if that forces Mr. Trump to take responsibility?
If we fail these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail, because I learned a lesson from Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was taken to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sabbath candles on that table, wearing a swastika.
With a legacy like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the collision with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month will give them a significant chance to continue ahead of Group D of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from playing his first match of the season before the 2-2 draw in question against Villarreal, but he believes that for the Rangers this result could become a springboard for greater achievements.
“We won an important point because Villarreal are a good opponent,” the 31-year-old said.
“We entered the game in the hope that we could win something and left with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end of the match, but overall the equality seems to be a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we were better in the second.
We looked at Thursday, another big night of our games in Europe.
I hope that we will be able to fight for the three points, it will be a difficult match because they achieved a good result in the last meeting, but I am sure that with the support of our audience we can do our best and achieve a good result.
“Last year was definitely tough after everything that happened with my injuries and changes at the club, but now things seem to have gone in the right direction.
The team is good and the boys really have fun, the training is fruitful.
I hope that we will be able to use all our strength to forget last season and achieve the desired success."
Women are worried about their retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of what care they wanted to receive, few people discussed this with family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they had discussed with their husbands the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent have spoken to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but have not taken steps to hold this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's what you can start with.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide you with care if you don’t state your wishes in advance.
Together with your counselor and your family, discuss where and how you want to receive care, as these decisions can be a decisive factor in determining costs.
Turn on your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you with an idea of how to pay these costs.
Your decisions when choosing a financial institution for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a cash-valued mixed life insurance policy to help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your funds – if you have the cash resources.
Prepare your legal documents: Deal with legal battles from the beginning.
Appoint a health care attorney so that you have a designated trustee to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the idea of a financial advisor.
You can choose a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs urgent medical attention and travels to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Put these details in writing so that you are prepared.
“It’s not just about the financial aspect, it’s about who the doctors will be,” Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

The victim was unable to see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are trying to get witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the disconnected communications, aid organizations are unable to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some basic facts about Palu and Dongala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow beach on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is an administrative region smaller than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the foundations of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to data from the Indonesian Disaster Recovery Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of buildings in Dongala.
The tsunami struck the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic "Pacific Ring of Fire" and is regularly mown by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in North Sumatra triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the entire coastline of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake mows Indonesia’s most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that crashed in the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake strikes near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake decimated one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a 10-metre tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Paddy Jaya Regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes rocked the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report by Alaska State Police published on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin was detained in the Mat-Su pre-detention building and under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday where he pleaded "innocent, certainly" when asked for a plea, the media reported.
Palin is threatened with three class A misdemeanors, which means he can be jailed for up to a year and pay a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a class B misdemeanor, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently being examined by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in reporting a domestic violence crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend says he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s aggressive behavior to post-traumatic stress arising from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that decimated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta.
In social networks, videos are rotated that show the moment of the collision.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu when a tsunami wave hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out the October attack on a bicycle lane near the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, treading pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To acquit the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused severe bodily harm, according to a notice of intent in connection with a death penalty application filed in the South District of New York.
According to the court document, both charges could end in the death penalty.
Weeks after the attack, an expanded federal court panel filed a 22-point indictment against Saipov, including eight racketeering murder charges routinely used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
The attack required “serious planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s conduct as “terrible, cruel and perverse.”
Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, An-Lori Decade, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Hernan Felucci and Alejandro Damian Panuko.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York sought the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers but was subsequently sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a federal death sentence was carried out in New York was in 1953 by Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek by nationality, showed no remorse in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment alleges.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be placed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to a 22-point indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“In our view, the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a sentence of guilty and life imprisonment without the possibility of early release will only prolong the traumatic effect of these events for all those affected,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to seek a death sentence.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Lead Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people” today, during a protest at a Conservative conference.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” – as one of Theresa May’s own party members suggested he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bon, a Conservative MP, said in March in Birmingham that Britain "would have left by now" if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But Mrs May’s challenge to come to terms with the party’s deeply divided ranks has been highlighted by conservatives who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep his Chequers compromise plan, despite attacks by Brexit-supporting, EU-remaining, and others.
Allies insist that it will make progress in its bid to reach a deal with Brussels despite hostile reactions, and insist that Eurosceptics and Labour choose between its package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bon told protesters with the slogan “Leaving means going out” in Solihull that he wanted to “throw away Chequers”.
He pointed out that Mr Farage should have participated on an equal footing with the others and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we would have left by now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to reject the Chequers plan.
Declaring his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be servile.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bon rejected claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The notion that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely false.”
Conservative spokeswoman Andrea Jenkins also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and our activists, who actually took to the streets and actually helped us to be elected.
Please leave "Chequers" and start listening."
In an open message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their position when they keep their promises.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they intend to change the decision taken after the 2016 referendum.
“It’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to change Brexit, and we’re here today to say, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of changing Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that helped us win Brexit, and we will never stop until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, supporters of the remainder marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
A handful of activists had raised flags reading “Conservatives Against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for the party's application security issues when he opened up at the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can deploy Canada’s IT systems and all of Canada’s technology and more, and more, for unhindered border crossing, for borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren says he will “consider seriously” his candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe said the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a city council meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a constant critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Representative Jeff Deale, who was joint chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She is at the center of speculation that she could take over Trump’s post in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the City Hall building after Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren said it was time for “women to go to Washington and repair our damaged government, and that includes women at the top.”
He was arrested for the death of Sims from the LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in Friday’s shooting when LSU basketball player Wade Sims was killed.
Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20, during a press conference at 11:00 Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the footage.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the South University area early Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head, which ultimately led to his death,” Murphy police chief J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested and detained in the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A 6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>6<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> young man, raised in Baton Rouge – Sims has played in 32 games with 10 appearances as the title holder last season and recorded an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 fights per match.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton is getting closer to the world title, after the instructions of the team helped him to beat Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the guidance from the Mercedes team would play an important role in the race.
Bottas made a good start from the first position and seriously worried Hamilton while defending his position in the first two corners, thus enabling Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to make a pit stop and let Hamilton deal with the traffic at the end of the column, which seemed to be crucial to the outcome of the race.
The Mercedes also made a pit stop on the next lap and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton managed to overtake him after a daring maneuver and driving "rubber to tire", which forced the Ferrari pilot with reluctance to release the inside of the track, in order to avoid punishment with extra time, having already closed the path of his opponent on a dangerous double manra.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back rows of the grid and was seventh after the end of the first lap.
He then even led the race for a long period of time, as he had decided to change his tyres later than the others, which would have allowed him to be faster at the end of the race and possibly overtake Kimi Raikkonen in the fourth-place battle.
He finally entered for a pit stop in the 44th lap, but failed to catch up enough in the next eight laps and eventually Raikkonen finished fourth.
It’s been a tough day since Walteri did a great job all weekend and showed himself to be a real gentleman when he let me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job to win the first two podium places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she had not circulated a letter from Christine Blazey Ford accusing Supreme Court contender Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented how what was happening in the Senate showed people were “evil and disgusting and dishonest.”
“What can happen and the good things that happen in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry people and evil and disgusting and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publications and distributions, and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you spread it?
Do you remember her answer... Did you release the document – “Oh, um, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't distribute it."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was circulated earlier in September – but Feinstein denies that the spread had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Ford’s claims, I didn’t spread her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it private and I kept it private as she wished.”
But her denial was not well received by the president, who commented during the rally on Saturday night: “I’ll tell you that it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual offences against three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means possible.
Look at the dishonor, the shamelessness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars returned for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, beating Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants led the match early with two goals after hitting Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney equalized for the hosts before Dwyer regained the lead of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals solidified their victory.
This is the third victory in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who slipped from the bottom to beat Dundee in Belfast by 2-1 Friday night.
It was the fourth clash between opponents this season, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
The shot with which Dwyer found the result came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assistance, and then David Rutherford doubled the advance, assisting Bovillier four minutes later.
It was a tense start, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Markart helped out with the help of Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer tried to lead the Giants before the first break, scoring a second goal for the evening at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bushar again equalized the chances with a powerful blow to the door at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nilsen give Dundee the lead for the first time this match at the end of the second half, he gave his best and solidified the team's victory with the fifth goal in the middle but the last half.
The Giants, who lost their last four games in a total of five games, welcomed Milton Keynes as hosts for their next match on Friday.
A flight manager has died to make sure hundreds of people aboard the plane can escape an earthquake.
An Indonesian flight manager has been hailed as a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of passengers on board was able to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing in a powerful earthquake that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami wave.
Strong aftershocks continued to plague the area, and many were trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the heavily shaking control tower at Mutiara Sis al-Jufrey Airport.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be able to take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he decided it was going down.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Control spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts were broken when we heard about it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands after the country's disaster response agency announced that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Button is limited.
"We expect the death toll to rise as many bodies are still under the rubble and many people cannot be reached," Sutopo spokesman Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves that reached six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral was held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.
There's looting everywhere in the mini-markets."
Jan Gelfand, chairman of the International Red Cross Movement in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is struggling to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country’s army: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini announces missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which carried out a flight on a plane that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean, now reports that one person has been declared missing after saying earlier that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a press release, Air Niugini said it had been unable to contact a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, e.g. age and nationality.
Boats of local people helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been admitted to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had passed the runway.
American Bill Janes, a passenger on the plane, claims that the plane went very low.
“It’s very good,” Janet said.
Janes says that he and the others were able to run through the deep water to the waist to reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy says seamen repairing a nearby port also helped in the rescue operation, using an inflatable boat to get people to shore before the plane sank in the deep waters of about 30 meters (100 feet).
Data from the Safe Aviation Network indicate that in the last two decades, 111 people have died on flights with airlines registered to PNG, but Air Niugini is not involved in any case.
Analyzer exposes the chronology of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecutor’s office concluded its statement on the case this Saturday in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to assemble the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Thelis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Roulett said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contrary to his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate that they had only known each other for a week.
Roulett said shortly after Chambers’ death, Telis deleted her text messages, calls and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin with its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be presented to the jury later that day.

Another black man?
New York babysitter sues couple after being fired for ‘racist’ message
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for dismissal for discrimination after receiving an erroneous message from her mother complaining that she is “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, equating the claim to “extortion.”
Linzi Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was stunned when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was black when she arrived for her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the embarrassing Mrs. Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, saying that the previous nanny, who was an African-American, was not doing her job well and that she was expecting a Filipina, The New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris received a paycheck for one working day and was then sent home by taxi.
Morris is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal, demanding the sum of $350 per day for the six-month arrangement for which she was originally hired, even though she did not have a contract.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “You’re sure it’s discrimination.”
In response to the request, the couple claimed they were not racist, adding that the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable act, as they feared that they would not be able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn?
Think about it."
Similar to the claim of “extortion,” Plasco claims that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this state?
That's not particularly nice," the investment banker added.
While the court case is still pending, public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, reprimanding them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t feel connected to a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Yankel, born shortly after the book was accepted by the public, relates about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it’s published.
It’s a lot of fun now that we’re aware of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little bear-toy, would have felt optimistic about a possible rejection of the book, adding that he was welcoming the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "with mixed feelings" after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "an important member of our family," she added that her father secretly felt proud of the final success.
“He was a very modest man and he was not self-praising,” she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it’s like having a child who’s accomplished something: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not really your doing.
I think he kind of accepted Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors struggled in vain to save her life.
“He kept ringing to say that the situation was really bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” said Mrs. Eden-Laperouse.
“After that, Nad called me to say that he was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said to her, "Tashi, darling, I love you so much.
I'll come to you soon.
I'll come to you.
The medications given to her by doctors to support her heart slowly stop working and leave her system.
She's gone a while before that, and that's how it's all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, realizing that all this was happening.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to get tight.”
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperouse, who still mourns the loss of her daughter, gets on the plane with the other passengers, who have no idea of the test she is going through.
“Nobody understood,” she said.
“I was bowing my head and all the time my tears were dripping.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight I felt this all-consuming feeling of empathy with Over.
That he needs my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women put on postcards to prevent suicides from a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other suicides.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put on a bridge in Wales postcards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to get help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, says her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile brightens every room.”
However, he gave up his job before he left, and was in a “truly dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that this will have consequences.”
Mrs. Davis created the cards “to let people know that there’s someone to go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her companion in life for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t share that he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them or anything."
She said it was a terrible trauma for them, but they had to deal with it: “It opens a gap in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question after FBI investigates
I wondered if we could really achieve what he wanted – a limited-duration and limited-scope investigation – maybe we could pool our efforts,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “failing” despite a hardened cross-party blockade.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is because of the moment itself.
Early elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 – if Republicans are not expected to perform well, their attempts to elect their representative to the country’s highest court will be seriously affected.
George W. Bush called the senators, inviting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who works for Mr. Bush at the White House, and with his help he met his wife, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI drafts its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to declare equality and confirm his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s ‘reduction’ in number of refugees under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago.
Park Bieong Sug, citing data from the South Korean Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 refugees last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
According to Mr. Park, tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher amounts demanded by human smugglers, are key factors.
There is no official comment from Pyongyang.
The majority of refugees from the North eventually obtain citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, where it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two Koreas.
China regards refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, often forcibly repatriating them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks focused on a stalemate in nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed to basically work for the Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
“In the absence of trust in the United States, we will not be confident in our national security and under these circumstances there is no way to disarm ourselves unilaterally first,” Ree said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Congressional minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was too unbalanced to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented on this during an interview this Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“There was no way I wouldn’t have thought that if a woman had reacted this way, they would have called her ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected claims that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, at times he almost shouted and was moved when discussing his family and his school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality” orchestrated by liberals who are dissatisfied that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was unable to work in the Supreme Court because it had become clear that he was biased against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with these allegations and the way he pursues the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi denied when asked if she would try to discredit Kavanaugh if he was appointed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to go to the Supreme Court, he’s unfit to go to the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential rulings regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Rowe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In the preliminary hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would reject certain Supreme Court rulings.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that great,’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be mastered.
This is a reasonable criticism, after months and years of spreading rage, and she cannot accept it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinam told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, do you?”
She went on, “I got huge help from a woman who was CEO somewhere who shared that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed her technique, thanks to which when she got angry and cried, she said to her interlocutor, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it just goes on.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed when anger is expressed, in part because they are misunderstood in the beginning.
One of my clearest memories of a previous job, in an office mostly with men, is how once, as I snarled with inexpressible rage, an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a chilling boss I was always a little afraid of – and she dragged me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy they did it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship on a yacht called “Monkey Business” and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they wanted to happen was to have another one.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
As she joined the campaign late, she was lagging behind in raising funds and decided that she would not stay in the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
The battle is predestined to fail.
She realizes that some of her supporters, who give $1,000 to men, would only give $250 to her.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
During her speech, in which she stated that she would not continue with the official campaign, she was overwhelmed by so many feelings – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and be able to turn to voters rather than delegates, and anger against sexism that she felt.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” recalls Mrs Schroeder, as the media reacted.
“Someone might think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China trade war could serve Beijing
The first shots in the U.S.-China trade war were deafening and while the battle is still gaining momentum, a rift between the two countries will benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warning salvo this year by taxing key elements of China’s exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation of tensions came this week with new tariffs affecting output of US$200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) with effective taxation of half of all goods imported into the US from China.
Each time, Beijing countered new tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to retaliate against every U.S. strike, and the world’s second-largest economy is not expected to ignore it anytime soon.
To get Washington to give up is to give in to the demands, but to bring the head down publicly in front of Washington would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say, if Beijing plays its cards right, pressure from the trade war with the United States could help China reduce the mutual dependence of the two economies in the long run.
“The fact that a hasty political decision in both Washington and Beijing could create the conditions for an economic crisis in either country is actually more dangerous than observers previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher on Asia-related issues at the Center for a New American Security expert group.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for assistance in rebuilding the country devastated by the war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists to bring them back to normal.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living there are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional aid or assistance from countries that funded the rebels would not be accepted.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the outskirts of Paris, France.
The U.S. has suffered six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the championship crown in the tournament after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the necessary 14.5 points, which guaranteed victory over the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelson, who performed poorly during most of the tournament, threw his first punch on the 16th hole (with a "pair" of 3) in the water, losing his match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed excellently in all rounds, becoming one of four players in the history of the tournament to reach a 5-0-0 balance since the race was held in the current format after 1979.
The American Jordan Spite lost categorically with 5&4 from the player in the team of Europe, which is in the lowest place in the ranking – Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
World ranking leader Dustin Johnson lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, for whom this is probably the last participation in the Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran with eight Ryder Cup appearances, became the European with the most points won in the tournament at all times, increasing his assets to 25.5 points this year.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t restrain myself.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for calling me and believing in me.
I'm so glad I can pick up the bowl again.
“The most important thing is the team and I’m happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said.
He handed the baton to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American legend Tiger Woods with 2&1 singles on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, yet I grew up watching him play,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and his overall balance at the Ryder Cup is already 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, winning 14 major titles – an indicator in which he is inferior only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-class golf on all days of the tournament.
Team captain Jim Furrick said after the disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
At one point this morning we pushed the team of Europe.
There was a battle.
I'm taking Thomas' hat off.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players performed very well.
We will regroup, discuss important issues with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and our Rider Cup Committee, and we will only look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
There's no way you can't take your opponent's hat off.
We were just outplayed.”
