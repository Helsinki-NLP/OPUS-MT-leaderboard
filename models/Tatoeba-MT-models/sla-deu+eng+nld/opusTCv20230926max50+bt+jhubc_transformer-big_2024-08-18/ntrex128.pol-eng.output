Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
This is the result of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea arose in connection with the plans to rename the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the object of ridicule.
One Labour MP voiced concerns about his group, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, the word “twp” means fool, and the word “pwp” means faeces.
One of the party’s politicians, Plaid Cymru, said his group was “unsatisfied” with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to a name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English dialect of Yorkshire.
The committee working within the assembly, which is currently working on a draft law changing the name, took the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposal. The renaming of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained wide support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" was the most popular among the public.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions. Difficulties with reaching a consensus are a nuisance for Elin Jones, the speaker of the assembly, who is due to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the assembly works, including the principles of dismissal of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the law.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country’s name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor constitutes a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change is necessary to allow the country to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in New York’s St. Martin’s Church will be silenced due to problems affecting churches in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
"There's no sign of them now."
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people socialize in a different way,” he noted.
“Bars have ceased to be a place for regular meetings of members of the community.”
In the case of churches, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as decision-makers think, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the total closure of churches, since it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a white congregation of believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (the church of St. Martin joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The nearby African-American assembly then took ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against the 125th Street (Harlem's main shopping street) vendors opposed to hiring or promoting African-Americans.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, however, the parishioners of John Howard Johnson made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell complex.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the new carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert, who knocked the bells in July, described them in a different way, as a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world served by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that the church of St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there have been a number of complicated events involving architects and performers in St. Martin’s Church, some of which have been brought to the site by lay leaders of the church and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish made up of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it “wants to shift costs to the council,” although the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Diver in Search of Lobster in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old diving in search of lobsters in California. The event occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard a cry for help.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the baby was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Upon reaching the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had a completely torn skin around his collarbone.
“I started shouting to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Children's Hospital in San Diego. His condition was described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, rescuer Captain Larry Giles said that the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was recognized that it was not a species of dangerous sharks.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to his upper torso.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is inhabited by more than 135 species of sharks, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's stores chain plans to expand operations in the UK cosmetics market
The Sainsbury's chain throws a glove at stores like Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing style-based beauty departments to its supermarkets, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly growing despite declines in the fashion and household goods industry – 11 stores in the network will have larger shelves with cosmetic products. If the initiative succeeds next year, the activities will be extended to other points.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to develop the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household products.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 products. For the first time, the range will include products from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space and separate areas similar to the well-known Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its range of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points at two Sainsbury’s supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said sales outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight discounters like Aldi or Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and is introducing a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of the two companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increasing food sales and increasing the profitability of investments.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots on a trial basis. However, the cooperation ended after a conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is launching a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores of the chain.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have redesigned the appearance and character of the cosmetics department to improve the customer experience.
We have invested in special training for co-workers so they can help consumers when shopping.
Our brands are able to meet every need, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to challenge the existing ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, was “outraged” when he learned that Holly Willoughby was going to pull out of the <0xC2><0xA3>11m lifestyle brand to focus on a re-established collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand offering household accessories and items under the name Truly.
The activity has often been compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, the 37-year-old spokeswoman announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave a thriving lifestyle brand and focus on a re-established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV made by Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of the show Dragons' Den.
According to the sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to devote himself to their brand offering Truly household accessories and articles.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was also set to double Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After 37-year-old Holly Willoughby announced his decision to leave Truly on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK on his way to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She tied her future to it and wanted to take care of it for the next several decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was so close to entering the market.
The Marlow Warehouse is stocked with ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the resignation of this Morning presenter and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including items from pillows to candles to clothing and household items – as well as further delays in entering the market.
It can also mean the end of a long-lasting friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded the Truly brand in 2016, and Peter Jones, 52, joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones held a 40 percent stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become M&S ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the criticism of the media caused by the attention, which some considered “disappointing to the man of the state”, as well as a positive attitude to the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a television presenter:
“I gave up nothing.”
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “analogous response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and exerts pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We are doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We planned a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had brought positive results: they led to the end of missile tests, helped to free hostages and returned the remaining American soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing the relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside trying to get into a crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing his finger at the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities did not declare a natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international relief efforts.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not demanding international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain that international staff will be able to act on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks that are constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh province in the event of a tsunami, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu – despite issuing a warning – likely affected the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is heading to the city of Palu to help the victims of the earthquake. However, it will take at least three days to reach its destination.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure a major point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year’s elections, the president’s administration is struggling with a lack of resources.
In addition, Joko Widodo has come under pressure due to ongoing religious tensions in the country. Members of the majority Muslim community have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands of residents lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
Liverpool footballer Daniel Sturridge wins a goal in a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 to the detriment of his team.
Before giving a shot towards the distant goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball moved high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the net.
Then she fell into the gate, flying over Kepah Arrizabalaga, who was throwing at her.
“I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to get it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kante coming, I took the ball and gave the shot without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> and then ran towards half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted a pass in the middle of the pitch.
He then made a beautiful forward play in the penalty area back to Hazard.
Gambling overtook the defenders and left foot gave in the direction of the long pole shot, which passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said on Sunday that the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country has risen to 832.
During the conference, a spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that as a result of Friday's 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under the rubble. In addition, the shock caused a tsunami wave of 6 meters.
The city of Palu, inhabited by more than 380,000 people, is full of debris from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing woman
After the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, a homicide investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 with puncture wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. The suspect in the murder of a 32-year-old man was arrested.
Police are asking people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious incident.
Brian O'Hagan, the commissioner for investigation, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to call on all those who were present at the time near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose registrars were able to record materials useful during the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, those claiming to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of informing the victim's family about the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into the apartment building, but was informed by police that it was currently forbidden to enter and leave the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes in the near future.
They heard one of the officers explain to the man that the area is currently considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were in the fenced area, and another police vehicle was parked next door.
Inside the separated zone are officers guarding the residential building.
Persons with information are asked to contact Twitter (<0x40>MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or to report anonymously via Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell monument in front of the British Parliament is the last victim in the dispute about “writing history again”
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban-like actions of destroying many of England’s cultural and religious monuments by its radical, puritanical supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "madness" and "an attempt to re-write history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was a matter of time.
The figurative actions during the English civil wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the monument is a testament to the politician’s reputation in the nineteenth century, and that for many, he is still a figure worth commemorating.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Many people saw Cromwell — perhaps more often in the nineteenth century than now — as a defender of parliament against external pressures.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the parties to the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and commemorated.”
In China, a farmer was killed by a pig.
According to local media, there was a deadly pig attack on a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bloodied and with a severed artery near a barn in a market in the city of Liupanshui, in the province of Kuejchou.
A pig farmer is preparing for vaccination in a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man arrived at the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, the cousin found the man’s body and noticed an open door to a nearby barn.
He said there was a big pig in the kennel with blood on it.
The corpse section confirmed that it was the nearly 250-kilogram pig that fatally mutilated the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and chapped,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance footage shows Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that at the time of gathering evidence by the police, the pig was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Previous cases of swine attacks on humans have been reported, although these are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, a 300-pound pig nailed a farmer to a tractor. The man's wife managed to pull the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by pigs in 2012, one farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can trigger violent behavior in them.
“They just want to have fun.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them the right respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, it will cause heavy rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa is blowing at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 o'clock in the morning, it was given a category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the Pacific Ocean begins to form rather than heading eastward to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving masses of humid air northward, to the southwestern United States.
Monday will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in part of the territory of Mexico.
In the coming days, humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching lower will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwest of the United States.
In some places, rainfall from 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden flooding, the movement of pollution and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause rainfall from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some parts of the Southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rains, it is strongly discouraged to move on foot through the desert area.
Extensive rainfall can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local gusty winds and dust displacements.
Coming before will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of southern California.
Rains with a total height of more than 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small movements of pollutants and road hazards.
This would be the first rainfall so far in the region.
Transient tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoons and Tuesdays, rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western United States and last until Wednesday.
In October, temperature fluctuations may occur in the Arctic region throughout the United States, but it will be rather warm in the intervertebral zone.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature difference in the central United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa), these differences are nearly 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, persistent summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm beginning of October is expected. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to part of the Northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the moving Thursday hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political deadlock on Friday, commentators had to cut off regular broadcasts to inform of a sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% certain that Kavanaugh was groping her in a state of intoxication and trying to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced the situation had not happened.
It is possible that Friday’s number of TV viewers was even higher than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, figures were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences in workplaces.
The given number is similar to the viewership of American football cup competitions or the award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest viewership, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long audition.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the matter remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
In the morning, he was captured by the cameras of CNN and CBS after the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. In the video, he shouts at demonstrators who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on his way to the court hearing committee.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have strength in the face of the impotence of so many women,” he said.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would speak during the committee hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of a vote to hand over Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges next week, as a minority of Democrats insisted.
Flake was persuaded in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans wouldn't have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh’s allegations.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of the UK and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May on the front page, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union following Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could levy tariffs on their own behalf, calling it “completely ridiculous”.
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player Murder
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player playing in the colors of Louisiana State University (LSU).
According to police command in Baton Rouge, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was detained and placed in custody on suspicion of second-degree murder.
Authorities released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police reported that during the fight Sims lost his glasses.
According to CBS-linked WAFB, police officers found the glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
Police said after Simpson was questioned that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer of the detainee, the amount of the deposit was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner's office in East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report claiming that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police's search group, the state police's crime lab, Southern University Police and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for “working hard and striving for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
A 198 cm tall man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re always afraid of,” said Will Wade.
The ashes emitted by the volcano reach the city of Mexico
Ash emanating from the volcano Popocatépetl reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center advised residents not to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center recorded numerous chokings and shocks.
Photos posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash in neighborhoods like Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1 magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between demonstrators in support of Catalonia's independence and preventive police units. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extremely emotional referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked proponents of separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust shrouded the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also occurred later in the day, and the police used sticks to stop the fighting.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive". Opponents of the secession shouted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people received medical care in connection with minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, tensions have not eased. Although the authorities in Madrid have deemed it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the Catalans who want to secession.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but the turnout was low due to a widespread boycott of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in violent clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting police officers.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we had some of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents were crying for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are stuck at a point where there is no way out,” he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in last December’s local elections, parties supporting Catalonia’s secession have difficulty continuing. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting trial in custody in connection with the role played in the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a phone call supporting police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fuelling the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his willingness to take part in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Candidating for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests men after driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car several times by a house in the city of Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British Time (BST).
Investigative commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car could also be shot from the crossbow.
Menga goal ensures Livingston win over the Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team a victory
Livingston, who has been playing for the season, stunned the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard only a second loss in his 18 games as the club's coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal was a winner, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season without a victory on the road to the Premier League. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier, as early as Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston extends the series of victories in his division to six matches. Coach Holt has not suffered a defeat since his replacement last month, Kenny Miller.
Livingston missed several opportunities against indisposed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
First, Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired a shot into the goal light, but he failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed to score after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during the constant fragments of the game.
And this is how the decisive goal fell.
After the Rangers gave up the free throw, the Livingston team found the opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson together created the situation of Menze, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, however, they could not push through the defense of the hosts and did not cause major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired one shot at Kelly's goal in the second half.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal light from another permanent fragment doomed to Livingston.
The Rangers continued their attacks in Livingston's penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty throws after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
Livingston’s “Phenomenal” Performance – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have not changed much since their return to the league. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
The game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the match.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although under the leadership of Gerrard, they have great moments, in this match they did not maintain their standards.
Their game seemed to be missing something: only once they managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During Saturday's breakfast in Berlin (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside their homeland.
Police said a crowd of 25,000 gathered outside the temple was blocked for security reasons, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, including many Kurds, also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of the Turkish leader and the decision of the German government to adopt a politician in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions created by the visit of a politician who has been hailed as a hero by some Turks living in Germany and has been recognized as an autocracy by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist died after colliding with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the southeastern district of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle and ambulances arrived. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred on Childers Street (about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday’s accident).
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working to identify the deceased man and report the incident to family members.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organised, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six Officers Wounded in Riots
According to authorities, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a penitentiary facility for men with an increased level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin penitentiary in Worcestershire began on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British Time (BST) and are still ongoing.
A special unit called Tornado was called for riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant.
Officers at the scene sustained minor injuries to their faces.
A plant spokesman said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at HMP Long Lartin penitentiary facility.
Six officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the head of the facility had to go to the hospital after he was attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was called to the prevention units because of the dangerous riots, in which the workers were attacked with balls to play billiards.
Sudden flooding caused by Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely that this will happen at the beginning of next week. The remnants of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a warning about the possibility of sudden flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, rainfall will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of storm or tropical depression within 320 km of Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the border of Arizona.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm. In some areas of Mogollon Rim in Arizona, they can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the Southwest – including the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin – the precipitation is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
The rainfall that accompanies Hurricane Rosa can bring relief to people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the Southwest, where there is a state of drought.
As reported by weather.com, U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona’s land area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa arrives first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. Currently, it is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with the force of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood risk.
Weather.com reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora, precipitation is expected to be 7 to 15 cm high, although it can reach 25 cm."
Then, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early hours of the morning, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will travel to the southern part of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
According to forecasts, rains will cause life-threatening sudden floods and pollution movements in the desert and muddy avalanches in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested in Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old man found with puncture wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday, around 4:00 a.m. British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to hospital and her condition remains “stable”.
Police from Avon and Somerset reported that a 17-year-old, two-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officers are asked to contact all persons who have recordings of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh 'Smells Ugly and Angry'
“The vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous conduct,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “feared the folly and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. Strongly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, the man sexually assaulted her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “the Americans could see Kavanaugh’s brilliance, class, and courage.”
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support for one of the greatest lawyers of our time, an expert in the law of great merit to the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t run in this election, but I remain very active,” he said.
“I’m still fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “resistance and obstruction.”
As one of the assistants of a prominent Republican politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected on Friday at the latest.
Hundreds of victims of earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed – many of them abducted by high waves crashing into beaches – in the aftermath of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu to take part in the festival taking place in the city. At dusk, waves reaching up to 6 meters high hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was the result of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat came yesterday, people on the beach did not immediately flee and were victims of a tsunami,” BNPD spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami attacked everything in its path, hijacking cars, logs and houses,” Nugroho reported, adding that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at a speed of 800 km/h.
As he said, some saved themselves by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 resorts in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster agency show many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, there have been a number of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Use (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times greater than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement said the city’s geographical location, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people are considered missing.
Nugroho said the deaths and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to Nugroho, the communication "has been completely paralyzed", and therefore there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s staff and volunteers were heading to disaster-stricken areas.
“We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation may deteriorate significantly,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said that the waves came just after the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming from a building trying to warn of an impending tsunami of people on the street.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, hijacking buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in electricity supply, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, however, the evacuated people still greatly need food and other basic necessities.
The airport, located in the city, is open only for humanitarian aid. The airport will remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
More than 800 victims of tsunami in Indonesia
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinai, National Director of World Vision, the organization’s staff arrived safely from Donggala Province to the city of Palu and found shelter in tarpaulin tents placed in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Although some groups are slowly beginning to provide assistance, there have been criticisms that foreign aid workers with extensive experience are being prevented from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesian law, the reception of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't been done yet.
“Officially, we are still dealing with a regional catastrophe,” said a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government thinks there’s a national disaster, we can start accepting international aid, but that hasn’t happened yet.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days in the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paratroopers at the Asian Games that ended this month in Indonesia.
According to Petra Mandaga, the other people imprisoned at the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I’m struggling with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono recounted how within hours of the paraglider community’s announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to athletes attending a beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one grey hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“It seems to me that this means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Robbers Steal $26,750 While Refilling Cash at ATM at Newport on the Levee
According to a statement from Newport Police Command, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who replenished cash at an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning.
“The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man “ran from the back to a Brink employee” and stole a bag of money to an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information on the identity of the thieves are asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote of himself, “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before the visit to Saturday Night Live. It is expected that during the performance the artist will present his new album called Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, gave up participation "for emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible, it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter nicknamed Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means one person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confusing qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known by his nicknames Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
Jay-Z, a former West collaborator, also wrote his alias in various ways, with a junction, without a junction, and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square towards a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial assistance to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal groups.
U.S. should double funding for AI research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The remarks are related to announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, even though the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“To begin with, we need to double the budget for AI research: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview this week, CNBC also said that doubling funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures. The company has invested in one of the most significant companies in the world.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that beat the then-best American player in the Othello game. He then held a managerial position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee recognized the success of previous technological initiatives of the US government, such as the competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for the most interesting projects of robots. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the fight, because according to him it will help to find future visionaries.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work very hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that takes away the best academics from us, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States develop AI.
“I believe that people with artificial intelligence who have obtained a doctorate degree should automatically be given a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the US National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations that grant funds to American scientists. However, the quality of academic activity in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from the world of industry and science, and the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence).
Earlier this month, the DARPA agency also announced a $2 billion allocation for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion a year in AI research.
At the same time, the US initiative aimed at creating a national commission for the safety of artificial intelligence has not moved a step forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a move that would have allowed them to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which is blocking the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, in which the historical land of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign encouraging the boycott raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the minimum level of 50% required to declare the referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: "Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of joining Macedonia – one of the countries that emerged after the fall of Yugoslavia – to such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted for the future of my country so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. EU membership will provide us with greater security,” said 79-year-old Olivira Georgievska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of parliamentarians.
The state election commission said no unusual events had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this hour was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of eligible voters cast their votes.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On 30 September 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents spread out by those boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with the head held up, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China or Russia and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in a referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Public Research Institute, between 30 and 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote in Sunday's referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
For a vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
Failure in the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats Brighton's entire defense to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home the defense of Brighton in Saturday's match ended with the result 2: 0 for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester (England).
The goal scored by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with a pitch to the Argentine attacker.
The player overtook three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four players of Brighton.
First he beat one of them, and then he overtook the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton's criminal field.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, which defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero is struggling with a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at that time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues their first lead in a Premier League duel.
The gate in question fell in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in half of Brighton.
He sent a great pass along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few moves, allowing Sterling to move to a distant post.
Manchester City striker pointed the ball into the net just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to ruin Rockies' chances of winning
After losing his chance to play in the playoffs to the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to play in the first lineup.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, if only the Rockies retain their chances of playing in the playoffs. Currently, the team has one more victory than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win Friday’s match against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division title.
“Although we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll go out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the performance of the opponents will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting pitcher for the Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to put Scherzer in the first lineup.
It would be Scherzer’s thirty-fourth appearance in the first line-up. The player took part in Thursday’s kick-off training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
The right-handed pitcher of the team from Washington scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated batters 300 times and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
Trump's meeting in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court Justice, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term presidential election.
“In November, we are putting all the achievements so far on the scale.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I am not starting, I remain very active. I constantly defend our great candidates,” he said.
He went on: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to seize power by all means possible. They are mean and malicious.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal, but we won't give it back to them."
As he said, the Democrats are pursuing a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“It has been very well seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, malicious, unpleasant, and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing U.S. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, which was met with a loud roar from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for the leak?
"Uh, I'm listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of people who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour MPs who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand stemmed from a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences were about the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In the announcement of Friday’s meeting of Labour MPs from Nottingham East district, it was read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
During my eight years as Labour MP, most of the afternoon meetings of the General Committee on Fridays looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now held differently, and the promise of a “heartier and milder” policy has long been forgotten, as far as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is evaluated in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took office as President, and my colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have agreed with before, such as national security or the EU single market.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for the nomination to be withdrawn, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment every day, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is moving to the agenda with insulting others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “votum of mistrust” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly told not to lean back and keep silent on certain issues, and then everything would be “okay”.
That’s not why I took up politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of Margaret Thatcher’s government’s negligence that led to the disintegration of my school class, I have been trying to ensure a better quality of public service for those in need – both as a local councilor and as a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday's proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the willingness to waste my time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of the impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message I send not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be of service to you. I promise that no threat of revocation or imminent political objectives will discourage me from acting in accordance with my convictions and in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr again up
Two late fixtures could somehow distort the final result. However, there is no doubt that the Ayr team deserved to win this extremely interesting match of the Scottish Extraliga.
The team came first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his wards.
“The matches so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still invincible, so I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “We have to respect the Ayr players and they have taken better chances than us.”
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute after Grant Anderson's pitch and Frazier Clim's raise. However, a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to level the score when Jason Baggot caught the ball after an underused chance.
Climo increased the lead of the Ayr after kicking from a penalty kick just before the end of the first half. First he won the pitch, and later he took advantage of the opportunity to raise, achieving a score of 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started well in the second half, with Patrick Anderson upgrading by Baggot reducing the loss to five points.
The game was then suspended for a longer period due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the field on a stretcher. After resuming Ayr increased the lead after Stafford McDowall was applied and Clim was raised.
Then Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card, and Melrose reused her numbers: an untapped attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clim without a ball. MacPherson won a lap on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took the opportunity to raise. He then again managed to raise the score just after the resumption of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught a shot from the penalty shootout and allowed wingman Gregor Henry to score a fifth lap for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game begins a career in the catering industry
Ford Kieran, star of the series Still Game, seems to be starting business in the catering industry. Recently, it was discovered that he became the director of the company managing restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular sitcom BBC. He performs and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning a future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though an informant, Scottish Sun, suggested that Kiernan was trying to get involved in the “emerging gastronomy industry” in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the vicinity of the naval base in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying from public buildings.
In the ports of the navy, from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto reads: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to take him back.”
In a landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict is still alive, like a dream of sailing the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades. Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be delivered on 1 October after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. The people are unanimous, optimistic and hope for a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice together, hoping that the Hague-based organization will recognize Bolivia's claim and that after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to negotiate to give the state independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also hopes for Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts say that the chances of a positive decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia Chilean territory, and it has also stated that it will not affect the arrangements for possible talks.
As Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, Chilean specialist in international law, said, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the final arguments have been presented. Such a short time shows that the case "was not complicated".
Unfortunately for Bolivia, the last four years may have pushed the country away from its goal.
“The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration,” Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ relentless rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
There has been no exchange of ambassadors between the two countries since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the former President and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the opinion that the court’s decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a 139-year period of disputes with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the topic of access to the sea as part of the political game.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The ruling is a great opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korean leaders say nuclear disarmament will not happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the “frozen” is that the US’s failure to lift sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean war has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete disarmament steps.
Both Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want to meet again.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously taking the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of guaranteeing security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of great headgear in clothing stores.
If you want to expand your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized headgear as part of their 2019 summer collection, which dazzled with style during the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats were on Instagram this summer. These designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
Valentino’s distinctive work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery roundabout flooding the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons decorated with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple —but they were not designed to heat the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter's style rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break up with great fashion, you're in luck.
Observers of styles predict that huge hats can get into clothing stores.
The dimensional hats follow “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a 61 cm wide roundabout that everyone has already worn – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which was spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag almost as big as a model wearing it in a swimsuit.
The burnt orange raffia bag, finished with raffia fringes and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the collection of Jacquesus La Riviera for the summer season 2019 during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in stores next summer — because the designer has managed to exert so much influence, it would be hard not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Necessary for World Citizens
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast of further excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social ventures.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), the schools with more than 30,000 students across Scotland aim to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and to indicate their role as global citizens.
As an educational sector with the ability to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages occupy the first place in the league rankings, with the highest susceptibility rates in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A score in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an A score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the teaching of languages as subjects of choice is conducted in the same scope as the teaching of STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the framework of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 study by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of job vacancies were due to a lack of candidates’ language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people to start a career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with an increasing number of jobs requiring language skills.
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future, regardless of the career path you choose.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person compared to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit, 15%, percentage.
That is why investing in foreign language teaching is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of the child, in independent schools there will always be many languages to choose from, which will be taught by the specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed – no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages are still crucial for the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a great choice, diversity and level.
That's just the way it should be.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans wanting to see the debut of LeBron James in the Los Angeles Lakers have finally arrived.
Luke Walton, the Lakers coach, announced that LeBron James will play in the pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James was likely to play incomplete minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers pre-season matches.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to be in pre-season matches to prepare,” he said.
Trump election rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is kicking off a series of election rallies this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned election rallies to be held next week, along with stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming his suspension of his vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump’s election rally take place in West Virginia tonight, and where will it be available to watch online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m., on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s election event in West Virginia will be followed live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere over allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated Senate vote to suspend the election for a maximum of one week, for the time of the FBI’s investigation.
The main goal of this series of election rallies, however, is to support Republicans facing difficult November elections.
So President Trump’s campaign with five rallies next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to assist Republicans in protecting and expanding the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point in the president’s schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” said Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to give his name.
Today’s election event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the last month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who loses in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Maintaining Hope for Victory in Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format on Saturday afternoon could be what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, and most of all in such competitions as these.
So what does their momentum look like at the moment?
“They were six points ahead, and now they’re only four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum,” said Jordan Spieth.
Europe, of course, leads with four points, while there are still twelve points to be scored.
The Americans, Spieth says, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy models to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each of them could boast of scoring three out of four points.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Whole-throat screams, a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, sinking the key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, was met with a similar cry — one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
Eighteen holes to victory.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and was not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that did not score a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal a potential European team victory at Le Golf National.
It would be better if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a fourball morning hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the double front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede into a hole they would never get out of.
On Sunday, there is no one to help you get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a change of strategy can happen in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant advantage on the last day, but the foursome session has also shown that the US team has a passion for the fight, which some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with the result of 10-6 Saturday matches of fourball and foursome with the United States.
The inspired duo — Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari — took the lead, scoring two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the non-target American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two matches, but could not make up for the losses.
To retain the trophy, Jim Furyk's team must score eight points out of 12 singles to be played on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while together with Mollinari (the band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in four opening matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fourball format in a great style, they beat the pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 score.
Woods, who has struggled through two Saturday matches, occasionally showed a flash of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 matches in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not participate in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were ranked 1 and 3 respectively.
The European team, however, did not have everything in mind on this pleasant, cool day in a field southwest of Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a landslide 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball format and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team make a four-point loss by starting a single, although Furyk's team would only need a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says “definitely not” to unilateral disarmament without trust.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday at the United Nations that the failure to lift sanctions only deepens North Korea's lack of trust in the United States and there is no way the country will unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the site of nuclear tests, and committing to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"We do not see any specific response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to unilaterally disarm North Korea.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known grievances about Washington’s reluctance to take a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking action gradually, his statement seemed significant because it did not reject unilateral denuclearization, as it has in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. President and North Korean leader, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised security guarantees for Korea.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (from 1950 to 1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a forced manner, even opposing the signing of a 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
“The belief that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a mockery of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the failure to lift sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If South Korea were the party to the denuclearization issue, and not the United States, then there would be no such impasse in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”
Meanwhile, Ri’s tone of speech was completely different from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles in the United States was inevitable after Trump’s “Mr. Evil President” called Kim Jong Un a “rocket man.”
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and said that until North Korea is stripped of its nuclear weapons, sanctions will not be lifted.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a timeframe for this, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be ongoing until we have found complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly forum and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit is not a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours North Korea condemned him for “placing gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in to dismantle a missile test site and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that the “appropriate measures” he cared about were the security guarantees Trump had pledged in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on long-term rest.
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, aimed at combating the growing macho culture of being taught by “all-night caffeine-driven students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by a speech about the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only being told this now that I’m in my final year of college?’
She stated that no one had ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
During the course, which was held for the first time this year, it is explained to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in learning and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said the course was set to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to keep your sleep regular.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not lead to an immediate change in students’ behaviour.
But we believe that they have a right to know — just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking.”
A culture of pride in “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Ensuring enough good quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after taking one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of the course for the entire campus.
According to him, the next step is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar program of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic devices screens and LED lighting, which can upset the circadian rhythm and lead to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during a fight on the outing in Livingston, when Dolly Menga with his shot led to the defeat of the dismantled team of Steven Gerrard, achieving a score of 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to record their first win since their 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, making his team eight points away from Ladbrokes Premiership leader Hearts.
Menga scored a goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' lack of commitment didn't seem to improve.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place – just behind Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers may be in further trouble due to the need to treat the head wound of linear referee Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stands.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same eleven Livingston, who took a point to the Hearts team last week, being delighted with the way his well-trained team tormented his opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but it was the Livingston team that did more with the ball once they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder did not take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed a deep free kick to Captain Craig Halkett, but his fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only stay in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he deserved a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless ran into each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers managed to give only two clear shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was barely concerned about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s 34-minute opening goal may have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort they put in to win it.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with the deep, permanent piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who kept calm by giving Menga a simple finish to the action.
Gerrard was not in vain at the break, and exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent—a change that almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball at Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to lock it from his position.
The Livingston team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long passes one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor was well placed before Jacobs, after which Lithgow pushed the game from the corner.
Rangers reserve, Glenn Middleton, had once again hoped for a penalty kick when he got tangled up with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning edition of Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become both a part of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy-scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to locate radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells as part of treatment.
This method consists in separating the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are re-injected into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize hostile cells experienced the disappearance of ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method consists in separating the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” the protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the patient with these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine is very promising.”
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells has worked to treat some type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA cap on her head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was “bulged” in the studio during the Saturday Night Live program after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing that night his third song titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great”, he held a deposition against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist!’
If I cared about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault allegations brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to make fun of West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've got a hold of me!
And then they say I have no choice,” said the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "You say I have no choice?" and added, "I'm going to put on a superman cape so you can't tell me what to do.
Let's accept."
His words twice caused the audience to “beep” and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed, reports Variety. The person in the studio during these events: “There was a grave silence in the studio.”
West was invited to the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of the song I Love it in the disguise of a Perrier water bottle.
West received support from TPUSA’s conservative group boss, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR PLAYING THE MAFIA.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West “was just himself and it’s absolutely great.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Befriended rapper Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion, and music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder in Belfast restaurant stabbed with knife
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast City Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen causes young boys to often think that they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he felt “quite confident” about the matter.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, looking from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It is clear that not all is well with young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play in any of the prequels or sequels of Game of Thrones after the series ended the following year, saying that he had "finished the battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's "True West," a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers meeting his wife Rose the best thing that happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“On the set, I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte — the object of love interest of the character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to health workers in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV has been almost completely reduced, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Considering the conservative values of the country, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members has leaked data from Republican senators — “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
A member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, on Saturday rejected allegations that a member of her team had posted personal data of three Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the charges were brought by experts and websites linked to “ultra-right wings.”
“Lies, lies and even more vile lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person on the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after Kavanaugh's candidacy was challenged by three senators.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and published information about a member of the Waters team, Hill said.
“This groundless allegation is completely false and it’s a one hundred percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak.
This unfounded accusation is completely false, and it is a one hundred percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly drew criticism on the internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This way of denying is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they can’t be wrong.
He can't provoke.
He cannot question the motives of the person making the accusations.
For that, he must remain calm.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of displaying excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if that’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and held legally responsible for all their actions that pose a threat to any of my team members,” she said.
Johnny English: Knockout – a spy parody with a weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the action and comedy series “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with the film “Johnny English” and which returned to cinemas in 2011 with the film “Johnny English: Reactive”.
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, perpetually surprised, with a rubbery face, incompetent Johnny English again received a license to knit — his name and surname more than anything else indicates that it is an extensive, comical product intended for non-English-speaking viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid undercover agent who, despite his bizarre tastes for smoothie glamour, has a touch of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasius Beans and a drop of that guy adding one note to the melody of the Chariots of Fire theme at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class mystery man — Atkinson once played in the already forgotten TV commercials of Barclaycard, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English movie, there are one or two notable moments.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was beaten rhythmically by the rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humour seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since today also “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
The humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults – in my opinion, Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as inventive and coherent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Yass Bean.
It has always been assumed that the UK is in serious trouble.
Cyberhacker infiltrates a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the horror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister’s bitter spell, which is a pompous, wasted character already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything in her power, playing the character of Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her the opportunity to expand her wings.
Her advisors from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means incompetent Johnny English himself, currently employed as a teacher at some elegant school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — some good gags while giving lessons on English spying.
English is called to Whitehall for a check-in, reuniting with his former sidekick Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man tied to the submarine commander, a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin partak in the secret service of Her Majesty return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve the UK’s computer problems – the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; bring chaos, sneaking aboard a luxury yacht Volty; and English is wreaking havoc when using a virtual reality kit to get to know the interior of Volty's home.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the pleasant and high-profile performance, the whole film is very similar to children's television.
Typical average.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist thinking: Couldn’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suited his talent?
The Labour Party denies drafting a plan for a four-day work week for British workers to be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan, under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary of five days.
The party reportedly wants corporate executives to hand over to employees the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This allows employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of pay.
Sources say the idea will “enter” into the party’s economic program and plans to meet the country’s workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour Party member told The Sunday Times: “A policy change is expected to be announced before the end of this year.”
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is something that fits the party’s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day week of work during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not the party's policy and its introduction is not considered by the party."
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadows, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “directors without a face” and “speculators” in public utilities.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water company shareholders may not be able to reclaim all of their holdings, as the Labour Party government could make “deductions” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and create integrative equity funds to transfer 10 percent of private-sector equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond on 60 Minutes to the question of whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their mindset
The FBI investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the investigation office’s findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes TV host Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could change their mindset.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“On my way to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when the charge came up, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, decisive and unequivocal.”
Graham's opinion, however, seems to have been forged in stone.
“I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett has resolutely denied it,” Graham said.
“None of the people who reported it could verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival will take place next Saturday in New York City, an annual music event that boasts an incredibly impressive line-up of stars and an equally impressive mission – to eradicate poverty in the world.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of celebrities such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the main goal of this event, which is to eliminate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant activities to help raise awareness about the goal of eradicating poverty.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast of in terms of the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to require action, or another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the campaign since 2011, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also says that these actions have helped spur world leaders to announce commitments and legislation worth more than $37 billion, which is expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or financed.
The group estimates that secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which pledged to donate $35 million to Rwanda to help eradicate malnutrition in the country after members of Global Citizen sent more than 4,700 tweets.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments, and Global Citizen members like you, we can make history of social injustice, such as malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, said during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after implementing more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of maternal and child nutrition, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website was “How do you know you can end extreme poverty?”
Global citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult road —sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the great civil rights movements of the past and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars performing at this year’s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington could “return to its navy if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it is acting at the invitation of a legitimate government — is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy trade, just as it is in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “one-trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration continues a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is to double its existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the implementation of this project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think this is a big problem when a third country is interfering with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s recent meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, and this also applies to women in the top position,” she said.
“After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for president.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has bluntly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who opted for the “probably” option said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken into account in relation to the potential candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during Donald Trump’s campaign rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through when he comes back, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told an audience at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest a “taboo subject,” after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there will be respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and all the other members of the military have given to their country.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, inciting false testimony in a report on domestic violence, and possessing a weapon in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed an amicus curi<0xC3><0xA6> letter in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal sons from the gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries struggling with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “ignores the state, federal and international law that has been in place for decades.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a ban violates this principle,” the letter said.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry hurts the U.S. economy, saying they could become entrepreneurs and “become the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on a racial, religious, national or social basis or because of belonging to a particular social group or who have such and other political beliefs,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems —even the serious ones— that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting her fevered son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the wounded, including Two Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and arm, were resting outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he spoke of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of a hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was pushed into the rubble of the wall,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The US ambassador accuses China of “harassing” propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid China Daily supplement in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections — China has denied the accusation.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters this was a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are currently escalating a trade war that has led to tariffs on mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “now begins to harass with double force by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the respected American tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“There will be no voices of opposition in the kiosk on the street in Beijing and no true reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about the disturbing economic direction China is taking, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans lash out at women in midterm elections over Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that your members will meet in the upcoming midterm elections with a violent reaction, especially from women.
The emotions surrounding this event are extremely high, and the majority of Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be undone,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he had doubts about whether Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) last-minute FBI investigation efforts were enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it until November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate lobby over Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission’s decision not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and that’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among indecisive suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they dislike the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could come up with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a lot of mess,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans coped with the situation and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided about who to trust in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having a little more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimonies, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimonies.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet in order to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is an open-source platform company — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“The historic moment has arrived.”
The app uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “personal data online store” or POD.
It can include contact lists, do-it-yourself lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of the online store with personal data is that it is completely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide resources, processes and the right skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all their business models upside down from day to day.
“I don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Wednesday post on Medium that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been much involved in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Order of the Victoria Cross in World War I
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann was honoured on 29 September 1918 for his assault on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said the stone’s unveiling on the centenary of his grandfather’s award was “extraordinarily symbolic.”
On September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns".
Then he hastened to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led her forward, after which alone he launched an attack on the position of the field units, neutralizing three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never handle, but at the same time something humble.”
Together with his brother, Dr. James Vann, he laid the wreath after the end of the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206, instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you haven’t slept all night to watch the emotionally packed Bellator 206 gala and finally not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change of program to Peppa Pig.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning specifically to see this fight.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change to a cartoon for children as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to a government regulation, this type of content is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., requiring a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig, yes."
Bellator’s chairman, Scott Coker, said they would finalize a schedule to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I think about repeating the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is six o’clock in the morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were overwhelmed by a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical fault.
But it wasn't a fault, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much and unfortunately we overcame it.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels ‘worse’ for sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, Lauren Laverne said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The usual host of this many-year-old program, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
He said, “To this day, this feeling of less value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove he was “worth something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and thus wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "surprised" him.
Daley married Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he said, referring to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “it’s hard for him to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that completely changed his perception of certain things.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked about was whether they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud by Heather Small — which accompanied him in preparation for the Olympics and which still gives him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Demonstrating Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he will have to work on his form to keep his mark.
Mickelson, who plays for the twelfth time in a biennial event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often did for the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day cheering the team and working to improve his game in the hopes of fixing the cause of his being sent back to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who has never given the simplest shots, even at the peak of his career, is not doing very well on the narrow field of Le Golf National, where erroneous shots are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with a frenzy, the match of Mickelson can be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he could hardly do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, tapped me on the back, held me in his arms and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He’s in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to his bands both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it went, and that's what we had to do.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which was never equal to his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws on his account. Furyk said that his presence contributed a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, funny, and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
It’s a lot more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at the Valderrama field, where he, along with Vice-Captain Seven Ballesteros, had a five-point lead over the Americans, but missed the finish line by the shortest hair possible, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“It’s not to be forgotten that we had a big advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the Valderrama field we only won by a hair,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 both on Friday and yesterday, which gave Le-6 the lead.
Time will show me and all the team members that this is not the end.
You're doing your best tomorrow.
Go out there and do everything right.
The end will be only when points appear on the board.
We have a goal to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I said from the beginning that I focused on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
The singles start tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when things are going well, but when you’re playing alone, your golf skills are tested to the limit.
This is a message that you have to give to the players, to give everything tomorrow.
Your partner has to do their best.”
Jim Furyk, in contrast to Bjorn, will expect his players to score better alone than when playing with their partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced major turnarounds last day, being a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he was defeated after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah field".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, warmed up his players to fight on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important matches — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, as was the case in the fields of Brookline and Medinah.
If this momentum goes one way, it will put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set our line-up accordingly and set the boys up in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow.”
Thomas was entrusted with the task of leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other players of the European team in the top half of the program.
“I’ve decided on this group of guys in that order because I think they’ll be able to handle it throughout the game,” Bjorn said of his singles choices.
New German warship delayed again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not happen until at least next year due to faulty arrangements and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new frigate class Baden-Wuerttemberg, was moved to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but due to problems that appeared after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among others, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – it should be possible to operate new frigates up to two years away from home ports.
“Continuous delays mean that these modern warships, which are supposed to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will become obsolete at the time of service,” Die Zeit said.
The unfortunate frigate F125 appeared on the front pages of the newspapers last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported on a number of key "software and hardware defects" that rendered the ship useless in a combat mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half as much as the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernization.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice the weight of a similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective equipment, the cost of the entire project — including training the crew — also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the commissioning of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navies “run out of ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem has increased over time due to the decommissioning of the old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates could be included in the navy.
National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
A new study on the Highlands estate in Scotland aims to show how bats use the landscape to get food.
The findings are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future conservation efforts.
The study, led by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland, will look at common and small dwarfs, as well as brown bats with long ears and bats from the Red Nights family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special recorders will be deployed to track bat activity throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by bats and the behavior of individual species.
Then, a habitat map and report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work, which have an impact on ridges and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as well as fly glue and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to night hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out tests, inspections of the bays, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the landlord, says it's an ideal territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to bats, and the work we do here and in other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling for bats before proceeding with maintenance work on the estates, as the unintentional destruction of one rod can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected — killing, harassing, or disturbing them, as well as destroying their perimeter is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While His Lawyers Plan to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as “fake news”, saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese striker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, a footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were announced, described the news as “fake news” in a live Instagram feed addressed to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s news is fake news,” said the five-time winner of the ball.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” he added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they have called “inadmissible reporting of privacy concerns,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said he would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to a soccer player’s room where he allegedly raped a woman anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he is “99 percent a good guy” who was seduced by that “one percent.”
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she wants to nullify the settlement now because she still cannot forget about the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was moving from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: UK ‘would always regret’ the departure of car manufacturers
The UK would “regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after leaving the European Union, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "disturbed" when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby, would be temporarily suspended.
“We need an agreement,” Clark said.
A representative of the Japanese carmaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces the Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without a deal, then production at our factory will be stopped,” said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern, according to car manufacturers, are the risks associated with the supply chain if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be obstacles at the border, which industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be halted.
Clark said the plan with Chequers Theresa May for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid border controls.”
"We need an agreement. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the right use of this situation," he said in today's BBC Radio 4 program.
“Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers’ statements demonstrate that we need to be able to continue what constituted a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota had not been able to say for how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the Unite Board of Trade Unions, said the union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” due to the ongoing fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the potential impediment to the president’s judicial activities.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wiretap to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the reports.
On Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. The meeting was postponed to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, during which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date for this meeting has not yet been set, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll tell the press.”
Several journalists have questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked about the reason for this.
Sanders said the small number of press conferences was not caused by a reluctance to “ostentative” television journalists, after which she added: “I will not hide that they are “ostentative”.
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president is conducting more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We have read the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States of America questions, this is a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do it regularly, and we have done it very often over the past few weeks, and press conferences will give way to sessions where you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, behaving too loosely and sometimes bizarrely in front of assembled journalists.
Health Minister writes to EU workers employed by NHS Scotland in the face of Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from EU countries employed in the Scottish health service to convey their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of processing applications for "settled status" for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “Negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union continued this summer. Appropriate decisions will be taken this autumn.
The British government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery after suffering a head injury
The Tennessee State Tigers' top scorer, Christion Abercrombie, underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's Vanderbilt Commodores match, which ended with the Tennessee team's 31-27 defeat, Mike Organ reported.
Rod Reed, the head coach of the Tennessee State team, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the side line, then he fell to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then placed it on a stretcher and carried it out for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville (Tennessee) that Abercrombie had been operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury" and the Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (second-year student dismissed from representing the university for a year to train his skills) plays his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the match, he had five runs, which gives him 18 runs throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax fee when buying property in the UK
According to the new tory plans, buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will include people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying real estate in the UK will be charged a higher tax fee, and the resulting additional funds will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to offset Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden on more earners.
Higher tax charges will apply to individuals and non-tax-paying businesses in the UK. Additional funds are to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee – charged in addition to the current tax charge, including higher rates for second houses and apartments purchased for rent two years ago – can be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Since many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions —especially the capital— have become “ghost cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson’s call for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major developers of maintaining high property prices by occupying the land but not using it, and also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the "residential scandal" in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and an end to evictions “for no reason.”
It also wants to give local governments greater authority to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I would be committed to rebuilding Britain’s dream of making each generation’s life better than the previous one.
It also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here as easily as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, but the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street remains far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest ambition is to be Scotland’s selector”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's head coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot is working hard to rehabilitate North-East, which is currently in third place in League One with a three-point loss to the top team.
He moved to Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get into the B team,” Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“As a child, I watched a lot of Scottish matches with my father in Hampden and I was always attracted to it.
But that will only happen if I succeed as a coach.”
Ross' predecessors as coach of Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former coach Aloa Athletic says he doesn’t feel intimidated by taking on the role of such prominent figures in such a big club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, there is undoubtedly a place for it,” he adds.
“It’s not going to be easy, but I’ll probably feel like I’ve been successful here, only if I succeed.”
Ross' coaching career has only lasted for three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach in Dumbarton and for 15 months he was a member of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Aloa re-emerge after degrading to the third league, and in the following season led St Mirren from the edge of the decline to the championship.
Jack Ross says he feels much more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” Aloa recalls taking over as coach.
“I really believed that running a team is much better for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because as a player I was doing well, I made good money and I achieved some measurable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the coach’s work, but I feel good in this role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and I’m doing it now, and I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life.”

Research shows that the best time to drink beer is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave caused a rapid influx of customers to British pubs, but it was reflected by hiccups in restaurant chains.
The study found that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of CGA, the consulting firm that developed the data, said: “Continuous heat and longer than anticipated participation of England in the World Cup caused the results from July to form similar to June, when the turnover in pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the difference that the restaurant’s earnings fell even more.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant sales in June further increased in July.
The pubs and bars offering drinks did their best – their sales growth exceeded the decline recorded in restaurants.
The food-serving pubs also suffered during the heat, though not as much as the restaurant owners.
Looks like people were just thirsty.
Drink sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, and food sales fell three percent.”
Paul Newman, from RSM’s entertainment and tourism analysis firm, said: “These results are consistent with the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors influencing the amount of consumption 'outside the home' are the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dire consequences, given the ongoing pressure to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable time for the owners of the food-serving establishments and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed an increase in the number of fake Insta sites.
The news has heightened fears that they contain sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children —some as young as 11— set up social media accounts that they don’t disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has heightened concerns that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of students admitted to having a polite “main” account that they show to their parents and also have private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, met a teenage girl who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted at independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to maintaining private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are creating their places on the internet where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” on the board of Scottish Athletics
During the annual general meeting of the management of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as a non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed track and field athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that putting her on the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am very happy to be able to give the Council the voice of the athletes, and I hope that I can really help to manage the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that time will tell if I will regain my fitness and to what extent.
It was an agonizing job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again, and I went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!”
A lactating ad that compares mothers to cows sparks extreme emotions on the Internet
The lactating company caused a storm on the Internet, publishing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to milked cows.
To announce the launch of “the world’s first silent underwear lactator,” its manufacturer, Elvie, has published a mocking commercial in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it gives mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a haystack to the song, in which you can hear the words: "Yes, I do, but you can't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not just my tits."
And the refrain goes like this: “Pump them out, pump them out, I will feed them to the children, pump them out, pump them out, I will milk my ladies.”
The advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has caused much controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, to give milk, they need to become pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their babies being taken away from them a few days after birth,” one user wrote.

Another person commented: “Of course, this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise lactators for mothers who can keep their babies.”
Someone else added: “This advertisement is completely detached from reality.”
Others are defending the clip — one of the women said that she thinks the song is “fun”.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I would buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a little crazy, but I don't find a second bottom in it.
It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pull away their food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators attached discreetly to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many nursing women feel like cows.
However, the Elvie lactator is completely quiet, there are no cables or tubes, and it can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their children on their hands, and even leave the house while pulling food away.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
By bringing together nursing women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges of weaning, while presenting in a fun and coherent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This isn't the first time that lactator Elvie has hit the headlines.
During the London Fashion Week during the show of Marta Jakubowski, a mother of two children with this product appeared on the runway.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Secretly Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of immigrant children detained is rapidly increasing, although the number of people crossing the border every month is not really changing. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to place children in sponsorship.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who fear being exposed to deportation if they report for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults residing on the joint farm, which would then be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who volunteered to sponsor unaccompanied children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously recorded.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in the same household are illegally staying in the country, and a large part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case by previous standards.
A lot will be put up via videoconferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be deported immediately.
According to shelter staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier it is for them to become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbursts of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders said the problems were even more serious in larger centers like Tornillo, where its size makes it easier to overlook signals that something is wrong with the baby.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them adequate time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupational forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moual also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being waged for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were staying on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terrorism is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been forced out of their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight its holy battle until the cleansing of Syrian territory” from both terrorist groups and “all foreigners residing there illegally.”
There are currently about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting an irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
Diplomats from the UN say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last large rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had a “clear time frame” and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Front for the Defense of the Levant’s Population, who would be “eliminated”.
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee of members of the ruling party and the opposition to draw up a draft of Syria’s post-war constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “verifying the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency ends early with his removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final so far.”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-team ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, while MSNBC’s has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, Fox News attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers during its peak hours, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC’s “Rachel Maddow Show” has reached the highest scores among cable television, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers of evening news programs.
“People fly like moths to the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, chief producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She recalls driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else on television, determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of reunification of immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just about being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (‘trade-overloaded clothing’, as described by The Washington Post and The Trump Post) for six hours.
I’ll never look at Super Mario the way I used to.
“What he’s doing is in part reminiscent of a reality show in that it delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast and day-to-day spins of the Trump show (like attacking NFL players or praising Kim Jong Un).
You can't afford to miss the episode, because you're gonna be in arrears.
When I met Mike Fleiss this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai Island, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t get away with it, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Commission and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing all these crazy programs before and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

The influx of money from outside for the congressional election campaign
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the constituencies, as a result of which the race for one position will now become two current congressmen, a river of cash flows to the 17th constituency in Pennsylvania.
This recently formed suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented in Congress by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during last spring’s special election.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, now representing the former District 12 of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new District 17.
The district maps were corrected after the January Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled that the old districts were designated unfairly, giving Republicans an advantage and being inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new district of 17 began with a fight to fund a campaign between the party’s main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning the widely-reported election to the 18th constituency in March.
A Republican has held this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from the idea
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite Washington’s slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela, and until the expulsion of the partners of the management team of the Trump Organization, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” the department’s spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
The sanctions, however, were intended to be imposed only on El Salvador, which, according to estimates, in 2017 received from the United States $140 million in aid, among other things, to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and visas for certain people, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to address the conclusions of a similar assembly last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
In mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus eliminating any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence is due to speak at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, as a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the meeting.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their relationship was confirmed by an external analyst from the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as evidence is now available to the public.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation also examines whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable as he prepares to speak to voters again, and may even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that the downfall of Trump — or of people in his equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long it will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points in front of the Americans.
What do we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he offered a covert recording of the president and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly commissioned FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we elect the people who will hold Donald Trump accountable to Congress in the middle of the presidential term?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the sabbath candles on that swastika-marked table.
With such a legacy, how could I not look to the future optimistically?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans looks forward to the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory with the Austrians, obtained after an impressive draw with Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Group G of the Europa League.
Up until the 2:2 draw with Villareal, the knee injury prevented sidekick Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes the result will work for the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
“It did us good because Villarreal is in good shape,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something — and we scored a point.
Maybe in the end we could still push them, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to score three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent scored a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and this and we will win a positive result.
The past year has been definitely tough due to everything related to my injury and changes to the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great and the boys really like to play. The training is going well.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings spends women sleep with eyelids
Although the survey participants knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few spoke to their family about it.
In a study conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t want to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance company.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare a family to take care of yourself if you do not express your will in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask your financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: You will prevent court battles with this.
Appoint a trusted health care attorney who will oversee and ensure that the right people do what you want them to do if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It is worth having such a plan on hand.”
Man shot repeatedly by windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot from a windmill as he returned home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as an “accidental action”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries do not endanger the life of the man. The police ask for witnesses to report the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday.
Due to the broken communication, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupaten, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
After the Palu disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala kabupatena on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. It is estimated that in 2017 they were inhabited by 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its establishment.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit with a level lower than the province) stretching along the northwest coast of the island over a length of more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fishing and agriculture, which developed especially in the coastal Donggala kabupatena.
Another source of income of the province are nickel mines, but they are located mainly in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Palu and Donggala several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami that hit Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami in western Donggala killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire, causing earthquakes to occur there quite regularly.
The largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, the west coast of Sumatra was hit by a series of powerful earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was a 7.6-magnitude earthquake.
As a result, more than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami wave as high as 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya kabupaten in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the destruction brought by the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence, obstructing reporting and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report a crime, he took her phone.
KTUU reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's custody and has a $500 bail.
According to her information, last Saturday he appeared in court, where in his defense speech he stated that he was “definitely innocent”.
There are three class A offences in Palin, which means that he can receive a sentence of up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with Class B offences, which are punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting and possession of a weapon in an intoxicated state in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sara Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he had acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia tsunami after earthquake
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand the death penalty for the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors from New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bicycle path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, the 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck, which he drove pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notice filed in the southern district of New York that it intends to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious injuries to the body.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in connection with illegal activity — a procedure typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases — and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection." The way Saipov conducted it, they described as "monstrous, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has brought injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucza."
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were in New York for tourism.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of a federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 at Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the months after the attack.
Police say he told investigators he was fine with what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room.
To the 22 counts of indictment, he replies that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal officials representing Saipov, said they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and the rejection of life without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought on all those concerned,” he said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel hot” beating from eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s lawmakers suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage were Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union.”
However, the addition of the tories opting to remain in the community to a separate protest against Brexit, which took place in the city, further highlighted the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks, which faces Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her plan of compromise with Chequers amidst attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies say that despite the opposition, it will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its proposal and “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of Chequers.”
He suggested that the proxy should be Nigel Farage, to whom responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels should be transferred.
“If he was doing it, we would be out of the Union now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Speaking about his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to have our own rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely false.”
And then there was Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns of the Tory Party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party or our activists, who are crowding the streets and who have elected us, do not support it either.
Please drop the plan with Chequers and start listening.”
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “The prime ministers maintain their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians involved in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they are to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people, and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
At the time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved banners “Torysi vs. Brexit” after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, mocked the Conservatives for security issues with the party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize the IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada plus plus plan, the smooth border, the free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, with her opponent being Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now being said that in the 2020 election, Warren could beat Trump.
Saturday’s Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall formula since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government —and she also means the woman at the top.”
Arrest of the killer of the deadly shooting in which the player of the LSU team, Wayde Sims, was killed
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in Friday’s shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11 a.m.
A video of the shooting was released on Friday asking for help identifying the man.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a gun and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the crime scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken to the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Measuring 1.98 m, Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches, with 10 starts in the last season, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team's command allowed him to win against Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that the Mercedes team’s command would have a big impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to drive in the tail of the peloton, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes rider went to the pit in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after a double move of the rival aimed at defending his position on the third corner, Hamil went out.
Max Verstappen took off from the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he came in seventh place.
He then drove for a large part of the race because he did not change his tyres to finish fast and take the fourth position from Kimi Raikkonen.
In the end, he went to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he was not able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diana Feinstein, who claimed she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony made by Christina Ford before the Senate Judiciary Commission. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people are “sincere, malicious and lying.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate that we have been witnessing for several days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
You remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal this?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the content of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal it to her."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal ... No, we didn’t reveal,” he added, squeezing the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and its contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to be discreet and, at her request, I did not disclose this content.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on them during the meeting on Saturday: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen in my life.”
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom the three women accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power by all means.
You can see meanness, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
The Dundee Stars have acquitted their loss in the Elite League on Friday with the Belfast Giants, winning a 5–3 rematch at home on Saturday.
The giants quickly gained a two-door lead after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard scored again for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss of the Elite League season for Adam Keefe's wards, who, despite an initial loss on Friday night, won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
The two teams met for the fourth time this season, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaull's assist. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10 a.m., Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt leveled the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, when at the end of the first third he scored his second goal that evening.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard matched the score again with a goal scored during the 27:37 game.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen provide Dundee with the first advantage in this match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who have lost four in their last five games, will play the next match at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on a plane escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been hailed as a hero after being killed, helping to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Severe aftershocks continue to be felt in the area, and many people have been trapped in rubble in the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the swinging air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight number 6321), which was on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when he thought he was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the controller’s decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthony left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This message has torn our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The National Disaster Management Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death continues to grow because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached,” said Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Sutopo.
A six-meter wave of tsunami destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing in bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
“Small shops are being robbed.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we will find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and addressed the army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
This year Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Micronesia: Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed on a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, reported that one person was missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said that according to the data on Saturday afternoon could not be counted one man who was traveling on a non-ferrous plane.
They said they were working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane hit the water while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said there were six more passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is not clear what caused the crash, nor is its exact course known.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the water reaching to the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the cabin crew panicked and shouted, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the rescue operation was also aided by seamen who were working nearby to modernize the coastline. Using an inflatable boat, they managed to transport people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have died in the last two decades in plane crashes belonging to an airline registered in Papua New Guinea.
An analyst reconstructed the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors finished presenting evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been testifying for hours as a forensic expert in information analysis.
He described to the judges how, using cell phone records, he recreated the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he obtained location data from various mobile phones, which showed that the fair evening Tellis was with Chambers.
When the data confirmed that while Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors whether Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he replied that “he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis’s claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after his death, Chambers Tellis deleted her contact details, as well as text messages and calls from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that the case will probably be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed — What is Hip-Hop Conscious?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today’s hip-hop has moved away from the original political content and social issues.
Members of the band want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, there has recently been a revival in the UK of artists such as The Fugees and Common.
Another black one?!
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' text message
A New York City nanny sues a couple for dismissing her from a racist job after receiving a misaddressed text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly consternated when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who arbitrarily appeared on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NOT, ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to him, she mistakenly sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized the gaffe had been committed, she fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that the warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was poorly performing her duties, and that she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her working day and then sent home by Uber.
She is now demanding compensation from a couple for an exemption of $350 a day, multiplied by the six months she was originally employed with her residence, even though she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday and added, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies the accusations of racism, arguing that ending their relationship with Ms. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they feared they could not trust her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone you have hurt, even if it was a mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Come on, come on."
Comparing the lawsuit to “blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
Although the case in court has not yet ended, the public quickly issued a couple of sentences on social media, criticizing her for her behavior and way of thinking.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Book Publishers Feared Readers Won't Feel Tied to Talking Bear
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born soon after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who, before the little teddy bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman for the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book's release seems "sweet-bitter".
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he did not boast,” he adds.
However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had achieved something — you feel proud of him, even though it is not your merit.
I think Paddington’s success was seen in this way.
Although he invented it and created it, he always credited Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, he probably wouldn’t make it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, “Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She had died a while before, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit there and wait, knowing that all this was unfolding.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, got on board with the other passengers, unaware of the torments she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt all-embracing sympathy for Nada.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from mourning women to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones have committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where people can get help.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said they could light up every room with it.”
Before he died, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created the cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit still, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother died, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling depressed or sad or anything,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
By Christmas, he was already in a complete hole, and when the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It’s tearing a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance as the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought if we could actually get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could get some kind of unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “falling apart” into opposing camps, leading to a stalemate.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
Congressional elections are already in a few weeks — November 6th. If, as predicted, the Republicans lose them, the chances of choosing a particular person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him at the White House and through him he met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI reports?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will be voted on.
It is not certain that Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South Korea has fallen.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that have affected the situation are more precise checks on the border between North Korea and China and higher rates charged by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees is ultimately South Korean citizenship proposed.
According to authorities in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the tightly-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
North-South relations, which are theoretically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearization, which had previously stalled.
This was after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on the desire to clear the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under these circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to work in the Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysteric” and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke during an interview she gave during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin on Saturday.
"I think if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh made Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh showed intense emotion at times, almost shouting and losing his speech when discussing family issues and his high school years.
He also explicitly rebuked the Democrats on the committee, describing the charges against him as a “grotesque and coordinated reputational attack” orchestrated by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony showed he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because it revealed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would have sought Kavanaugh's dismissal if he had been nominated and if the Democrats had won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she fears Kavanaugh’s possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh shunned questions about whether he would have overturned some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
“This is not the time to bring to justice a hysterical, prejudiced person who expects us to say ‘how wonderful it is,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to own it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of rage, and she can't throw it out without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s quite common, isn’t it?”
She added: “A woman who was the manager of a company helped me a lot. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she came up with a way that when she got nervous and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.
And he's still doing his job.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are acceptable as an outlet for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of the first jobs in a male-dominated office was how one day I started crying out of inexpressible rage. An elderly woman —a cool executive I had always been a little afraid of— grabbed me by the neck and led me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad, and they’re happy that they’ve done it to you.”
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a Colorado congresswoman, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and pulled out of the race, frustrated to the limit, Patricia realized she could actually consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates before the election, and the last thing they needed was another.
Someone has described this situation as 'Queen Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'.
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder was lagging behind in raising funds and promised herself that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to failure.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, had only $250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During the speech, in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so full of emotions — gratitude to those who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sexism — that the voice stuck in her throat.
“You might think I had a nervous breakdown,” he recalls the press.
“You might think I’m being sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
'Weeping?'"
What the economic war between the United States and China can bring to Beijing
The salvos starting the economic war between the U.S. and China have been staggering, and while the battle is still ongoing, in the long run, the conflict between these countries could be beneficial for Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week after the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Each time, Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five percent to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second economy is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to back down means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing your head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to unleash economic chaos in any country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is ‘Ready’ to Return Refugees
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“The situation on our soil is now more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and means of subsistence can voluntarily return to it.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept the aid provided by the conditions or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National field in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has already lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points that were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who for most of the tournament did not go well, hit the ball from the stand directly into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone through all rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was held for the first time in the current format, managed to score 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in Europe, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the top spot in the world ranking, lost two holes before the last hole with the Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom this may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am so happy to get the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m happy to be able to help,” Garcia said after the team’s victory in Europe.
He gives the baton to his compatriot, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a single game on Sunday with the result of 2&1.
“I feel incredibly proud to win with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 scores in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and was second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the treadmill throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American line-up, its captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we squeezed some Europeans.
We've withdrawn.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
Together with PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played much better than us.”
Information about the bloom — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota the density of plankton decreases
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in plankton density in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of variegated inflorescence has been reported in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It stretches over a length of about 209 kilometers of coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
Blooms can be found about 16 kilometers off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The bloom was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations of plankton were recorded in the County of Pinellas, low to medium in the County of Hillsborough, natural to high in the County of Manatee, natural to high in the County of Sarasota, natural to medium in the County of Charlotte, and natural to high in the County of Cololas.
Cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
However, they were not recorded in Northwest Florida last week.
