I was watching Tom.
Have you booked a table?
Where did the money go?
My grandfather was a hero.
I don't like this one.
Use them all.
You were right.
I don't want you to die.
Turn off your cell phone, please.
I'm not rich.
I didn't think you'd understand.
Do you recognize this man?
How about going on a picnic?
We could not buy tickets for the concert until we received money from our friends.
Tom called Mary this morning.
Maybe some other time.
Tom refused to let Mary into the house.
Tom doesn’t play tennis very well.
I am a Palestinian.
I can't do it alone.
You need Tom here.
We've run out of oil.
What do you think they want?
People who live in a place cannot know the pleasure of living in a village.
Mary has beautiful eyes.
She gave me a book for Christmas.
I want a cheeseburger, cola and fries.
She stole the camera.
Welcome to your new home!
There is a problem with my account.
Tom happily agreed.
I think Tom is wrong.
Are you all right?
You may be the only one who can do that.
Who is not right?
Your singing makes professional singers blush from shame.
You know Tom's lying.
I thought you were Tom.
I don't need a knife.
Oh, my God!
Tom's grim.
He was great.
Tom knows it wasn't Mary.
Esther is a Jewish lesbian.
Last week I was bitten by a dog.
You want me to ask him?
Tom and I are not afraid of Mary.
Try to swim!
You are lucky to have such a good job.
What are you holding in your hand?
We're busy.
It's time for dinner.
It is unlikely that Tom will forget how it is done.
Drinking?
Will Tom do it with you?
You're not sleeping?
The meeting began on the fifth day.
Mary said she liked to do it.
What do you want to see while you're here?
Tom knew that Mary was not busy.
I have only been to Tokyo once.
I got the electricity bill.
What color is his sweater?
I bought a new car last week.
I'm sure Tom will be fine.
He cut his finger with a knife.
I didn't know Tom hated Mary that much.
I wonder why Tom planned to do that.
The presence of all members is mandatory.
Don't you feel comfortable?
You underestimated them.
Your parents would be proud of you.
I was born in May.
I agree, too.
I'm lucky.
A small cup of coffee costs two euros.
I wonder if I can do it again.
We have to decide today.
Who do you plan to do this with?
We are satisfied with the decision.
This skirt is cheap.
I saw Tom kissing Mary.
He was standing at the door.
She cried bitterly.
Tom repented of his sins.
You always tell me that.
Is that Mary's husband?
Sam will find out.
A witness who has seen everything with his own eyes is worth more than ten witnesses who have heard everything.
Guess who I am.
Tom went back to the hotel.
How easy is it to learn English?
I play tennis for an hour a day.
Tom is finished.
When I walked into the room, she was playing the piano.
You're very sweet.
Where are your manners?
They have not lost hope.
Tom threw an egg at Mary.
When do you expect to arrive?
Tom wore his shirt.
Tom went to the library.
We need to call the police.
Tom decided to leave early.
Did Tom tell you where the party is?
Mary is tall.
Why are you so surprised?
It's a chair.
Tom didn’t want to wait.
She filled this vase with water.
Tom doesn't hate Mary.
All right, I'll have a bite.
I don't want it anymore.
Do you know what color she likes?
I don't think Tom's gonna be here tonight.
Tom opened a restaurant.
I have to keep trying.
I'm glad you're glad.
I envy your good health.
Yes, with pleasure!
She started playing an old song.
Why do they speak French?
It's a lie.
There are no pyramids in Europe.
It's spring soon.
She speaks two foreign languages.
That's too much.
Tom says I'm very naive.
Why are you telling me this?
Let's go back.
Tom is not crazy.
Don't even think about it.
Tom is very annoying.
Are you afraid?
You ruined my life.
We need to come up with a secret language.
Are you planning to stay for a long time?
When do you plan to go to Japan?
My kids are at school.
I put my suitcase in.
I got out of the car.
Tom has a younger brother named John.
Is there anything you would like to buy?
I'm old.
I'm thinking about you.

Where did all these cars come from?
I live in a giant hole.
Pour salt on the wound.
She refused to speak English.
Tom didn’t know where to look.
We managed to cross the river.
He obviously loves you.
Why is Tom so popular?
Tom is younger than you.
I am a French teacher.
Tom is very open.
I'm hungry because I haven't had lunch.
I'm not blaming anyone.
The plane took off at exactly nine o'clock.
Tom is quite fluent in French.
John caught the tiger and shot two lions.
Don't worry, I'll check it myself.
Tom wiped dry with a towel.
What happened to Tom?
It's a bracelet.
I have a lot of time.
Allow yourself to be happy.
She wants to wait until the wedding.
I'm a little late.
I need the facts.
She could not defend herself.
Next month, Tom is leaving Boston.
Careful, it's still hot.
Let's kiss.
Every year, millions of people die of starvation.
I wanted to know what Tom wanted.
There was a wrong address on the letter.

They have moved on to another religion.
I should be more careful.
I downloaded them.
Mary sold the car.
Thank you for your hospitality.
What is he planning?
You're the best!
Are you ever going to do that?
We were able to save them.
He's a strange person.
I just cut my hair.
Mary said she had never studied French.
I think I’ll buy a new car.
We are to blame.
You're so cute.
It will cost about fifteen dollars.
I knocked on the door.
His theory is worthy of attention.
We're ashamed of Tom.
The help came too late.
This is not a new problem.
The pillow is very uncomfortable.

I tried to contact her.
What does she have?
How's the exam?
Where was this book published?
Tom said he wasn’t tired.
Tom and Mary are doing this.
We need to help Tom.
It was raining all day.
I was saddened by this.
Can I have your phone number?
You should stop.
Tom's going to Boston.
Who said you could do this?
Why did you buy a flower?
The clock is ten minutes behind.
Tom wants to be a doctor.
Speak quietly.
The sun shines during the day and the moon at night.
I stood up to her.
You were right before.
I hope Tom can help me.
You have the right to be happy.
What is your rating?
I have a problem with my boss.
It's a banana.
Tom will probably be punished for what he did.

Step aside.

How's your wife doing, Tom?

I wish you weren't such a fucking asshole.
Did Tom give you anything for me?
I could never have done this without your help.
I always have coffee and drinks for breakfast.
I'm hungry because I haven't had breakfast.
I'm the best.

He's walking.
Tom is not in town.
I was wearing shoes.
Next year will be worse.

Tom sat at the window.
Tom is just like the rest of them.

The public debt is growing.
Why am I me and not you?
Tom will probably never do that.
It's a doll.
Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a tough night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could have done that.
I'm a teacher.
You had a good time, didn't you?
I was born in 1997 in Osaka.
You have a beautiful voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom won’t do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends a lot of time on the Internet.
You're charming.
Tom said he would complain.
Let's meet him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest that.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom leaves in 30 minutes.
I don't know who Tom sold his car to.

Would you like some more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change a diaper.

When is she coming?
That's not my style.
Try to focus.
I’m so glad I did it yesterday.
Tom still lives near you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.
Does she have a dog?
I was a magician.
Don't interrupt me when I'm talking.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you see him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
It's a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the two-thousandth year.
Tom will probably take care of it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a short peace, the war broke out again.

What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you pass me the sugar?
Where exactly is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On the chair."
I don’t think there will be any problems.
Did Tom break up?
You need a haircut.
Green suits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it all work?
You're very ugly.

I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.

Tom walked out of the room.
I still do it every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He won the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thought he could do it.
I don't have books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember the first time we met?
My job is very boring.
He is, so to speak, a robot man.
Answer the question!
I need you in the hospital.
I can't find the lifts.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He felt tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I have no friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope so.
It's sad, but it's true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Grand Prix.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my native language.
I had no friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I am too rich.
What's this girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Tom doesn’t have to do it again.
They live here for ten years.

Her neighbor will take care of the children while she is away.

Tom was blind from birth.
He didn't answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren’t you starting to get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I'm not working for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
I tried to do just that.
I wrote a book.
Quiet, please.
I bought my son a new sled.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko, she was born the same year as me, and now she's preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday will probably be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I disagree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.

Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should see a doctor.

It's snowing today.
She continued to work.

What's in the garage?
Don't you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how it is done.
Aren't you seeing anyone?
All the shops are busy.
I have not yet made a decision.
What is today's date?
Where's Dad?
Lock the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple from the apple tree does not fall far.
Be realistic.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s brother or mother’s brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
See you after the show.
I would like to ask a question.
That's my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom joined the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm thrifty.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are these?
That's what you want to do, right?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book by Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Shikoku, Honshu and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have a lot of money in the bank.
I think we need to go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
Let's go.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one can compete with him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She committed suicide.
We equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay in advance.
Are you sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren’t you planning to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to pick up my book.
I am still teaching French.
Tom will do it immediately.
Let's sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I'm wearing boots.
You can count on me.
His book became an object of criticism.
That would be genius.
I'm really scared.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's much worse.
I'm under the fly.
You haven't wasted your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary's case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask your name?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should stop smoking.
I think Tom is cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Can you play the violin?
Can you pass me the salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
Sami was popular among both students and teachers.
Tears of grief will not help.
He plays football and runs.
You can go anywhere you want.
We'll meet Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up the phone.
I'll be back soon.
The church is at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why would I do that to you?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do so.
Tom is calling you.
You have to tell Tom to do it.
He speaks Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get away with it.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit down.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom comes to my party.
Tom told me that he doesn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When Tom was younger, he was a ladies' man.
I'll deal with it.
Did you find any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
Are you a magician?
Am I good?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Back off.
Will you let Tom move on with you?
You are a beautiful woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom gave Mary a beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't here?
Kids are growing up so fast.
Tom likes to talk.
I want to play cards.
He went back to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?

Nobody cares.
They tried.
Is Tom and Mary still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn't help me do that.
I would like to withdraw the money.
I shook Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
He is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom started the thread.
Instead of going to school, he stayed at home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You don't have to trust her.

Tom still wants to come.
You can't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your vacation?
Did you get a Christmas present from Tom this year?
I am still a little bored at home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have trouble remembering.
Where's Mom?
He regained consciousness three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You don't have to talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check your voice mail.
She speaks three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind schedule.
Tom is not a hero.
Is it possible to get a taxi?
Hurry up or you'll be late.
It will be difficult.
Is Tom always like that?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn't want to speak so loudly.
Our team needs your help.
You never lie.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It will work, you’ll see.
She left him.
Tom is safe.
I finally got my driver’s license.
I'm not a student.
Mary was sorry.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom is constantly checking his phone.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, but Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I'm not planning on rocking the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something.
I'm with a client.
I'm disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn't you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Hi. Hi.
Please write your name in pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She completely ignores me.
Tom goes to the party tonight.
I was talking.
She was headed to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this would happen?
What's that?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, then Esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we are going?
Tom doesn’t know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Tom said what exactly happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
Did you tell Tom I was joking?
Tom was terribly bored.
Tom said I was good.
I'll be in the lab.
Please wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Do they suspect me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the rubbish.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister, as always, is wonderful.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like this perfume?
How awful!
Are you in a hurry?
I don’t have two cats.
When you hire him for a job, you should consider his youth.
We're sure it wasn't an accident.

He knows I love him.
I don't believe it.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.

I know it will be impossible.
Do you have any headaches?

I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We usually speak French.
Bananas are delicious.
They eat.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they are worthless.
Have you tried talking to them?
To do this was much harder than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Let me talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I said.
I doubt Tom can win.
Aliens are coming and taking our work away from us. Earth for Earthlings! Let's deport the Martian!
Don't worry.

Will you take the train?
Tom said Mary was beautiful.
He can no longer go.
Tom and Mary are still asleep, aren't they?
Do you like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Gather your toys together.
To do this was much harder than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I'm feeling better.
Are these people crazy?
Tom is interesting.
Have you finished your work?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It's easy to do.
Tom is dead.
I like to be alone.
We were both drunk.
I am not as tall as my brother, but taller than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask you for help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I have never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary will not be.
You missed something.

You seemed interested.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.

You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a Halloween costume?

We're not a couple.
The student wants to see you.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm starting to get a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Do you really think anyone is listening?
You don't need a pass!
Tom, you might say, is good.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom has a hangover.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
You understand?
Tom was not rude to me.
How to say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's asleep.

Would you mind opening the door?
Are you comfortable?

Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I played baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got my ticket for free.
You are such an unbearable person.
What's going on here?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, she's priceless.
I am very interested in learning French.
Behaved well to the cat, please.
I don’t have time to read.
Do you have a flashlight that I could borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your work.
Do you work nearby?
You admit that, don't you?
I have things to do tomorrow.
I'm sloppy.
You are always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You are very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain again.
I share everything.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
It was canceled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom is okay.
I don't sleep well.
Aren't you going to buy that?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did that?
Did you do it?
I have trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I dance pretty well.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It's obviously cheaper for you to spend the night with us.
He doesn’t watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a metro.
Are you ready to help us?

It was extremely surreal.
These students are Koreans.
Get out of here!
What's your last name?
Tom and Mary plan to retire when they are sixty-five years old.
Can I use your phone?
Your suffering comforts me.
When did you do something for me?
We closed the door.
There he is!
We are different.
Do Tom and Mary know?
Are you all right?
Do not sleep with the light on.
He's not stupider than you.
Trains in Serbia are very slow.
I think Tom is evil.
"Horses" is the plural of the word "horse".
Where's the ashtray?
Can you explain what you're talking about?
I'm sorry I didn't tell Tom the truth.
He didn't dare say no to my plan.

It was part of the plan.
Many stars were seen in the sky.
The apple from the apple tree does not fall far.
We wait until they leave.
Tom changed his face.
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
I used to live next door to Tom.
Speak louder, please.
You can sit wherever you want.
I think Yumi's sick.
The price reflects the demand.
Why do you like her?
You're still angry, aren't you?
The fence needs to be painted.
We need to call Tom.
It's good that you could help.
Run and don't look back.
We're on our way home.
I hate interviews.
Tom picked up the magazine.
To know a person well, it is enough to travel with him for one week.

I hope no one steals my stuff.
I am no longer a teacher.

You can go there.
Only a few questions have answers.
I dropped my keys.
Tom couldn’t win.
She went to the movies with him.
What is Tom doing for Christmas?
Put your handcuffs on him.
I know Tom doesn't know why I wanted to do it.
Tom ate something.
He chose his father’s religion.
I had to refuse.
Parents should accompany their children.
Tom said he wanted to meet you.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom shrugged.
These things are subject to customs clearance.
I'm sure you're very busy.
Protect me!

I'll answer one more question.
I'm going to work now.
Don't believe everything you hear about Tom.
Spring has arrived.
I look forward to my own birthday.
Not so much!
I can wait if you want.
I am very grateful for everything you have done for me.
Don't talk to me.
Behave yourself.
