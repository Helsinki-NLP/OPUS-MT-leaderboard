Inflation in Europe jumps because of food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November's price growth in 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after 2.6 percent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 percent was recorded, the Luxembourg statistical office of the Union reported.
The official forecast was only 3%, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian Emission Banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate, with the decline, along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment, leading to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, but close to them.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to “betray” inflation so that it doesn’t have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation stands at 3.3 percent, a 15-year record; in Spain, it has risen from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has erupted due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
Wheat prices rose by 88 percent and soybean prices reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in the world markets rose by 52 percent this year, and last month it already cost one barrel of black gold almost $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 percent in 2008 to 2.5 percent this year, but it will already fall to 1.9 percent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will continue to be approximately 3%, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement, after prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, has grown significantly, and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the socialists Gallup Institute has never measured such low - 13 percent support.
In the case of some voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would amount to more than two-thirds (71%) of the support compared to a fifth of the support of the MFA.
According to the survey, the IMF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entering parliament: their support for the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, there are supporters of both camps by one percent more.
Public opinion on the economy has also deteriorated due to the previous low - the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families are now more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after spring and summer more promising prospects.
As for next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth expects improvement.
In December, 71 percent of the polled, the most polled by the Gallup Institute to date, said the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny is believed or very much believed by 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s share of supporters is 38 percent.
54% do not trust the Prime Minister, 27% do not trust the Fidesz leader.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without a change of government.
While the government and prime minister’s stay was considered desirable by 35 percent after last October’s riots, it is now only 20 percent, with the relative majority (33 percent) seeing the solution only in the drafting of new elections.
Significant for the interest in the referendum is that 60 percent of respondents answered a question about their possible participation, that it would certainly come to the referendum, and another 20 percent said it would probably come.
By comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly only be attended by 55 percent and another 15 percent consider their participation probable. The success of the referendum would be unquestionable on the basis of current intentions.
A schoolboy would say no to 74, a doctor's fee of 79, and a hospital stay fee of 84 percent.
If we look at the same proportions only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of tuition fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of the price of Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budapest Trade Triangle maintained last year’s average price level growth of 16 percent, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
The usual Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Christmas shopping basket in the Budaörs Trade Triangle rose by an average of 16 percent this year, but the price in all hypermarkets showed an increase of over a thousand forints.
Since prices in food supermarkets "flew out" in December last year, the percentage due to the former high base did not show such a drastic price increase.
But it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they were able to buy for less than nine thousand forints last year, they will not get even for ten thousand.
The Daily Economy consumer basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10 573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, however, cruel breasts, nuts and poppy seeds were very expensive.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread even for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with a deposit, the product cost only 257 forints.
This year, however, according to the Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Auchan magazine’s consumer basket, it appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices appearing in the Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g’s consumer basket rose by 15 percent last year, compared to those of both Tesco and Auchan’s about 18 percent last year.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest values of the consumer basket, the difference was 12 percent, while the increase between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was on average 1,480.
The average price increase last year came to 1,206 forints, with prices being affected by the increase in VAT last Christmas.
It was this process that disrupted trade, and the department stores clearly failed to decide how large the price ranges should be for each product, as they were unable to predict the impact of the price change on consumption.
(If a trader misplans the speed of circulation of a given product, the price range adapted to the intensity of circulation may result in a significant loss of profit.)
Due to VAT, the rise in the price of the Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g consumer basket last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest one was 844 forints.
This year, the extreme difference did not manifest itself, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and also the cheapest one cost 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, prices showed a catastrophic increase, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, does not completely confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured an increase in prices of more than 30 percent over 12 months for several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Daily Economy Consumption Basket, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which was quite expensive last year, showed a price growth of barely more than 10 percent, even in the worst case.
Meal suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push for drastic price increases even in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trading golden triangle do not complain, they still report on a good year.
In our experience, most customers in the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
They buy everything by quantity, they take durable food by wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets formed long queues at the cash registers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, in the countryside, the turnover is lower, several international chains complain to research companies that sales are also lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to improper use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overcrowding of the staff to stop the disease do not help, says the head of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, they are also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of St. John's Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same site at the beginning of the year.
The patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
Until December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens had been reported to the National System of Nessocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>, Prime Minister of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multi-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, the rest are unknown.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant golden staphylococcus.
The bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by a third of people in the nose without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. cervical inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infection, early infection) respond well to antibiotics and can be well treated.
However, if antibiotics are given excessively or inappropriately, a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics will develop a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in inadequate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened organism, low body weight or in patients of years can cause serious hospital infections, such as early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief physician of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections in hospitals belong to daily practice.
"Infection should not be confused with an epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not studied."
Resistant to antibiotics
“We are isolating these patients, treating them with rubber gloves and masks, and we have the antibiotics we need to treat them,” Nyulasi said.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital-acquired MRSA infections could be prevented, but current conditions in home hospitals are not conducive to preventing the onset and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Since this infection occurs symptomatically in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients admitted and immediately isolate MRSA carriers.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
The National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these investigations.
Most cases are detected if the patient suffers from a detectable MRSA infection, the head of the epidemiological center said.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine, and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, disease reports.
There is a need to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, although hospitals do not comply in all cases.
The collection of microbiological samples is even rarer in basic and outpatient treatment of patients, said Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Saves on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but there are also serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters apart.
Unfortunately, as Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1> noted, we can also find that in hospitals that are in an unfavorable material situation, there are few disinfectants, nurses and many patients, which increases the chances of infections.
According to Karolina Böröczov<0xC3><0xA1>, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less common or the further spread of the causative agent of the disease can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is being fought everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has drafted a program to prevent MRSA or reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections are showing a declining trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks the prevention of multi-resistant disease agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these agents as its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXII district, who caused the fatal accident, is complete.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who killed pedestrians on Tuesday and who has since resigned from his post, was driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotics, said the spokesman of the High State Prosecutor's Office of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday, after the expert opinion of the case was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain did not drink any alcohol before he got behind the wheel.
The then-director of the police department of the XXIIth district knocked down his own car in Lajos Kossuth street in the XXII district on Tuesday, turning off a fifty-five-year-old man who stepped in front of him while crossing the road outside the marked crossing.
(The last mentioned fact that the pedestrian passed beyond the zebra, after all, according to the rules of the road is not a mitigating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
As a result of these events, the district police director resigned and asked for his retirement, according to police reports, because he was so shocked by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated with prosecutors conducting investigations from the outset.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three loan frameworks totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for Hungary's budgetary financing of transport and environment projects supported by the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract now signed concerns the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
A loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million is also used to finance education-related projects on a budget.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million contract, which the budget will use mainly for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also a discussion about the 4th metro line.
The parties agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the subway, it will return to whether and how the original agreement should be modified.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commitment fee shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is a real estate paradise of the EU
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of all of Europe is turned to the formerly somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys in the still cheapest, but fast-growing EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European destination for property purchases is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and seaside houses.
Of the mountains are the most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovets, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast and Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties in the vicinity of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also arouse investor interest, and more and more buyers are also shopping in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
Also the capital city of Sofia is a promise of enticing opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is well on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf resorts in Europe, becoming a popular destination in the summer and winter seasons as well as in the next two seasons.
Predictive investors are already buying in bulk, for example in the vicinity of Bansko.
According to analysts, property buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but buyers also come from France, Belgium, Spain and increasingly also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers near the Black Sea and in the ski havens.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settlers buy either renovated properties worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50-<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000, or run-down old houses for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5-15,000, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is shoppers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group consists of commercial investors who buy in the hope of a rise in value in the medium or long term.
The increase in real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is growing stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but they have risen by 21% annually over the past five years.
The rise in real estate prices far outweighs wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to Environment and Water Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and after Wednesday's official opening, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue with ministerial meetings.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are negotiating the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the emission reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, a turbulent debate is taking place between developing and developed countries.
The United States also announced that it now does not want to negotiate exact numbers, although it is leaning towards an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big issue of the conference is whether developed countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also accept the provision of both material and technological assistance to the countries that rely on it.
An agreement was also born on subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member Governing Board, most likely within the framework of the UN World Environment Programme (GEF), according to Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Minister of the Environment and Water Management G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, on behalf of Hungary, supports the EU's efforts to maintain a leading role in global climate protection efforts and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "Agreement after 2012", and is ready to commit to a 30% reduction if other developed regions of the world, or developed countries, are willing to accept responsibilities and commitments corresponding to their capabilities.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves a target of a 5.2% reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8%.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill.
There is a lot going on in Bali, as an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy needs to be adopted within two years, otherwise its entry into force would be confidently postponed until 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce set by the Kyoto Protocol would not immediately be followed by a new system of emission reductions, the necessity of which was also pointed out by the UN's international climate change science body, the IPCC.
This would delay the reduction of emissions and inevitably increase the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
British military units are posting videos of events in Iraq and Afghanistan that promote themselves on a video-sharing server.
First, the British Air Force (RAF) liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken with a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are inspected by the Air Force Command in charge of combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent back to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is unavoidable
In this form, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have already been accessed on the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have already looked at their "channel".
The British Department of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenseheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Department of State (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released the videos according to its original intention for recruitment and, according to the Department of Defense, they are also good for informing the general public about the real purpose of the army’s presence abroad.
“Promotion published in this form is almost worthless compared to traditional television recruitment ads,” said defense expert Gordon Mackenzie, “but it also necessarily carries a political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions decided by the government.”
The Americans made a game.
The army is worried that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, officers talk about losses at the most, but there is no bloody form of fighting.
Many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during a sharp deployment, have already been made available to the Internet, but the British army has only come to them now.
Americans conduct recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can through a more or less faithful simulation get directly into the skin of the soldiers.
There will be Christmas in the Ministries with a raccoon and sackcloth
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthov<0xC3><0xA1> is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will hold a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to pog<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ky and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere they will enchant the Christmas atmosphere with a toast and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a buffet - that's how the powerful enjoy themselves.
Public authorities are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it does not expect its employees to attend.
At Christmas, orphans will receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, during the Missionary Christmas they will host family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort spends $25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) are kicking themselves out of the game compared to other ministries.
The GKM party is held in the centre of Jöv<0xC5><0x91> H<0xC3><0xA1>za, for a total of 4,320,000 forints, and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the Ministry.
The resort will adhere to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will also be drawn.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Judicial Council (OIT) - concerts and dinners were on the program.
The rent of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: the tendering company, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money, will organize there.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z Theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information because we have not been able to reach the person concerned.
There is no need for a dress
The OIT building was hosted not only by the NFÜ, but also by the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia Ball instead of Christmas on December 7.
However, the OIT did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with a toast to the minister, after dinner it was possible to dance accompanied by live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball there were no mandatory evening dress or suit.
The Puritan party is being prepared by the ministries of health, work and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperthov<0xC3><0xA1> does not even officially invite her colleagues to the Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and pods, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Self-Government, and his associates will simply drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Self-Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will hold a Christmas meeting, at which it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
The Christmas party is donated 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with buffets and a toast.
Since Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is strengthened not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The Ministry of Agriculture holds a New Year's reception on January 20, the Ministerial Christmas is not held.
Reception will take place in the Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r Castle in the City Gardens, and according to the Ministry’s announcement, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions begin with a brief toast to the minister and end with a small treat.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not hold Christmas parties at all, the relevant press departments told the portal [origo].
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Art.
He's headed for a huge strike.
The League of Trade Unions, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday's indefinite strike.
A protest public assembly will be held on Saturday, and work will be halted on Monday - the day of the final vote on the health insurance law.
The action will surely cause serious traffic disruptions, as rail transport will be almost completely stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will strike within 13 hours.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association together with the National Union of Workers' Councils will acquaint with the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA-MOSZ, which will coordinate Monday's action.
On Saturday, a public protest rally is held, and from Monday, unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely unless an agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no date has been set for the end of the strike, which will begin on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament ultimately fails to pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strikes.
However, if the legislation is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Parliament's Monday agenda, it is also possible that the health insurance law will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
Due to Monday's start of the strike, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: work will be stopped indefinitely on the railway, part of Budapest's public transport can be stopped in the morning, and more than half of the companies Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n.
At the same time, half of the road will be closed in many parts of the country.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organizations joined the call for a strike, the list of which is constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations have announced an indefinite strike, while others have announced a temporary cessation of work.
By Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (M<0xC3><0x81>V) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ) had not even been able to agree on sufficient services, with more and more people travelling by rail at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of the operation until 13.00 at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, and the Trade Union of Educators and the Democratic Trade Union of Educators called for a 2- and 2-hour stoppage of work, respectively.
The Union of Hungarian Physicians will strike alternately across the country, and the Democratic Union of Workers in Health and Social Care (EDDSZ), a member of the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the proposal for health insurance reform and put forward a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions valid from next year be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, in the case of early retirement, the possibility of inclusion in the system for the relevant occupational sectors should be ensured before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Workers (VDSZSZ), belonging to the League trade union, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases Country's Risk
The activities of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
The company's "risk warning" states: in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "by exacerbating the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Romani populations of Hungary, violent ethnic clashes may occur in the short term".
The main reason is that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy is likely to provoke such an action, the research institute adds.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the biggest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: "the public discussion on the Roma issue was left by the representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction."
This problem deepens, prevents normal dialogue, strengthens extremists, and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "significantly distorted the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
As part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-right groups, which have gained increasing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which call themselves "national defence associations".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civic associations, while openly proclaiming - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, invading the homeland, disturbing the order), in addition to pointing to the inability of the police, the army, or the state," he added.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap all sorts of political efforts built on society’s resistance to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
Therefore, the emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups not only serves to avoid the legal pitfalls of judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-enhancing factor from the point of view of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out in several neighbouring countries as a potential source of danger, and ultranationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologise for their own anti-Hungarian policies by appealing to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can affect the political stability of the region," he added.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
According to him, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the backdrop of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of Sofia’s districts (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used this to establish a guard, saying that the organization's goal was "national defense".
In the past 17 years, she said, there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent.
He adds that the initiative sparked a turbulent debate among the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guards as a sign of resistance.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is possible that the Hungarian Roma will react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own militia, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, Research Director of the Political Capital Institute, said that risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if they find anything that could affect the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not free everywhere
In Hungary, the days off are determined precisely by law and it has already become a common practice that working days are moved around the holidays, which we expect less times in the next year.
In the European Union and America, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and days of rest.
Days of rest are usually associated with church holidays or important historical events.
Here we also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old and the first day of the new year is a work holiday - on the New Year, so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
During the year, we have 11 free holidays.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848, and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1st work, on November 1st and 2nd we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, the two-day holidays are Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day if we only work one day before or after a holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that the previous Saturdays we stayed in the workplace and at school.
The day that immediately precedes or follows the holiday, when we work, has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or operate even on days of rest.
This year there will be a change of working conditions only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to the experience so far, most people will "work" in advance between Christmas and New Year's Eve or use the saved vacation in this way.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer shifts of the working day than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around the holiday of work, so that workers can stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday the 26th of April will be a working day, so that Friday the 2nd of May can be a rest day.
Another transfer is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will be done instead of Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely in the sign of holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost non-stop holidays everywhere, despite the fact that New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Disturbing Things You Can Do to Annoy Your Colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we almost never notice: all of this "spreads up" the weekdays in the workplace.
The question is, do you get used to these little inconveniences, or put on gloves, and deliberately avoid unclear situations that can make others angry.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed the meeting for that?
At best, he regrets it and will try to fix it, or call the marketing department and say that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is resolved with one apology.
Before there is any embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to prevent it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than stretching out for a piece of paper, office supplies, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember putting a stapler on your desk yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you find a pen on the desk of one of your colleagues that you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will rightly be angry at you for messing with their things.
Do not take envelopes or adhesive paper out of the office, as it can be uncomfortable when you run out of it prematurely, and you will need it immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the rumors from spreading.
Who, who, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone your news (suppositions) about the private life of colleagues!
When one of them shares his innermost secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you claiming your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence, citing a severe headache, because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think about the fact that your work, urgent tasks and work with a certain deadline will have to be done for you by someone else.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you won’t go to work the next day, or that something might happen that will make you have to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and supervisors aren’t confronted with your absence until the next day.
Popping, giggling, telephone
Have you been immersed in a job that will rudely rip you out of the whining of your colleagues?
Inadvertently, have you witnessed a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by humming, chanting, loud talking (them overhead), or kicking, constantly swearing, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for their mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not refer to the chaos in the office and the noisy colleagues!
Recognize if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and repair the damage!
Ask how you can put things in order, correct negligence!
Do you feel at home in your office?
Sweatshirts and slippers: comfortable clothes for home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear casual clothes, even if your profession allows it!
Don’t be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in a regular dress – and if your profession requires it, nice and elegantly!
When a man wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Moving in the usual morning constipation.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
Adding volume.
Music changes the tempo and the previous tone colors are added to the bass, then the female choir joins as a real jewel.
On mr2 there is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music life has not spoiled us with high-quality electronic pop for a long time.
Suddenly, the constipation looks quite different, because you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, is slowly changing the overall image, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its beating into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started at the Petit-Cathedral, and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until finally - perhaps because two nipples don't fit in the same charade - he set out on his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he only began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
Ferenc Török's film "Season").
His band, which played in smaller clubs at the beginning, came to know a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entity determining the development that could be sold in the West.
Zagar and his band are no doubt “on course”, although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band reacted as they should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open new paths for them, although the title itself tries to create a sequel to the initial flights in P<0xC4><0x9B>tikostel<0xC3><0xAD>.
This is one verse from the composition of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger’s old band there.
A reference to the etheric, flying would be in place, but in addition to the etheric tinge of this music now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the times - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
These songs featured György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with The Puzzle, at the premiere of the album in Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris Park.
The album was also produced by one real radio hit, thanks to the mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, playing popular music recently from morning to evening, we started to play fluttering melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
The portal hvg.hu interviewed Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how long does what you play remain marginal music?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, they say nothing, and it can be created just for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can spring from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted, regardless of language and state borders, also works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the west, light music has a greater tradition.
Not only teenagers and people in their twenties go to concerts there, but also the elderly.
They are much more aware of the changes in light music that are taking place around them, because they also consider it part of contemporary culture.
HVG.HU: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who listens to your music, where and how much?
B. Zs.: Of course, it feels good to see more and more people coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born with a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be seen in concerts, where mutual influence already works, but this is hidden only in the intangible changes of the moment.
However, I noticed that if a person wants to please the audience, from that moment on he ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and has built his career rather from us to the west.
B. Zs.: In fact, we do not follow his path, regardless of the fact that they sometimes try to explain our music.
We are rather team players who rely on each other’s musical presence and let it evolve.
At first, of course, it was impossible not to compare our work with the songs of Yonderboie, because a few of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the top of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, Wings of Love came first.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open up to wider layers?
B.Z.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, with which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex topics.
HVG.HU: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Z.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir from the soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir - Sena, Edin Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we then renamed to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you intended the song, or did the girls change something about it?
B.Zs.: The song had existed in the instrumental version for a long time, and then when the material came together on the record, we thought that something else would be needed for this song.
A sequence of chords led to a singing part being added to it.
That night I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out very spontaneously for the first time.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it took Diva to do it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work that energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert, it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don’t have solos (except Judy Jay), they don’t have their own role, they sing all together, and they’re not louder than music, so music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were standing in the back of the stage, too.
On purpose?
B.Z.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we did not want to distribute solo roles, on the contrary, is intentional.
The song is about forgetting our ego, where we come from, where we belong, and letting ourselves be lifted up by the wings, the wings of love.
I wish that the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
HVG.HU: What was the most work done?
B.Zs.: When composing music, in fact, not with one, the heavier pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where the groove did not work for a long time, then everything slowly found its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Z.: This is constantly changing with the concert and the fact that I have already “released” this album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
Betrayal broker risking billions of dollars of undervalue
A treacherous defrauder.
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Komer<0xC4><0x8D>n<0xC3><0xAD> bank, calls his vain employee Jerome Kerviel.
It cost him nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
Rather, it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to compete with his colleagues and, moreover, definitely not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market in time.
"He's mentally weaker," his superiors said, sending police to him.
However, according to Kerviel’s testimony, which was brought by French media such as Le Monde, he was a man who made <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion in profits from his trades at the end of last year.
The crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in his resignation statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros from the US crisis.
He felt the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to surface that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who in the past had problems with repayment, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he bet correctly.
At the end of the year, its profit climbed to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.6 billion.
"As soon as I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he hadn't kept anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to falsifying the records so that he would not be discovered.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex exchange was beginning to take an interest in his trades.
Risk is Profit
Was he afraid of being found out?
I don't think so.
“I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where did he get the will to take so much risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never earn as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and my professional and personal development,” Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first great success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz made a profit, because in the bombing of London, he bet on the decline of this title half a billion euros.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told police.
But the bosses said they knew everything, or rather they knew it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
He lost one billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to make it go away.
When he returned to work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days for the past year.
“A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has a chance to win 365 billion
Yesterday, the Czech government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic could receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately CZK365 billion) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme is designed to serve entrepreneurs and businesses to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Companies should raise funds for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful countries in drawing money from EU funds.
20-Year Sentence for Nicaraguan Ex-President Confirmed by Court
An appeals court in Nicaragua on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Aleman, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (nearly CZK 1.8 billion).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest at his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of the Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return to prison is unclear at this time.
According to Ileana Perez, the president of the appeals court, it will now be up to prison officials to let Aleman serve his sentence at home or go to jail.
Four years ago, the court proved to Aleman that he regularly transferred government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of that money ended up in a fund Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n set up to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget has been adopted.
What makes this budget exceptional?
It is the first budget drafted by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without opposition support.
He passed this year with the support of the CSSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and the CSSD could not afford his rejection.
Unlike the heated debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, law calmly.
It's kind of a paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether someone likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power rivalry with the opposition.
This is more media grateful and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
Guessing politicians is much more interesting to the public than stern numbers.
The state budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered three ailments that the 2008 government has not been able to solve at once:
The first of them is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandate expenditures, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the CSSD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit management as a consequence of the disease of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the time bomb is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in order to obtain additional resources for investment in addition to tax money, fees and loans from banks, often recklessly issued bonds with which they disproportionately indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have that source.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, like the rest of the world, and the CSSD is constantly bragging about it.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government is increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more intelligently than our republic.
This is an embarrassment, which falls mainly on past governments.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, unnecessarily swelled to gigantic dimensions.
Although some of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections has been abolished, if the retirement and pension reform thresholds are not moved in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will end, and whoever rules it will be just office.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the taxed money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the expulsion of normal expenditures by mandate expenditures.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would have been totally useless if past governments had not managed as much as they could in the last ten years.
If we do not want to make the ruling politicians mere officials, then we must be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government, which realizes that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, to be calm about the preparation of other reform laws.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
More than $100 billion will go to the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Federal Reserve will auction $40 billion and then make another $24 billion available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that national central banks have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is to address the economy’s biggest challenge, the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl, of the Economic Outlook Group, said in a statement.
“Coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, mainly in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of dollars in losses.
“Central banks must be really worried about what else can happen when they decide to do this,” said ABN’s chief economist, Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession, with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to lower the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money in the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about lending each other money, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK lowered their interest rates several times in the fall.
"It will have the same effect as the next fall in interest rates," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will contribute to the resolution of the crisis, because it does not solve the underlying problem, and this is the collapse of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is most likely to harm developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been voiced at the end of the UN’s international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, Not the Green Planet, he said the debates among environmentalists were unbelievable.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference, which consists of a strange mix of representatives of governments and NGOs, unacceptable, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President, when presenting his book, stressed that its topic was very important for him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only encounter caricatures of my views".
Now, those interested can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he believed that he had sufficient prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
The main conclusions of the book are the thesis that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus among all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptablely expensive.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totalitarianism, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
Asked repeatedly, he explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits."
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver did not manage to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers missed the deadline and failed to change their old driving license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new card by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the card was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp decline in interest in the exchange of a driver's license, authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed with applications and interest in the exchange of a license has risen this week.
The magistrate handles about 2000 clients per day.
They wait about half an hour in line.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet changed their driver’s license.
The issuance of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for extradition within a reduced period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay $500.
Motorists who fail to make the mandatory change of license by the end of the year, and go on the road without a valid driver's license, will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by arranging.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to CZK 2,500.
According to earlier information, a fine could have been received from the town hall even by a person who was not going anywhere.
He could have paid as much as 30,000 crowns.
The ministry had earlier called on the authorities to be moderate and impose a maximum fine of 1,000 crowns.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, there is no threat of a fine of tens of thousands.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document with which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not a valid ID card that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driving license.
You just need to take it or send it by registered mail to the competent municipal authority.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to apply.
However, motorists need to gradually change other types of driving licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to exchange.
Passports issued between 2001 and 2004 will expire in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are approximately 2.6 million additional documents.
Court Cuts Penalties for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Kona<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for 13 and 10 years.
The Prague Supreme Court decided on this with definitive force, which thus reduced their sentences, one by one year and the other by two years.
Originally, the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime threatened detectives for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision cannot be appealed, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is awaiting a first-instance verdict.
In other trials, however, he has already received sentences totalling more than 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Regional Court in particular found 19 people guilty of participating in robbery, the Supreme Court today resolved appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the indictment since the start of the investigation, saying it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang donated 30 percent for Opava and Horseman.
The indictment includes criminal activity by a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious harm to their health, but also abuse of the authority of a public official and illegal armaments.
During house searches, police found illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, laser sights or a machine gun.
The gang allegedly robbed tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the trial, the courts have already found Berdych and many others guilty of other robberies.
Other men in Berdych's neighborhood are still testifying before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main case has so far been evaded by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC3><0xB3>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Children's substitution bill: 12 million
In exchange for children in the maternity hospital, Igor Veleba, a lawyer for the damaged families, seeks compensation of CZK 12 million after the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital, plus court expenses.
Three million for each mother, two million for the father and one million for the children.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, therefore fundamentally disagrees with Veleba’s proposal.
"We reject such a request, which is very, very high," he said after today's meeting.
"But in order to get an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion, which the counterparty had to draw up.
Let's see if it has any indicative value at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," he stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the family from Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov wanted a million crowns for each month when they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for the negotiation of compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motol.
Parents of children, according to experts in the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress in various degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, although they were faced with remorse that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, in turn, are less able to cope with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, Velebo summed up the content.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> maternity hospital on December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kovs in P<0xC5><0x99>ibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojanov<0xC3><0xA1> in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>ov.
At the end of October, the Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Governor Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il donated 100,000 crowns to each of the families to compensate them for the expenses incurred by the mistake of the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of error, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally, they can ask for the help of the founder.
So far, the courts have granted relatively low compensation to people, the sums were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
Soup lost to the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava regional court, although the name was first used by the Wallachian king, the project built a long-term team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor.
The soup was not present today.
According to his lawyer, the case probably does not end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabis and his team are parasitizing on Bolko Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, everyone remembers actors and comedians in the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
Harabish has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work behind us.
“Finding money and inventing actions,” he said.
According to him, the cause of the dispute is money.
“Years later, they realised that the project was a success and that they could benefit from it.
They want to parasitize on our work,” he added.
The lucrative business
According to the court, the Wallachian king used Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the first time in his television program.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobogat<0xC3><0xBD>.
At that time, however, it had nothing to do with the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From the original recessive action, business and lucrative business activities emerged, which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then followed up with the foundation of the Wallachian Kingdom.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to put his name and signature in passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in the manoeuvre for his business plan.
"The popularity of Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka has certainly helped the Wallachian Kingdom project," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to it.
The cooperation of the now disaffected parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes began to build up between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the deposition of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I, elected for life".
At the instigation of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> took the leading role in the kingdom as Queen Mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> could bring about a battle over the throne and half of the princess.
A new king should come out of it.
Details and deadlines have not yet been revealed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can sign up," Harabis added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi test: disappearing prejudices
To be honest, I've never really fanned a Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of gearshifting, steering and also production could sometimes be called below-average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the van called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think better.
When I was testing the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the head space in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaint, because the body of the van means that even two-meter long ones will not suffer in this direction.
Flying around the world
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
This is a pretty good design, where I have only one complaint about the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more designer invention, when the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Also, the lateral guide has improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
Suitcases for suitcases
The main thing about this car is its luggage.
I have to evaluate it as very accessible (even thanks to the tilting rear window) and as neatly folding.
Deaf spots are equipped with restraint rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and at the same time it keeps even heavier objects.
But let's pause together over the hug.
According to the tables in the basic layout, it is 428 l, which is rather an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot lags by a very noticeable 52 liters.
On holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I have to highlight the positives, I still have to mention a completely flat floor after the backrests of the second row are folded or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre petrol four-cylinder with a power of 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 16-year-old who drives a family hatchback should look like.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to the s<0xC5><0x82>owacky analogy, which sometimes acts as if it has a rag stuffed in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price list says
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a gasoline fourteenth for 329 900 CZK will still go.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment then delivers the equipment for an additional 80,000 CZK to the top.
But we also had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic shutdown of wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>531,900.
It's a lot, but count the additional equipment with Fabia and you'll come up with a very similar number.
There is no choice but to choose a brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
There are more children from Eastern European countries in British schools, which raises concerns about the further development of local education among local settlers.
So far, the integration of Eastern Europeans has encountered a number of obstacles.
British schools even record cases where disputes between immigrants and indigenous children escalate into violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are starting to escalate.
Disputes, bullying and quarrels between pupils were also transferred to the relations between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a ten-year-old student with an iron rod.
She pleads guilty to being insulted by the boy with racist insults.
Police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The men’s girls reportedly praised him with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"As we were on our way home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he leaned on us with apples and pears and then revealed his ass,” the mother of Slovak students told The Times.
Complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even described the quarrels with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases suggest that the atmosphere at British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who came here to work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak pupils attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful Caribbean island
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can come true if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But only on one island you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
Under the Spaniards, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and a repository of treasures that the Spaniards in America plundered and transported to Europe.
And then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the US Mafia bosses Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the US (especially during the Prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were among others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses were built, and cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 1950s rode on wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought the estate in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and had his yacht in Co<0xC3><0xAF>mar.
On the walls of the Bodeguity del Medio left their signatures show business stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls in Bodeguita, Havana.
At the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional you can enjoy a cocktail according to your wishes.
And those iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving around Havana, because once imported stigmas and fiats in the salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is largely depleted, there are not as many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there are there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings much-needed money, its development is green.
Over the past 15 years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially on Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n, and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more pleasure, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
A third of the large plantations were transported by steam and motor trains to sugar factories along the narrow tracks.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, and so there are functioning machines, the peers of which are only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba will not miss.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Just to remind you that there is a museum in Hemingway’s estate, and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone base.
Mogots, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and fertile soil is attached to their cavities, thanks to which the weathered rocks are covered with dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can see its final form when you visit one of Havana’s cigar factories.
It may be interesting to see the Chilean part of Major Zeman being filmed there.
Trinidad (province)
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
The trade in slaves and sugar brought him fame and wealth.
Wealth was transformed into the beauty and exhibition of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that in the 1950s there was no road connecting the region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
There was nothing built there, so there was nothing plowed, everyone was glad to have a roof over his head.
If a person has more than one afternoon in Trinidad, then it is worth taking a look at interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n or the Sugar Valley.
In the evening you have to go to Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
A small town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely this view is already influenced by the path itself.
Both roads that lead from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must overcome high and rugged mountains and pass through nature, which human activity hardly marked.
The eastern island of Cuba has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its undisturbed nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (actually it was created about a hundred years after Columbus’ voyage) and from the hill where the former castle and today’s Hotel El Castillo stand, you can see several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra mountains, about the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana cabaret, about the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about the santeria, about the African religions professed by the descendants of former slaves, about all this could be described.
But, as they say, it’s better to see it once.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, say Americans
The lack of troops and the lack of necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to Defense Minister Robert Gates, should outline a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going as planned, the leaders of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to the growing resistance from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, called on NATO troops to step up their engagement, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and boosting development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military force can only be one part of the solution.
The other is to allow residents to start the further development of the economy and security on their own,” Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
Afghan insurgent activity is the highest in five years, according to the U.S. military.
The number of violent acts increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand by as much as 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the Allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In particular, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We’re going to have to think seriously about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
“I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three days of talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
In recent months, there has also been controversy among the participating countries over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passiveness.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid newspaper Sun this week called German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan swindlers exposed: Germans play while our boys fight," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went into counterattack and printed a picture of a British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt Will Rise to Trillions in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is over CZK 84,000.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget management.
The public debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance confirmed its data on the state debt from the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over CZK 84,000.
For the whole of last year, the state owed more than CZK 111 billion.
"For now, it seems that due to a lower deficit for next year, we could not exceed the threshold of a trillion crowns until 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," Patricia Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora sees it similarly: “We could get to exceeding one trillion during 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I don’t expect this change,” he said.
Debts are growing
Government debt is the debt of the central government and is mainly created by accumulating government budget deficits.
Government debt is financed by treasury vouchers, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the state so far this year has increased by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state so far this year has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable government debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of the national debt has increased to 6.5 years.
Total debt increased by 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarter, which is really a lot on how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand, it shows that it will have something to trade with when there is a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing the state debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to CZK 152.8 billion due to better development of the state budget management.
The amount consists mainly of the state budget deficit, which will probably reach CZK 76 billion this year instead of the expected CZK 91.3 billion.
It also includes the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a 10 billion reserve for pension payments, the financing of 43 billion crowns of government bonds and repayments of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear
A British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and expelled, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils name a teddy bear Muhammad despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was punished with whiplash.
The 45-year-old British teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several students filed a complaint with the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
Our story actually begins in September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
“There are eight names out of the children’s mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s director.
After a vote in the class, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohammed as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common first name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a teddy bear accompanied by a caption: “My name is Mohammed.”
The bear itself had no label with that name on it, but the difficulty is in portraying the prophet himself as an insult to Islam.
Gillian Gibbons, a fellow Muslim who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her mother well and would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: “I only regret asking children to vote for a name,” he said, “it’s an innocent mistake.”
This view is shared by many pupils of the teacher, who describe her as "very attentive to their pupils" and add that "never in the classroom talk about religion".
Recall that the first name Mohammed is also the second most commonly given first name in the UK, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This first name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to honor the Prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this first name?
For example, is it possible to give them to a toy?
Of course, it is a matter of interpretation.
In the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
On Wednesday morning, Serbs and Kosovo Albanians concluded the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides have not been able to reach an agreement on status," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His U.S. counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is “at stake” and urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to keep peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is clear that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
Negotiators of the Troika, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population, could emerge in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of talks since the UN commissioned the Troika to renegotiate in August.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
The Russians, who previously blocked Kosovo's independence in the UN Security Council, on the other hand, insist that the negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governance by the international community, the West considers Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovar President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the "last chance" talks had been held since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, a former insurgent leader of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the plan of autonomy presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to murders and deportations".
"Domino effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadi<0xC4><0x87>, on the other hand, believes that the compromise still comes into play and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo against the consequences of the province's unilateral declaration of independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But that does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
Kosovo parliament will have the final say
"Only a solution from the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“This process took two years.
It must end as it began: on the soil of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "Kosovo's parliament will have the last word on the status", adding that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush agrees with Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, convened on his initiative, US President George W. Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed to begin negotiations immediately with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised to do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations for both sides from the “road map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, led by Abbas, are aimed at “the conclusion of a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.”
The statement includes three issues at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in the 1948 conflict in what is now the state of Israel.
Abbas took the floor after the U.S. president and stressed that the subsequent talks should be “complete and thorough” and address all aspects of the solution, mentioning “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others.”
Olmert then spoke at the panel, expressing the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that "it is necessary to push for them to be concluded during 2008".
Bush defined the end of 2008 as a timeline for the realization of his “two-state vision”, Palestinian and Israeli, that existed side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it made a commitment to this effect from Bush before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, has initiated a proposal accepted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories captured during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means “a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights the roots of the conflict and its central aspects,” says Prince Saud in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper shielded by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such little reports from the black chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of an investigation by the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car drove through the Louise-Michel street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 5 p.m. on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in emergency mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, without the side lights on," a police source said.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore unlicensed on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was driving "at a very high speed".
“A motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left after not giving preference to the right,” a police officer said.
A blood alcohol promille test performed on the vehicle's crew turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (perforated front, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the severity of the impact.
The prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of unintentional killing and non-assistance to persons at risk", which at the same time takes over the direction of the départementale de la Valet'.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of police officers for the accident.
According to the official, three witnesses to the accident, who were questioned on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-engine approached them quite quickly from the left".
Some groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained jammed until the police car could brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was performed on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, rumors quickly spread among the people that police officers should quickly leave the crime scene without providing first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should, with all caution, also rule out "any serious wrongdoing" at this point.
“This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation that requires more investigations and with which you need to be very careful,” a police source said.
The Libération newspaper met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
“Immediately, my cousin, who is a nurse at the hospital, and I ran downstairs to try to resurrect them,” the witness said.
We couldn't do anything."
Then he saw "a limping, completely frightened policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was on the phone.”
Faced with the rapidly growing tension and confidence of those present that the situation of the young men was hopeless, the police officers were driven by the car of their colleagues, who had arrived at the scene in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about 20 minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to help the young people.
First aid was given to these young people.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan are on the rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, some 2,000 lawyers protesting against the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades that witnesses say were used by law enforcement.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several were to be summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers over the weekend.
The access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning in order to prevent the gathering.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement won support from religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president “invited the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and trash to those who swore an oath to Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise doesn't apply"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was due to speak about the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in the indirect presidential election held on 6 October.
Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, the president of the court, was removed and replaced.
“All we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against Supreme Court judgments,” the official said in a statement.
Parviz Musharraf’s promise to give up the leadership of the army and become a civilian president “does not apply” after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to relinquish his military uniform by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that the deputy head of the army should have ordered President Musharraf to house arrest.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes unintended pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unanticipated today, according to a study led by the Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined), the State Institute for Demographic Studies, 40 years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This calculation includes unintended pregnancies (24%), as well as poorly planned or unplanned pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, estimates Ined.
The law has allowed better “fertility control,” the institute says, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births are well planned.
One in five couples even have a birth calculated per month accurately and preferably in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant season for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to remarkably repair the torn solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the rate of "forgetting" that astronauts spent on repairs.
Trouble arose on Tuesday as astronauts from the Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese science laboratory (see box).
This module is a kind of landing pier for modules-laboratories.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew's second task, therefore, was to move the seventeen-pound solar-powered power-generating module, which was already on the ISS, to anchor at its final location.
After relocating it, the crew began decomposing the module's seventy-six-meter solar panels.
And in this, one of the panels, decomposing as a pulling harmonica,due to the pinching of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Decomposition has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to check out the Discovery ship and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was malfunctioning, were forced to deal with the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robot arm of the ship, added to the shoulder of the station, and repair it.
It is one of the best spacewalkers by the U.S. Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, strong, very agile, has a very developed chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, the original doctor was commissioned to "operate" a "wounded" solar panel.
After examining the damage in detail, he cut off the defective cable and fixed some "spray" to the damaged areas.
He was assisted by a second "spacewalker" who remained near the alignment chamber, and also from the inside, by other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey taped with an insulating agent to prevent electroshock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "cuttlefished" by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation ended, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely decomposed, then inventoryed his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day’s rest before today, when seven astronauts return to the ship Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday as scheduled.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange after the aerospace and defense company announced that it would have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to face the delay of the A400M.
EADS lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its projected production results for 2007 due to delays resulting from the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which is a prerequisite for the start-up flight.
The price for alleviating delays in deliveries of a military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than a billion for Airbus," the parent company of the European designer EADS said.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new earnings outlook before deducting interest and taxes (EBIT) when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that in 2006, EADS production results fell by 86%, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another program, namely the giant A380 aircraft.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
Decisions for the status quo
Sunday’s elections will be held without tense expectations: the Russians will overwhelmingly elect President Putin’s party, United Russia.
Thus confirming, after the end of the very little free election campaign, their tendency to stability, even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin will deliver a pre-recorded television message to voters on public broadcasters, the content of which is kept secret.
He is doing so as the leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that appears to be celebrating a crushing victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and was content with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite theme during the campaign.
“We know the value of true democracy and we want an honest, as transparent and open as possible election, an election without the slightest defect in beauty,” he said.
This is far from the case in the eyes of the opposition.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "never had such a dirty election, not even for Yeltsin."
After the repressions that accompanied the demonstrations last weekend, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, who was sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality"
Against the backdrop of these tense-waiting parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are profiling:
"Who will become Putin's successor in the presidential office?
Yesterday, the Official Gazette published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be prime minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful United Russia party, who will choose a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the full line in the parliamentary as well as the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they don’t feel they are masters of their own destiny,” said Lev Gudkov, a sociologist and director of the independent Levada Center.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes a more distant context: civil society, in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe, has accumulated a delay; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed the paternalist model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so because this new paternalism was not accompanied by terror, but by a certain economic prosperity," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "voluntarily give up personal responsibility", which they soon proved after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon applies to all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local candidates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Tamara Cherednichenko, a 45-year-old professor: “Why think?
Those in power aren’t so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are open to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored for 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) were, until that time, accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and specifically, at the request of the former victim or his authorized persons.
Eleven of the countries responsible for managing archives - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
As the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, the opening took effect yesterday.
Sensitive information
Historians’ free access to Bad Arolsen will allow them to examine “particularly the movements of prisoners, the camp population, and the health of forced laborers,” explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, CICR).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these nominal documents available to the public, due to the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labor subjected to civilians, to bring them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Antisemitism at the Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral trade between Europe and India amounts to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion per year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (accords de libre échange, ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Bilateral trade between Europe and India is already reaching almost 60 billion euros.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
“The free trade agreement is a huge boost to both economies,” and “India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans,” said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products exported by India, said the European Commission's new commissioner, Mr. Mani, and the European Commission's new commissioner, Mr. Jo, participated in the meeting. The Asian and European giants together will replace "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi, regretting that "their potential in bilateral trade".

Bank of England takes note of concerns and bids <0xC2><0xA3>10bn in five-week auction
The Bank of England said on Thursday it intends to ease current concerns about worsening credit market conditions again, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10bn <0xC2><0xA3>5.75bn bid at a five-week base rate, an unusually long one.
“In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks more certainty about how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation,” the Bank said in a statement.
The Bank specifies that <0xC2><0xA3>10bn (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14bn) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at a base interest rate.
It appears to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally they last a week.
BOE adds in its communiqué that it “remains ready to take further steps to keep interbank lending rates at the same level as its base rate in the interday period.”
The interbank interest rate was at 5.829 percent on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fee rates that discouraged banks from taking advantage of this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many preferred the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discretion guaranteed.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement popularaire, Union for the People's Movement) and NC (Nouveau Centre, New Centre) refuse to address Socialist (PS) purchasing power proposals
UMP and the Nouveau Centre refused on Thursday to discuss individual paragraphs of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which equates to rejecting the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the bill came within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and included a dozen measures adopted by the PS Presidency on Tuesday, including an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating TIPPs, a transport cheque or rent regulation.
As UMP and NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session was closed after a general debate that became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy's televised speech on purchasing power.
PS chief Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the amendment to the Finance Act, which will be discussed by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is launching a new festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer of the Vineland Festival in New Jersey announced in collaboration with Melvin Benn’s Republic Festival.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a man who has uncompromisingly inspired the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones, of C3’s Billboard.com, said in a statement.
C3 is produced by the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is a summer camper station.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the UK, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which today has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the "most inspiring event" he has ever experienced, saying his company and Melvin Benn's company are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Initially, we chose Philadelphia as a market, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
“We worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, we got into politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss it with Melvin Benn and we are going to start a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
In 2005, C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park, after excelling on the festival scene in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were 9.8M$ and 11.3M$.
Both of these festivals take place in an urban setting.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine the two concepts in a certain way to create both the impression of a rural festival in Europe and an urban festival in America.”
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastically supporting the event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but says they are “sufficiently advantageous to allow you to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will hopefully have a long duration.”
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is "very high", similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which holds 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is yet to be published.
“Vineland will have a rocky feel, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of viewers as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
The partners of C3, which received the Top Independent Promoter award at the latest Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasion mission is one of the delegate's tasks.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall "Governor" in the claws??
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is to promote the local film.
The Oscars have already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing Québec films, highlighting them and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
A few weeks ago, the Age of Darkness had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be unveiled in November at the 30th edition of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Québec also unveiled four short and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock market? Experts split the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the year and investors are already waiting for a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Bank Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets offer, at least in the short term, certain doubts."
These experts do not anticipate that the stock market will move in the last weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market is maintained by the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially solid income influenced by the effect of turnover in high-quality securities, both in long and short sections".
Therefore, they believe that the exchange will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "mainly because the impact of the likely fall in the Fed's (Federal Reserve System) rates is unknown, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives to inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for bold statements that a marathon will take place.
“There’s not much to be excited about,” the expert said.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an Intermoney analyst, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year a little closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional supplementary pension contributions that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, because he believes that the marathon will happen earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching technical levels and "therefore we could observe a reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US about the consequences of the crisis in the credit market".
The analyst believes that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on a selection of titles that will make sure to bring Ibex to the new maximum odds.
Solana of Intermoney confirms that "this year is the time for strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the growth will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich on this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been gaining ground for several months now and we hope that other construction companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclical consumption will be at the forefront in the last part of the year thanks to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that technology will also do very well, although in this field they are not very represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of declines on two occasions.
The real marathon took place at the end of the year in 2003, in the year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technology bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 regained 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see whether 2007 will be the fifth profitable year in a row (so far, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
The same goes for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided to take this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial for other entities to join this initiative, which supports opening hours of trades, or not.
This is precisely the goal of the project, which was set by the Popular Bank.
Gain individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where branches will be opened.
The Bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain within about 18 months, as this is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches it already has in the trading zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in individual streets.
This extension of the opening time is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more current design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, Chief Commercial Officer of <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, assures that the restructuring will not involve a large investment, but will involve more staff as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Bank Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branches were selected in the Madrid streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, and according to Rivera, it seemed to be a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specialised immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also have very long opening hours and are open even on Sundays and holidays.

For the first time on the stock market, Telecinco doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We did it.
With this sentence, yesterday Paolo Vasile, the executive chairman of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade, when he noted that the television he controls has doubled the value of his rival Antenna 3.
There was only one thing that spoiled his joy: “What I regret is that it didn’t happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,” he said.
And he stressed that due to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Yesterday, Telecinco stopped trading by a shift of 2.54 percent.
This profit shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The stock market value of this company, controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%), according to Bloomberg data, is EUR 4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5 percent since January, has a half-worth of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were valued is 3.571 billion in the Sogecable case, 2,518.53 million in Prisa (published by Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 billion in Vocento.
According to Vasile, a comparison with Antena 3 is offered, because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price, and how we will evaluate it in the audience."
Telecinco last week announced that it expects to become the first TV channel to surpass billions of gross advertising revenues this year, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, executive chairman of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the group’s advertising arm.
If the forecast were to be achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in advertising revenue of 3.6% this year, compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
In the first nine months of the year, Antenna 3’s net turnover increased by 1.6% (to 734.4 million), while Net TV’s net income increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay-out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, distributed 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that even though it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always reported much more.
This year I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who have already raised the value of 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at these times.
Lehman Brothers recently downgraded its Telecinco profit estimates to 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is due to the fact that they explain that the projected growth of revenues has stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenna 3's expected profit to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress Approves MiFID Transposition Effective November 1
In parallel with the parliamentary negotiations that were concluded today with a congressional vote on the amendments incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted to a public hearing a regulation that is developing the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
Members and senators’ efforts to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee investor protection and detailed regulation of the activities of the entities necessary for the efficient functioning of the markets were similarly highlighted by the representatives of the various parties.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialised firms and natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial services firm (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI) that joins securities companies, securities brokerage firms and portfolio management companies.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions with financial instruments is being expanded to include multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law also obliges firms providing investment services to disseminate information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of dealing with risk on the market, and requires the CNMV to keep a record of all operations carried out to simplify supervision.
During the debate in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which it stands out that the securitized receivables were considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was proven by what happened in the US with high-risk mortgage debts (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally define the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold 30 years after the Royal Decree was adopted in 1977, which sets out professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary that will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the European Union’s inflation index, provides preliminary information on how prices have developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication is in line with the policies of Eurostat and the Central European Bank (CEB) to provide data in time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This provisional indicator shall be calculated using the same process as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (Institute of State Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this provisional indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final figure that will become known on 14 December of this year.
"ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase of the ISC to 4.1% is a "temporary number", but also predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes in the sidelines of Congress specified that "even if it is not a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential to the monetary union over the past two years is still "more or less" the same.
He also explained that November was "less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of about 4%," the economy minister said of the data presented today.
Virgin Plans to Earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 Billion with Northern Rock in Three Years
Since Northern Rock entered the crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually fell over a two-and-a-half-month period of client mistrust, even though the government offered a 100% guarantee for that money and would extend it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the company’s name with Virgin Money, needs to raise about a quarter of the proceeds invested in British banks over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18bn to reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30bn.
The Richard Branson group, known in the UK for its striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked the Virgin consortium’s offer, which consists of three more companies, as one that would prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totana Arrested for Alleged Corruption in Construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcian town of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of this morning for his alleged involvement in corruption practices in construction that were exposed this week.
One of the town hall's secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the current MP and until then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER TV, could have been the "head" of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission, and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption practices in construction, which were revealed earlier this week, was charged.
As reported yesterday by Caden SER, the lawyer of the “people’s” MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales’ residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigators, the subject of the investigation is Morales' alleged collection of commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently being detained.
Bono accepted an offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, to preside over Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted an offer by Prime Minister and Socialist Secretary General José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to lead the next general election in the PSOE Candidate List in Toledo, and if the Socialists win the general election, he will become president.
This was announced at a press conference by PSOE Secretary for José Blanco and Bono himself, following a meeting with Zapatero at the party’s federal headquarters this afternoon.
The chief executive explained the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He also noted that "yes, it seems" that this La Mancha politician will be the Socialist Party's candidate for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as President of Congress, who on November 15 announced his decision not to run in the next general election and leave his active political career to fight climate change as part of university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the high-level politics he left two years ago.
He also said that just as citizens know who will be deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono wins the post, he hopes to turn the House into a “house of respect, not insults or screams” and achieve “more and more like the citizens.”
“Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is impossible to speak calmly and peacefully is Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate was interrupted 26 times on one occasion.”
In the same vein, he gave commendations to the current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, and "his good work" and did not want to introduce himself in his place, so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propagation
As the climate change movement is being relentlessly persecuted, both those who look sceptically at its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must show firm coherence.
Moreover, having a leader of a movement that is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have contributed significantly to Spain leading the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-compliance, in which sectors it happens and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to slow down climate change.
Which companies will be damaged by this, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, both individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences this will have.
In other words, who sacrifices themselves and who pays for saving the planet.
But we have not seen such explanations, nor will we see them.
This is because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures to combat climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening business and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party), seemed to Zapatero so risky in terms of elections that he hastened to refuse it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, pure propaganda, slogans that lack any real meaning.
Impressive phrases, committees, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this master is so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is an adornment of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it is limited to being just a virtual contractor and does not require us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany arrested on suspicion of corruption practices in construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcian city of Totana, the "people" of José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the city hall secretary and one businessman in the hospitality industry, on suspicion of committing crimes during the construction.
The mayor was arrested in his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now located, along with a number of police officers who also arrived at the Construction Commission and the Municipal Industrial Land and Apartment Management Company.
The three arrests added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation involving the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land on land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions during the previous election period, could build 4,000 houses.
In addition, two other people were not arrested, but are accused in a shortened procedure in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and today the member of the Autonomous Parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are being investigated.
The charges also included his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, as well as his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., the director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and entrepreneur from Vigo, was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., the director of Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were transferred.
The investigation is being carried out by a crime group in the construction of the Civil Guard Operational Central Unit, whose members, in addition to the arrests, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (province of Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was imprisoned in Totana at the time, in the area of a very well-known owner of a company for poultry meat products, who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Total, which was re-qualified and its project was to double the settlement of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which support the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela, and Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico Square in Vigo, Hogartel, which focuses on direct marketing and Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sales and construction.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18, the same day that the critic of Blackburn’s book accidentally appeared there:
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public debates in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it was not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague reports on the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a crime at a rate ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell records in the store for less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400, it is considered a mere misdemeanor (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you alienate up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty rate is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to exchange compacts.
To participate in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (Section 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered to be less serious under Section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable more than the provision of pornographic material to minors (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't mistaken, someone's hand has slipped away, and that's it.

My attending physician shoves me one of his articles on strange research titled “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.”
Or the feelings that are caused by the monthly salary of employees depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the group View Neurocognition at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague incorrectly."
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they were paid the same salary, activation was mild, but when one got doubled, activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been stalking Balkan war criminals for eight years from the prosecutor’s office in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which the title of the documentary film by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which, at the pace of a detective thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the persecution of escaped criminals and pressure on the relevant countries.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident, represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of driving license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insured.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive the agreed insurance amount in a certain amount for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insured event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of a driving licence, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that married people have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of rides and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in frequency of rides increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the cost of insurance premiums.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the kind of insurance that best corresponds to his profile of the insured.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to meeting the type of insured, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of 25 face various disadvantages, such as having little driving experience and short driving licenses, when they want to arrange insurance premiums at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most careful drivers can choose insurance against all risks with a premium discount to get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insured event.
“The part of the payment of the insured event that the client will provide will be determined in advance when determining the premium price, which will be the higher the lower the participation,” explains Luis Noguera, Chief Executive Officer of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance intermediary.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation so that the client insures against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, he would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under 25 years old, try to be attentive and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce insurance premiums in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
Malus, on the other hand, is an increase in the basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profit.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus,” Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, it is easier for drivers to get insurance, as the risk index of the client decreases, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to arrange insurance against all risks with a discount.
“Young people usually can’t take advantage of the lessons learned when an accident occurs, or even when driving,” assures the director of a European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the “fear of the newcomer” has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to arrange insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered by insurance companies as the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting from the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their driving is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” notes Luis Noguera.
Retirees are advised to have insurance against all risks with a premium discount (which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would be most suitable for us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to score on AC Milan point, which means eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will weigh their forces this Tuesday at the San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to reach their respective goals at the end of the Champions League, as it would mean for the Italians to be first and for the Scots it would decide on the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured the fifth game of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to be sure that Shakhtar will not get in front of him with six points, who will play with Benfica, which has four.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth round ends, as AC Milan has to play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will play for the first time in the thirteenth semi-final, in an effort to advance to the final, which is played on the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed before the others and a hesitant result at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems most likely, even if both teams try to compete for victory, because the Italians will not want to tact on home soil and Celtic knows that after the victory he would be first and would secure a better place in the eight-finals.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even be enough to progress if Shakhtyor does not win, but he can not rely on it, because with the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians, who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first direct match (2:0).
So AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe that they will get to the semi-finals for the second time in the reorganized Champions League, just as they defeated them in the same match in the previous competition by a goal Kaka in the extension (1:0) after the state of 0:0 in the basic playing time.
The hope that the "rossoneri" will win will be Shakhtar, for whom the victory is worth, only if Celtic loses, both for progress to the eight-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although the last one and unable to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one victory, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver was attended by 20,000 people
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 spectators since breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they began their concert at the GM Place stadium in Vancouver, their "groups" once again stated that "their"
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video depicting the group’s history, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tour takes place at the same time as the release of their new album, released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though a nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said about the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to disagreements between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed her nervousness at a meeting with journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world's public opinion had changed, the view of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said of the reunion of the group she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled down and we all love each other very much."
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So, at the beginning, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with a special Virgin Airlines.
On arrival at the airport, they were expected by the nanny's army.
The five have a total of seven children.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, which increases the risk that the Russian supply of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine, and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will be charged higher transit fees.
The previous dispute between the two countries reduced supplies to EU countries last year.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes as the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters.
"The changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine."
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a massive drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the EU’s gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of them remain under-exploited.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
The NHS “must check foreign employees”
The auditor said the Scottish chambers of the NHS must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor operating in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also fears that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was immediately interested in staff recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area following the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Bilal Abdullah, a 28-year-old Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone drove a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of linking to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK before their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland to check criminal records, the agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report by the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which help employers with checks in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out regularly," the report said.
Mr. Black said the Scottish NHS is largely in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but added: “Our report draws attention to areas where the system could be improved to ensure that accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel is available.”
Dr Peter Terry, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment controls in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities said they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher also because the commission had trouble identifying staff with residence permits.
The survey also found that NHS inspection procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely carried out.
These included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the pre-employment control policy and directive for foreign NHS workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this job immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the health commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated pre-employment control directives for all staff - including foreign staff - that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, garnered five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The award went to star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named Best Actress for the thriller The Notes of the Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig has been awarded a Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film - the soundtrack of which includes The Killers, David Bowie and The New Order - cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won the Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic cover of the album U2 Joshua Tree, two awards - for the best director and for the best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - as Julien Temple's film about Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the award for best actor for his role as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing tough guys, has won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth, and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the next installment of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud of the award, which is named after movie star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me," he added.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
Independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Supporters and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 People for Terrorist Conspiracy
Saudi Arabia says it has arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities, as well as spiritual and security forces.
The state television reported that one of the cells wanted to smuggle missiles into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have campaigned against the monarchy, allied to the United States, since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
A television reporter reported that an eight-militant cell led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil facility in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid reaction unit to defend the facility from a failed al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil refinery in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry as saying that the 18 arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launching expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smuggle eight missiles into the kingdom.
The 22 detainees were to prepare for the murders of clerics and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from going to Iraq in order to join al-Qaeda militants fighting with allied troops and the US-backed Shiite government, which conservative Sunni Saudis consider to be heretical.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
Militants — backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Saud Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government — have focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and power facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past... five months," an interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested to promote "Takfirian thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate on Venus may be a glimpse into Earth’s future.
Scientists say Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to the Earth's headless twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are roughly the same size and orbit similarly, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago on Venus, conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the fuzzy greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower rotation speeds sent Venus along a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and is ravaged by storms and hurricane-force winds.
The findings from the European Space Agency's Venus Express probe, which has been studying the planet for a year, offer a moderate view of how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different than on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which Venus began as Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police Detain 'Enriched Uranium'
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people had been detained and the material was being investigated.
He did not confirm it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still wide open
Mitt Romney said it was not dignified for presidential candidates to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates subsequently agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and handed them over for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions broadcast on Wednesday 28 November were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected a lot about the state of the Republican Party in the run-up to next year’s elections.
It is not clear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most important Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something pleasurable: the broadcaster recorded peaks of agreement when candidates spoke of a hard-line approach at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the nation's top candidate, and Mr Romney, who had made a breakthrough in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake up the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York City, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
The two fought particularly hard when questioners asked if any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Side candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, managed to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
None of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they started beating the immigration alert earlier and stronger than the others.
At least on immigration, the candidates have roughly the same opinion: more strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about toxic toys from China and other concerns with the outside world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the rift between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate began to be very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun ownership in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One interviewer asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani went so far as to say that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now at the forefront of a recent Iowa poll against all assumptions thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning him a laugh.
The fight remains extremely open.
Mr Huckabee's rise in Iowa coincides with the recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul's loud cheerfulness in Wednesday's debate.
The two have bounced from the bottom, as both wings of the party still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning report on American size on the lips, blinking on both wings of the party.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Labour Party's Pain
Gordon Brown once again found a trap he could fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although it is common in British political scandals, this one is not particularly spicy.
No orders seem to have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers were sucked.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would do without discovering that some wealthy businessman for four years had masked <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) in contributions to the ruling Labour Party under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by polls, there was hope that he would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being articulated by the increasingly amusing Liberal Democrat deputy chairman, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The clumsy rescue of the troubled Northern Rock Bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative delusions.
The three retired generals launched a riot in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, arguing that being commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now there are many gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of Labour (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is unavoidably heading towards his end.
In spite of this, governments can reach a tipping point where they find government difficult.
The people don't trust politicians and don't like them, but they usually put away their mistrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister probably won’t improve anything, and doesn’t even have to be in office for long, this push is gone: the state administration is becoming hollow, ministers are starting to brief, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defensive.
In one direction, Mr Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, unlike other political leaders, he cannot take the position of a new broom.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the records of the Treasury are related to the decisions that Mr. Brown made as Secretary of the Treasury.
And even though he was not directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as the lengthy investigation into the financing of political parties caused by “values for money,” voters can safely conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they seem.
They're not as bad as conservatives do.
As for Mr. Bean, no one died or was misled.
And the cure, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, solid, and easily brutal government.
The recent upheaval over political donations is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says that he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not up to him.
The laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has a right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew of Mr. Abrahams's actions but did not know that they were illegal, would certainly be thoroughly questioned; so would Jon Mendlesohn, the chief labor money-seeker, who learned of the savage gifts in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved at all; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these tangles, although the bulk of the payments did not take place until after his arrival in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the law by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as finding the permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of the financing of political parties.
That would require the Labours, who are in a tight spot, to cooperate with the Conservatives, and perhaps even to relinquish their special financial relationship with the trade unions—the bitter pill for a devoted party member like Mr. Brown.
But he should face some simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is unquestionable integrity and high competence.
Card Sharks
Does the Mortgage Crisis Affect the U.S. Credit Card Market?
When there is blood in the water, the spinal fins naturally begin to blink excitedly around.
As the U.S. real estate market slumps, predators have turned their attention to the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer loan options were contaminated by underprivileged mortgages.
The signs of tension are clear.
There is an increasing number of inability to repay (with more than 30 days of late payment) and debited accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market - also due to insolvency credit card loans.
But it is too early to panic.
Unpaid bills and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody’s, the 3.89 percent insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost a full percentage point below average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The 2005 change in U.S. personal bankruptcy laws led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies, which account for a large proportion of credit card losses; thus, the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would rise regardless of whether the general conditions for borrowers have deteriorated.
The industry also shows a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is solid, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Mr. Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct routes for the spread of infection between the crisis of subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: when real estate loans dry up, consumers are more likely to get in debt through credit cards.
Credit card issuers, however, look at the cash flow rather than the values of the guarantee items, so falling house prices do not necessarily mean a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They can even be beneficial for lenders.
Consumers’ motivation to pay off mortgages declines as the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up the priority list for repayment.
Card issuers can also respond faster and more flexibly to more turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the prices of guarantor items.
“It’s not going to happen that one beautiful morning we’re just going to rethink all of our loans,” said Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of inferior mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is much more real.
If lower home prices and debt reduction push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in the fraud linked to former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday changed their statement and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial of U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, has been featured on the front pages for two years, which has taken the issuing process.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron crash.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the collapse of Enron.
The indictment of the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to plot the fraud together with Fastow and his former chief aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in Enron’s Fastow-controlled affiliate, which was the architect of many Enron scams that pushed Enron down the spiral to declare bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch as zero, but our three Brits knew it was in fact of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in the branch for $1 million.
The incriminated bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in the Greenwich NatWest subsidiary.
But the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received 7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about 12.3 million dollars.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons moved on bail for $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for an upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company in the country, collapsed in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks made it no longer possible to hide billions in debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The crash cut thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s downfall.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were removed after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-powerlessness
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with enough fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $ 54 million.
For some of the rich in Russia, however, this is a small return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a small family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer sat at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaires' Show, a four-day orgy of spectacular consumption in a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers built their stalls, hoping that the newly-rich Russians would lure everything from mahogany-loaded yachts to diamond-decorated car counters that 50 Cent wouldn’t be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the next booth.
"It's a nice car, but it's a penny and a dime against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money pours into the Russian capital just like it did when Dallas had his days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became enormously rich and traveled to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year student at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi spenders of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry brought together Donatello Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets like the Russian one.
(The conference is organized by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to Forbes magazine’s list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a combined fortune of $282 billion.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local major institute, published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "second-rate" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London's jewellery retailer, David Morris.
She was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are well-groomed, and men are all for a fortune."
As they walked through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovcova, five years older than her, described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at these cars and I can’t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Ms. Yumatova, who wore branded clothes like a red carpet veteran, next to whom Joan Rivers looks like a housewife.
The fair seemed to be aimed primarily at fresh rich people, brand-driven Russian buyers who are willing to sit for a few hours in the road to walk around the warehouse, which is shoutingly stirring Cadillacy Escalade, platinum fish, Mövenpick ice cream, custom-made billiard tables, plinths in the apartment.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
“Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain maker Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt’s hand-painted blue tiles in their overlife size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in the gilding."
And indeed, local sellers say that Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known limited edition brands that would never appear at a shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, ambassadors of millionaires or ordinary tourists, flooded the fair halls every day.
Some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two mattress sets of silk, cashmere and cotton, woven with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
On the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which customizes luxury cars, said he sold three car grilles in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantom at $55,000.
He showed the reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner that had a string coated with Swarovski crystals that looked like roulette.
Price: $22,000 for four of these.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconia doesn’t have to ride those wheels yet,” Karapetian said.
"They'll put it in their garage with 30 to 40 cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" currently means nothing very exclusive, given the large increase in prices of local real estate.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at the stand run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four red British-style phone booths filled with columns of fake $1 million bills.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
Passers-by stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let their friends take a cell phone picture of them resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply to fill their pockets with a few million dollars.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey Could Be Caused by Failed Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the local restaurant a little healthier and watched an ambulance arrive at a white New England house two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon the police patrol car joined in.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the delivery of the coroner," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, executive assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died from a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at the 212 West Scott Avenue building.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, and they hope toxicology tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of grief to the Newark Police Department.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the Police Director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough, and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said of Miss Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
It would protect me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons, aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, spokeswoman for the Union District Attorney, Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroyo died from unlicensed surgery.
"It's one option," Miss Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at around 3 p.m.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro's house, with a spoiled rose bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the basement, there was a blue barrel in the open garage with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived in New York City after 25 years in the Newark Police Department, Miss Arroyo had provided him with invaluable assistance in biting through the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful of this or that,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The Fed’s hope of lowering interest rates leads to stronger global exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm borrowing conditions by further lowering interest rates were reinforced by reassuring statements by the Vice President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock market surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line to Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that in response to continuing pressure on financial markets, managers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
In an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid signs of reviving credit efforts, Mr Kohn said the recent upheavals "have partially reversed some of the improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and in October".
He also said that if the increased instability persists, there will be a greater chance that the financial conditions of households and businesses will deteriorate further.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver more fresh capital to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
The remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when home sales in October were at record lows.
The effects of the financial whirlwind were highlighted by an announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, 4% of its global workforce, as part of cost cuts to offset heavy losses caused by a failed bet on subprime housing loans in America.
Only 20 of these locations are expected to be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial index rose by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
The London-based FTSE 100 index rose by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, to 6,306.2 points, while the value of British blue-chips rose by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6 percent and France’s CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets appeared to be in full force after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash packages were auctioned to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release excess money on London’s money markets has increased as the rates of the three-month British interbank loans “Libor” rose after a steady growth from 12 November to their maximum from the end of September – 6.59 percent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context, no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the picking committee, who holds the position at its best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the full captain, with decision-making help, and because Hugh Morris, the head manager of the English team, is starting to fill the table with applications for the non-national picking.
He who is not built in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It’s not easy to find what gets one at the top of his profession, while someone else never gets over the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in cricket that choice is difficult and requires an opinion that must always be subjective in the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say that here, John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and industry insight, should be promoted to commission - there's only room for one.
Who is to say which level is right for cricketers when they don’t have a chance to fall or swim to the next one?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain's view at the right time if he is to take the wicket, and the batter needs regular chances in starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the collector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better ones, which James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets at 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next one.
Whether he plays at Asgiriya Shah Stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or finish the career of both, or it also may not have much impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class he performed well, five wickets and 40 vacation runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time fought for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, which is in addition, although in Australia against Australia, he may have scored a hundred points.
Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores are more likely to follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah's greater experience over Bopar's youthful prowess after another discussion following today's training at Asirgiya Stadium.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test Shifts at 88 points in Mumbai and 32 cents in first class versus the six Bopars, who, at the age of twenty-two, is seven years younger and has excellent stats against spins.
However, Shah made only ten runs in two shifts in May against the Caribbean at the Lord's Test, his home field in Middlesex, and this, along with the immediate rejection of the collectors, when Vaughan wanted to retake him for the next match, his firing seemed to have taken away something from the vibe that was so in Bombay.
In contrast, the Essex universal has joie de vivre in its bones.
Nothing scares him on the cricket pitch, and his behavior outside the pitch symbolizes a recently overturned four-wheel drive car on the exhibition day of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He escaped with minor injuries and perhaps shock, but first he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his teammate who was watching from a distance, to ask excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, its medium-speed skids on the local pitches, which seem to suit him, distributes effectively and launches confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that's the real art of choice.
Personally, I'd like Bopara to get his chance now, but I don't want to say that Shah won't excel if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he's the one to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday to dump refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some even returned to fight the militants who had driven them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was full of refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of dozens of buses.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shia militia of militant cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, an 38-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni Amariah region, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shia neighbors in Amariah called him saying that the local militia, with the support of the U.S. military, had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe that was expelled from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“On the day before yesterday, a few friends called me and told me that they were launching an al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62, said.
Many have spoken about the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the US military presence and the growth of local “groups of biased citizens” who, with arms in hand, side by side with the US military, defend their quarters.
But more was said to have been driven back by visa obstruction and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced suspicions shared among refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force them back.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian assassins.
“Everything was fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and pressured the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to return to Iraq,” he said.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of violence is the fact that Sunnis were pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will once again inflame sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Saarland, good education
Germany’s smallest state plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In only one area of education, Saarland is concerned about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who does not come from Saarland, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Saarland on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saar education system, which ranks fifth in monitoring the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
To this day, students can complete their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saric children are admitted to college - many of them even without a high school diploma.
“In Saarland, a professional education system is used,” says Axel Plünnecke, an IW education expert.
With more than one out of every five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, Saarland has a wealth of opportunities to combine practical and academic education.
The possibilities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany given the population.
Despite practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
Therefore, the saarian education ministry has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for engineering.
"After the first study of Pisa, we have implemented several reforms in general education schools," a spokesman for the Ministry of Education said.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that other federal countries take over.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 % to 20 %.
In general, however, Saarland did not improve as much as other federal countries.
The Bavarians are better at counting.
And to Saar's disappointment, the Pisa study does not compare foreign language skills - otherwise Saar could score in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in grammar schools - even though the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez moves the clock
The clocks in Venezuela will be different than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will allow the clock to shift back by half an hour in this South American country.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has become a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that under the new law, the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, an enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing on the world the division of time zones for hours.
On Wednesday, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced that he was breaking off relations with neighboring Colombia because of the hostages.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-respect anymore," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in a Sunday referendum.
With this reform, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
Uribe's decision to revoke Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia to release the hostages sparked controversy.
Uribe's decision to spit in Venezuela's face, he criticised Uribe Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez on Sunday.
In Spain, too, everyone is talking about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
The new mobile ringtone has caused a stir here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you no longer silent?) - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was so annoyed by the loud remarks of this left-wing populist that he silenced him in this way.
Germany faces lower salaries in 2007
According to the forecast, this year German employees are threatened with a reduction in real wages, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic forecast for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can realistically expect to receive a lower salary than last year.
“It is a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in prices for food and energy,” Gustav Horn of the Institute for Makroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung (IMK) told Bild daily.
New burdens on employees may also await in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that by the new year the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% is correct and reasonable in this situation.
The Federal Labour Agency, however, should no longer fall into such difficulties that it would have to demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspaper quoted the Social Democratic politician as saying.
On Tuesday, it was reported that the price explosion of food and oil products drove inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices increased by 3% overall.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its life-threatening atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European Venus Express spacecraft on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and winds at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that Venus is flashing.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to the famous theory of the origin of primordial matter, life could have been created on Earth by lightning. Storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the cornerstones of life.
It wasn’t like that on Venus: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than the Earth’s, and sometimes temperatures are around 500 °C.
"Out there, maybe, it's the Earth's hell twin, but it's the Earth's twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in size and mass to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way, is a fundamental question of the Esa mission.
Since no spacecraft had been sent to study Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of Venus Express in November 2005 was a milestone in the exploration of the planet.
According to scientists, the latest results of research, which brought several articles of the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," Esa said.
In addition to the already known wind swirls at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud swirl at the South Pole, which spins significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth's northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is almost the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km is almost the same size.
This planet, known as Morning Star or Evening Star, will orbit the Sun in nearly 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus has a surface temperature of 460°C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists believe that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water had accumulated on both of them, but it remained on Earth in the oceans while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler has called for an end to party disputes over the admission of the Dalai Lama to the chancellor's office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler worries about Germany’s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the dispute over the Dalai Lama’s admission.
"We should not present ourselves externally as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights have universal validity for me," Köhler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent him from standing up for Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy against China.
"The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his opposition to the admission of the Dalai Lama and was attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition’s “predictive” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel an invitation from German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but it also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries, according to SPIEGEL.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama’s acceptance was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept a Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed the position of China.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas also located in China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar unrest in France
Street battles with the police, gunfire, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that broke out in France.
We must do everything to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not grow into violence on the street, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
The barricades were on fire, gunmen were firing shots at the police, and after severe riots among young people in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
“We have to be careful not to create such social tensions in our country, which will break out in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he told the Hannoveran newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to fix the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
“From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we have had our first successes.”
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs were not comparable to those of France.
In recent nights, teenagers and police have been fighting hard in the northern suburbs of Paris.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts of the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In light of the riots in France, Kolat warned of an "imitating effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
However, there should still be action.
Kolat pointed out that among people under 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "excessively high".
First of all, it is necessary to provide a greater number of study opportunities.
Colat stressed: "We must give the young people hope."
The head of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is more social control of families.
Moreover, many migrant youths do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Colat said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to “swiftly allow young people to start working and learning.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police were deployed, and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorities have reported three arrests and several lit garbage cans and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 deployed law enforcement forces have been taking care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
About 80 police officers were injured in the riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots of Toulouse swept over.
Sunday's car accident caused a riot, in which two teenagers lost their lives.
According to the initial findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police bear no responsibility for the death of minors.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The chancellor’s remote exit documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can no longer expect anything more from her.
In which country does the Chancellor live?
After her disappointing, indifferent and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Bundestag, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should ultimately govern.
To the remorse of focusing too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded with a very arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she didn’t want to understand what the critics were up to.
In the Federal Assembly, she visibly demonstrated to everyone how much she deserved to be reproached.
There was no real interest in Merkel, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who stands out above others, who flees to foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the summit in Heiligendamm, but it no longer says how these climate goals are to be achieved in Germany.
And at all, such bragging - so much immodesty would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now it is limited to vain phrases that could increase its popularity among people.
This approach damages the image of a pragmatist who does not need flattery because she solves problems.
But in Angela's "Cloud" realm, internal political issues are marginal.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
There are a few additional sentences left on these topics.
It’s worth noting how often Merkel is overheard when it comes to child allowances.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times in order to be able to say at least a partially correct sentence.
As soon as things become too concrete, they stumble like in a completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate over Republican presidential nominees on YouTube in the case of favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney has erupted into a heated debate – and both now have to worry about an outsider nominee.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident on the first topic.
Mitt Romney tells his rival, Rudy Guiliani, that he has made New York "a haven for illegal immigrants".
Giuliani quickly responds with harsh remorse: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," responds and warns the former Massachusetts governor that he was privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Since the Republican base still has no clear favorite, the eight presidential candidates use these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
The half-minute videos uploaded and recorded by Internet users via YouTube serve only as such help on a key topic.
“It is precisely this kind of isolationist policy that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” John McCain warns his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam veteran McCain hasn’t spared Romney for refusing to condemn a tortured interrogation method called “Waterboarding” that simulates heating.
Reactions from the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, show that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are important themes of the campaign.
The audience bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explains in a twisted way, asking the party's base and the television audience for forgiveness for being an abortion advocate back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf for the first time in civilian life
A day after his resignation from the post of commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parviz Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for the next five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place in the presidential palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his position as commander-in-chief to his confidant, Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, a former general rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation from the post of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to Senior Prosecutor Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharraf will lift the state of emergency soon after his oath to meet other demands from the West.
The country's highest court, which seized his favored lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
In the meantime, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal region of North Vaziristan and four others were injured.
A military spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The fathers of Krautrock are back.
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the group Harmonia have again grabbed their electronic synthesizers at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At that time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then lies in the performance of three sedentary gentlemen, who at first seem to just enjoy dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and buttons in front of them.
Dieter Moebius, 63, in a snow-white shirt, sits in the middle.
On his left is Michael Rother, 75, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Hans-Joachim Roedelius, a 37-year-old who leans over the synthesizers, is on the right from the viewers’ point of view.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, a traditional composition will be created from them.
That doesn’t seem to bother the musicians much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable excitement.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, but it is certainly not well-trained enough for this band to be painfully missed for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t a German celebrate his still-living legends of the 1970s?
And especially when the music style, erroneously called krautrock, is more valued in England and America than in their own country.
In 2003, when the music business awarded the surviving members of the Cologne-based band Can the Echo for Lifetime Achievement Award, the hall was filled with questioning views from German pop fans.
Moreover, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew the borders.
Michael Rother later sat with them on stage at Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of the Berlin Schaubühne Theatre.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a turntable company run by the church.
Rother briefly helped with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist with Neu!, which at the time was perhaps the most radical German band.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of the band Cluster into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a ruin from the 16th century, they lived as members of a commune who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to work as a nanny.
It was more of a life in such a Spitzweg artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in a trash can.
A lot of that Harmony has preserved.
The first album was titled "Music from Harmony" followed by "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered financial difficulties.
Gathering grits did not serve only self-knowledge.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" is said to have been cut in front of a record-breaking, barely 50-piece set.
Rothera then expressed a wish for the members of Harmony to snuggle in and exercise occasionally.
For Roedli and Moebi, it was a completely indecent request.
In 1975, the band announced their breakup.
Rother ended up in the esoteric realm and secured his future with the album Burning Heart.
Cluster resurrected in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia ever was.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His record label Grönland set out to preserve krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place at the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
There will be a Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also take part.
In this way, we mapped out the overall breadth of the influence of krautrock on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's theorem, accompanied by the strangest sounds, is floating in the hall: "Unique true music, the future belongs to it."
There are paintings in which the producer with Harmonia is in the peasant session.
To create the legend also contributes to the projection of other black and white photos, on which the set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were again employed by improvisation.
Not by gluing microphones to organ and drums to extract those never-before-heard self-made tones from instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the technique of dodging the pointers.
The House of World Cultures hasn’t changed that either.
Under the guidance of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds, and in one beautiful place she sings emphatically "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find our roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in the escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not let himself be carried away.
Even the most obvious thing on the scene is carefully thought out.
Where does music begin and when does it end?
This question will either deprive a person of his nerves or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is just not cynical enough.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Mörderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them is convincing.
The template of the films either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop him at The Hunting Party.
Good news first: War criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but right there, in the bleak backdrop of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Lately, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played in many appealing, frivolous roles in comfortable women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences on the theme of Buddhism, one will take the appetite for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument to watch The Hunting Party – Where the Hunter Becomes the Prey (Why do movie titles have to be so long and confusing these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry weren’t so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but still retains a remarkable charm as a ruinous monument.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Mörderischer Frieden, which is also coming to the cinema this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Mörderischer Frieden we can make a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, then one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television shallow film turns too soon into shooting and action.
The film will be a lot like the Cobra 11 series, though without a highway, but with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, you can clearly see why the Balkan War has not yet been made a really good film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters posing as a "fox", a Serbian war criminal, could at other times and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here's Richard Shepard) become the new "Apocalypse".
After all, the two stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go into the woods to do something the army is unable to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the sloppy and sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the draft will also prescribe a romantic affair with the later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters in the world have failed to do in the last five minutes of the film: catch the criminal and leave it to the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so against the logic of filmmaking that it would be worthwhile to turn to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profoundly human message.
It denounces the fact that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (they are exceptionally united here) that they are not pursuing persecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar, women think of Brecht's famous poem.
In it, it is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer’s desk: “With compassion I look at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting: how hard it is to be evil.”
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly such swollen heads, which, however, indicate how hard it is to be good.
This issue is not limited to the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was written in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big failures.
One thing to add to that is that no good South African film has ever been made.
Almost always: When a star wanders through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Boundaries of Breaking with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCaprio will be made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust – Schindler’s List.
Many of the films must probably have matured - the films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Leaden Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers don’t have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he has to form a sarcastic artistic outlook as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
Asked about the parallels between his historical novel Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary and the Balkan War, he said: "The only thing that resembles it is that some things never change.
“Great cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust Reaps Criticism for Refusing the Olympics
The mayor’s resignation from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come under fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in estimating chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, called the decision "unfortunate from the point of view of business".
No other project in recent times has given the city as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury the project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday for his earlier testimony that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Federation will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on Munich’s candidacy for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 timetable.”
Yet this dream has not yet ended, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's remarks regrettable.
It gives the impression that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy our chances by calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Refusing to apply would be contrary to the testimony of the head of the Senate, which he made at the general meeting of the General German Higher Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiade as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The university sports federation Hamburg has only nominated for the candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate has accused it of wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
“The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on hosting the Olympics and has ruled out building apartments,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, SPD MPs.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics, with the whole area being used for residential purposes later, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
The bidding for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, crashed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The one who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently made in Sweden cast dark shadows on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of his list of the ninety-four "Brillo Boxes" of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of the international market as well as of Warhol's 1968 "Brillo Boxes", the internal research of the Moderna Museet Museum in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo Boxes", which in 1995 to the Museum of Moderna Museet were donated by his former director Hultus
Previous events are a tangled, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-and-white design of the paper boxes of Brillo soap powder.
An exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their designs, mere exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to produce several wooden Brillo boxes in Sweden, but they are not on display in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time are now talking about fifteen boxes, which at that time rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Box" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum, Pontus Hultén, later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred crates were produced and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén cases were produced in Malmö for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
By this time Warhol was three years after his death.
Lars Byström, the chief conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored, in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood plates were painted in base paint and trimmed, they were brushed on a brush.
On the contrary, it turned out from the structure of the 1990 copies that the paint was applied with a paint roll directly on the plywood board without previous primer - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oil paint.
“These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol’s official Brillo Boxes list,” said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: “If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York doesn’t come to other conclusions, Moderna Museet will have to classify six boxes from its exhibition collections as ‘buildings’.
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these “major allegations” raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization remains in unrelenting silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila give up
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, fortifying themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Rebel commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he denied responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He used the negotiations to escape with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government's loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We encourage people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite unit Scout Rangers, said that other military units will join the march in the near future.
Critics of the government have called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
The government has been accused of corruption for months.
In 2003, the Manila financial region became the main site of a rebellion of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempts to overthrow a democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than 20 percent of its stake in Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company announced that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of the share capital.
Previously, there had been speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to speed up the consolidation of the German DSL market.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by another 5% to 15.1%, there were conjectures of entry on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had almost a 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were acquired by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesman said.
In order to take over the competing Freenet company, the companies together set up the SME Joint Undertaking.
On Thursday, United Internet announced that both companies would settle for a stake of more than 10% in Freenet and would not use their right to take over another 18.49 percent of the company.
It is considered that, for the time being, the companies retain all possibilities, in particular the possibility to further increase their shareholding in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contracted mobile network customers and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
The United Internet and Drillische holding has so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would acquire an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
