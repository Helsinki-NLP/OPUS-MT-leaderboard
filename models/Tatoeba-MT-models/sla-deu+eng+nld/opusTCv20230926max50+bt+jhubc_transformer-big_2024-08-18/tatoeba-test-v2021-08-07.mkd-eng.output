I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn’t eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like wine.
I really like your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I love to learn French.
It'd be really nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize the tipon.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the Queen.
I despise his rude attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I rinsed one.
Iron is stronger than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring it.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
Agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is there anything missing?
Last night I saw a ghost.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
How far is Boston?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
Are the potatoes calorie-free?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is it all there?
Is he breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I nodded my head.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more cultured.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Are you cold outside?
Is it done?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really very slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to leave?
Is it true?
I put a slap in his face.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a dead man.
I slept in the boat.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich upside down.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn’t that excessive?
Isn’t that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I guessed something strange.
Is that all Tom's doing?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Does that word even exist?
Is it necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Do you pay for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this the place?
Is it really a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this true in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is that your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this a free place?
Was that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still don’t believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don’t understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still love the horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom contribute?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Are you looking for Tom?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did you talk to Tom?
Is Tom there alone?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dungeon.
I'm studying art history.
I suddenly felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm glad you're leaning.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
I doubted it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch you burning and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I'm sweating every day.
Do you still have the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
All of this makes sense.
It seems aimless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
It's you for now.
It was so much more than I expected.
Never, but never, could have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get any better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
I'm in the middle of it.
That gave me an idea.
I've got a lot to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's getting cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I'm cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop it from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go out and eat.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a nice statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French very well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time for you to leave now.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's crazy.
I think it's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's wonderful.
I think Tom's cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's mean.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's petty.
I think Tom's a nut.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's tough.
I think Tom's vanity.
I think Tom's smart.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've been living in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think it's helped enough.
I've been thinking about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I never thought I'd find him.
I never thought I'd find Tom.
I thought it was caused to me.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where she put Mary's key.
I thought Tom might not want to come with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to come with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I wanted to visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
Didn't you love the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you lost your wristwatch.
Well, don't you hate him?
He seemed tired to me.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls who were inferior to you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you could swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts terribly here.
Mary is annoyed when Tom leaves the lid of the cup raised.
It's a multi-stage process.
It depends on whether you buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I can get the job done in one day.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It doesn't come to mind.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems wrong to me somehow.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be Christmas soon.
It will be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
He looked terrible.
It looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
Seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much yesterday, I got a headache, I'm really hungover.
Looks like these two are reunited.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He healed me.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It could rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have been amazed.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it'd be hard to get out.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I'm out.
I came back by bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn’t sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It probably won't be worth the wait.
It rained two days ago.
It resulted in great difficulty.
I tried to explain it to him, but he didn't snap.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend that I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you are taking the medication prescribed to you.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
Now it's all over.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to leave soon.
It's a lot of fun.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined it.
It is about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
It's a false mark.
It's a risky plan.
It's a pity the concrete doesn't burn.
It's quick to walk.
It's a simple matter.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They dismantled him.
It's just maquis.
It's been raining for a week or so.
Three weeks have passed since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely warm.
It's best if you don't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It is better to be optimistic and deceive yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
The sauna is here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to close.
Cold here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
Definitely they are.
Definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to assess his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to go to jail than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
That seems to be the only possible conclusion.
Looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to swear.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That’s exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
He's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's getting dressed.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be beastly.
It'll get even colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good.
It's improved.
It's so much fun.
It happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take too long.
I care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
It's in excellent condition.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
The simple question is where.
It's just made up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like this.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
It didn't happen that way.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
It's not hard to stand out when you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds really good.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's all white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
It's probably still there.
It's probably still available.
It's a hole.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really nasty.
It's a real pity.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious that we don't need evidence.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not working.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy foods like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was flat like a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
Thunder out there, I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
It's really cool.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
He can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom right away.
It's very relaxing.
It's too simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
I'm guessing.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You lose.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
I turned on the fan and pointed it at the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned it down, Tom.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was embarrassing.
It was after midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a chore that I spent the evening with a smart, funny and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
This behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was all night.
It was getting dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice present.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been shown that fleas that live on dogs jump higher than those that live on cats.
It was magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was blowing a lot.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that's attached to the chimney.
It was Tom.
It wasn't enough.
It was pathetic.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was inconceivable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Lies won't help.
That's not gonna help you.
It's working fine.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you explaining everything.
I need you urgently.
I used to watch you.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed.
I've already read it.
I’ve already written everything that needs to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone has always helped me.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I’ve always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little stressed out about something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for a home.
It was much worse for me.
I've been betrayed.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been ringing for hours.
I was sloppy.
I was reckless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I was gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
They hired me to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I have lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him for a while.
I've been pretty busy.
I've been looking for you for a while.
I have been learning French since I was 13 years old.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've seen it before.
I came for them.

We're being childish.
We're underrated.
They're cheating on us.
We're paranoid.
We're both from Boston.
We're busy now.
We're investigating the entire area.
We're worried about him.
We're worried about them.
We're done talking.
We eat apples.
We're messing with her.
We're messing with him.

Were there any survivors?
We're Tom's parents.
We're trying to help him.
We'll turn back.
We're very efficient.
We're very pleased.
We're wasting time.
We are dependent on work.
Are you scared?
Were you home at 10:00?
Was he one of them?
We're your neighbors.
Were you sincere?
Was he sympathetic?
Did you watch?
Were you with anyone?
We wrapped the carpet.
We sat and waited.
We should ask him.

We both have to go.
We should do this again sometime.

We should give Tom a chance to confess.
We should go home.
We need to help them.
We should let Tom get back to work.
We shouldn't have let her go.
We shouldn't have stayed up until 2:30.
We need to set a trap.
We were supposed to buy another bottle of wine.
We should've given up sooner.
We slept in a tent.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
We started talking.
We're in.
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
We still need a plan.
We still want to help.
We stole it.
We talked for two hours.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
We tried to get them to come.
We tried to get them to tell us.
We tried to hide it.

We value our customers.
None of us were right.
We've all read that.
We've already cleared that up.
We baked them cakes.
We just started.
We're expecting her.

They deceived us.
We've been trying.
We've been waiting.
We took care of it.

We went to pick strawberries.
We went to the same church.
We all cheered for her.
We were all shocked.
We were both busy.
We didn't even have any broken money.
We were completely confused.
We were 18 years old then.
We'd hang them.
We had a fight.
We were in a hurry.
We arrived just in time.
We just got out of there.
We've been looking for you.
We didn't fight.
We weren't hungry.
There were so many more of them than we did.
We were passengers.
We played golf.
We were ready.
We were very close.
Don't save the bell.

We were the first to arrive.
We were under attack.
We were worried about you.
We will discuss the forecast.

You'd better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would have done the same in my place.
You did a bad job.
You did a great job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was a fag?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
You told Tom about that, right?
You've already done it.
He did his best.
You don’t have to like everything.
You don't even like fish.
It made you sick, didn't it?
Do you happen to have a key?
You don't know how long.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
You know my shit.
You don't know anything.
Dream that you know.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You don't have to be present for this.
You don't have to go.
There's no need to panic.
You don't have to wear anything ugly.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
You don't know business.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're not really big enough to be here.
You don't want to go, do you?
You don't work here.
You're driving me crazy.
You forgot your backpack!
You scared Tom.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
You have the right to a phone call.
You go get Tom and come back.
You hit one.
You're wrong, people.
You guys were right.
Your hair's a mess.
You hate us, don't you?
You've got a great job.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
You have a habit that I don't like.
You have small breasts.
You have beautiful lips.
You were a great mentor to me.
You've been busy.
You have lovely eyes.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
I pay my respects.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
There's no reason to be afraid.
You're not premeditated, are you?
You've never seen one like that, have you?
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
You have a really good handwriting.
Your hands are soft.
You have to answer the question.
You have to ask them first.
You have to buy them a present.
You have to go home.
You have to help him.
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
You have to resign.
You have to sit down.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
You can't lose your fitness.
You have to try, Tom.
You've got a lot of beautiful lips.
You've got a lot of penetrating eyes.
You just heard.
He just got back from vacation.
You almost missed it.
You almost missed Tom.
You stay out of this.
Kids, you're here to stay.
You knew, didn't you?
You know I would do anything for your red eyes.
You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a fast learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
He left me in despair.
You let Tom get away.
You want your life, don't you?
You'll be fine.
You'll be confused.
You'll be in danger.
You'll be my guests.
You'll be notified in time.
You'll feel better.
You'll get a copy.
You'll feel better.
You'll get them back.
You're gonna get wrinkles.
You'll try, won't you?
You'll come with me and stop!
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
You're going to have to study for the better next year.
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
You'll need a ticket to travel by bus.
You're gonna have to sit still.
You'll never find her.

You're troubling me.
You might be needed.
You can go anywhere.

I need you to help me find him.
You need to hurry.
You need to make this work.
You haven't asked why.
He didn't give us a chance.
We only have one life.
One is life.
You need to create a habit of brushing your teeth after each meal.
You should go to the dentist.
You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You made a good choice.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
It's gone red.
He ran as fast as he could.
You're burning the car.
You're burning the car.
Your complaints have upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.
Your demands are unreasonable.

You won't find us.
You're below her level.
You're below his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?
You're not that terrible.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
You're not that old, Tom.

The eyebrows look strange to you.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
Your health is very important to me, why don't you go see a doctor?
Your house is very beautiful.

You seem to already know the answer.

You've made Tom miserable.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
He was lucky to survive the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not that you were wrong.
Tom was right.
He was driving fast.
You were great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
He was very brave.
