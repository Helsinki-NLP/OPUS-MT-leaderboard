Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they are “muppets-like”
Some members of the assembly are appalled by the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly throughout the political spectrum are concerned that they will laugh.
A member of the Labour Assembly said they were concerned in their group “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means poop.
A member of the assembly from the Plaid Cymru party said that their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Welsh conservative said his group was “open-minded” about the name change, but warned that there was little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a draft legislation to present the name changes, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will of course have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly was empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The Commission chose the name “Welsh Parliament Member” or “WMP” as members of the Assembly, but the most popular option was “MWP” in the public consultation.
Obviously, members of the Assembly are proposing other options, but reaching consensus will be a difficult task for presiding official Elin Jones, who has to submit a draft of legislation on amendments within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the exercise of the functions of members of the Assembly and the establishment of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on the legislation in the final vote on their name.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its application to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as churches in Harlem are struggling
“The older people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing differently today.
Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people regularly go.”
In the churches, however, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as the leaders expect, and that they will soon be back to the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with a common administration (condominium), where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will soon come when all these churches will close, as it is unlikely that the people who will move to these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white religious communities before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist church community emigrated in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community that performed worship nearby.
St. Martin’s was taken over by a black religious community led by the venerable John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of vendors on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who refused to hire or support blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson were planning a renovation, they ordered bells to ring.
The venerable David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the bells “the bells for the poor.”
The expert, who joined in July, referred to them in a slightly different way: “cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he bells larger bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he had not been replaced in St. Martin’s Church.
In the past few months, St. Martin’s Church has had a complex story with architects and contractors; some have been brought by church laymen and others by the diocese.
The sacristy – the administrative body of the parish, composed of laymen – wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese would “try to transfer the costs” to the parish, although the parish was not involved in the recruitment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the transparency of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injures 13-Year-Old While Hunting Lobster in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old while hunting lobster during the opening of the lobster hunting season in California on Saturday.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, and then he and the group swam to him and helped pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just thrilled to catch the lobster, and then he realized he was screaming, “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
When he reached the boy, Hammel noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
A rescuer from the water, Capt. Larry Giles, said in a press statement that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
For 48 hours, the authorities blocked access from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty spots like they have in the department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of its <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion entry into the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as clothing and home apparel sales decline, major beauty spots will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and in more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were previously used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty product portfolio to 3,000 and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also gain more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique range of cosmetics, so most products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
Fragrance Shop will also test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for smaller amounts of food in local stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to supermarkets as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discounts with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has opened Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as Habitat stores, since it bought both chains two years ago, boosting food sales and making acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended unsuccessfully.
Sainsbury’s embarked on a joint venture with the Boots chain in the early 21st century, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the sharing of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds said it will play a role in the plan as it expands its range of luxury skincare brands across four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty spots to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all your needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
The star of the show Dragons Day (Good Deal) is furious that TV host Holly Willoughby has pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their Truly clothing and accessories brand.
The company of the business couple was compared with the brand Goop Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that she's retiring.
Holly Willoughby angered the star of Peter Jones’ Dragons Day show as she pulled out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “furious” when a golden TV girl admitted on Tuesday during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she no longer had enough time to devote to their clothing and accessories brand Truly because of her new business worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and predicted that it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source states: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would survive for the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw completely stunned all those involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of show host This Morning, which is among the most interesting associations for banks in Britain, the company would cost millions due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been good friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The couple are on holiday together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
A difficult conversation “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism of the media about the comments, which some consider “non-presidential”, and the positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, in a mocking “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting. Their first meeting in Singapore in June, Trump described as a major step towards nuclear disarmament of North Korea.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "appropriate response" from the United States to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing to impose sanctions that will continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — stopping missile tests, helping to free hostages, and bringing home the remains of U.S. troops.
He also defended his unusual approach in discussing relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded, full-fledged scene, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated island, hundreds dead
For example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help in dealing with the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population was displaced, they did not declare a natural disaster, which is a condition for sending international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that they did not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” Sumbungova said.
The Save the Children organization is forming a team to travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear whether foreign staff will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Since earthquakes are a constant in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared for the rage of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not a common practice on other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands is a challenge even in the best of times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship docked in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit is a problem for Joko's administration to re-elect next year.
Joko is also facing the pressure of long-standing tensions between sects in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes because Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scored for a late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the English Premier League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, scoring in the 89th minute.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's hand well 25 metres ahead of Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 draw.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at the far door.
The shot travelled high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the door.
The ball eventually dropped through goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get to the right position for the ball, and players like Shaq are always dragging it forward as far as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw that Kante was coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much more and just decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the semi-finals with a goal by Belgian player Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
In this action, the Blues attacker handed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> with a heel and fled to Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly passed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he passed nicely through the defense and Hazard ran into the penitentiary.
Hazard overtook the defense and left-footed shot to a distant doorway through Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3 p.m.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were affected by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake on Friday that triggered six-metre waves trapped in the ruins of buildings.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is dotted with the ruins of buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man for Suspicion of Murder After Woman Stabbed to Death
Police opened a murder investigation after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on anyone in the area who has seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I urge everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also call on everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught something in the car camera footage, to contact us, as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed the woman was a resident of Birkenhead and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends who think they know a woman came to the scene and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police are briefing the women's relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that no one should enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told it may take hours before they can re-enter.
A police officer heard him explain to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He keeps saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another one just outside.
Many police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone who has any information, ask to write to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, stating the diary 247 of September 30th.
Cromwell’s statue in parliament has become the latest memory target of a dispute over “rewriting history”
His removal would be a poetic right to destroy many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical puritanists.
But the Cromwell Society called Crick’s proposal “stupidity” and “an attempt to re-write history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate about removing the statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English civil wars Cromwell neither commissioned nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor from the last century.
The great presentation of Cromwell, prepared by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, bears witness to a 19th-century opinion and is part of a personal history that some still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than today) as the protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course monarchies.
Whether this is an entirely accurate representation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this division.
His achievements from the time he was Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered.”
Killing pig kills Chinese farmer to death
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the name “Yuan”, was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a pigsty at a market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
Pig breeders are preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, she and her cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig farm was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody sponge in the pigsty.
Forensic investigations have confirmed that a 250-pound pig killed a farmer to death.
“Brother’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, nicknamed “Wu,” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News as saying.
Security camera footage showed that Yuang came to the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid attacking anyone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market leadership are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of swine attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where a man suffered severe bodily harm.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig squeezed a Welsh farmer against a tractor, but then his wife drove the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not attacking, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“We just want to play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect,” he said.
In the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa comes a heavy rain
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and is weakening.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa has been a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 137 km/h since Sunday morning at 5.00 a.m. East Time and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low air pressure is strengthening over the Pacific Ocean, moving east to the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
The dew will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will mix with a low-pressure area, will create heavy rainfall in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, from 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, deposition of floodplains and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to the high tropical humidity, the amount of precipitation in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, mainly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
Flooding is possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the dispersed nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into raging rivers, and storms will bring local winds and dust in the air.
The approaching low-pressure zone will bring local rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Precipitation above 12 mm is possible, which can result in less deposition of floodplains and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall for the region during the rainy season.
A few scattered tropical patches will begin approaching Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early morning, and late Monday and Tuesday, the rainfall will widen.
Heavy rain will spread to all sides of the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
Temperature fluctuations can occur in the U.S. in October as the Arctic cools and tropical areas remain warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is an excellent example of the dramatic temperature difference in the central United States.
There is a 20-degree difference between Kanas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to stabilize and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern U.S. will enter the warm October with temperatures of around 27°C from the Southern Plain region to parts of the northeast.
In New York, it could have been 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for temperatures above the average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's interrogation
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks an interesting Thursday testimony by Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman accused of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's last-minute turnaround: a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100% convinced that Kavanaugh was touching her in wine and trying to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a tumultuous testimony that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people watched the testimony on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available for other networks that played testimony, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble counting spectators watching the program in the offices.
For a lighter performance, the viewership is similar to that of playing a football match final or awarding an American Film Academy award.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, is leading the day-long hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS network had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
Interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in Friday's drama.
After the office of a moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanough, CNN and CBS cameras recorded on Friday morning how protesters were yelling at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend a Justice Committee hearing.
During the rebuke, he hung up for a few minutes on a view that was caught live by CNN’s cameras.
“I’m standing in front of you,” a woman told him.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks were broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted to hand over Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the candidate next week, as called for by the Democratic minority party.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses of "playing political games" in Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers and said the proposal that Britain and the EU should pay each other’s tariffs was “completely absurd.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of Killing LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in a fatal shooting at Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
Police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS is complementing reports from WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, the police issued a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail amount is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
An eyewitness from East Baton Rouge Parish County issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police are grateful to the Louisiana State Police’s Special Unit for Refugees, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for their “care and seeking justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the LSU.
Last season he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what worries you all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws up ash on Ciudad de Mexico
The ashes of the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern neighborhoods of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday not to approach the volcano as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center observed several cases of thunder and earthquakes.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of the capital, Ciudad de Mexico, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, dubbed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence-supporting protesters clashed with anti-riot police units and thousands of people joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarised vote to secede.
A group of masked proponents of separatism, detained by anti-riot police units, swept them with eggs and powdered paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, usually crowded with tourists.
Later, there were also fights, with police officers having to use batons to stop the fighting.
Supporters of independence, who for hours shouted “without forgetting, without forgiveness,” faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media, 14 people were injured in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions remain in the region that supports independence.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although attendance was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting in the region's polls in violent clashes.
Independence-supporting groups camped in front of the polls overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support state police.
The demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite significant, though close, victories in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s independence-supporting parties have struggled to maintain the initiative this year, with many of the most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who used his phone to record a protest in support of police, explained that the protest was instigated by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is escalating,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in custody since late last year ahead of trial, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests men who drove into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent Street on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, the car was also shot with a crossbow.
With Menga’s goal, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga with his first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had only to admit his second loss in 18 games as Ibrox's coach.
Dolly Mengea's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team tied Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team was thus left without a guest win in this year's championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, who lead on the scale and behind whom they lag by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston increased his line-up of undefeated division to six games, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston has squandered his chances against direct guests
Holt's team should have led well before the goal, as they caused a lot of problems with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break through, but he pushed the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow struck past the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous for the guests in the breaks in the attack.
And this is how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free shot, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Mengai, who shot and shot from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had more possession of the ball, but they couldn't break through the home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't have much to do.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his leg, while Lithgow shot past the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The motions continued to come to Livingston's penitentiary, but the locals rejected all the attacks, and the two offenses - Halkett's misdemeanour over Glenn Middleton's replacement and a misdemeanour for playing by hand - were not judged by the judge.
Livingstone’s “Excellent Performance” – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent performance and result for Livingston.
All of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the character have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt should be credited for the way he woke the team from his arrival.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and arranged well-organized defenses, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under Gerrard's leadership, they are severely lacking in these standards.
There were no shots on goal – only once did they successfully defeat the hosts’ defenses – and this is a kind of wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police prevented 25,000 heads of the crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters – many of them Kurds – who do not support Erdogan’s government and have condemned Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protests reflect dissension over the visitor, whom some German Turks hail as a hero and others despise as an autocracy.
Accident on the road in Deptford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident occurred just a few months after a cyclist died in a collision in which the driver of the car ran away, namely on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday's accident.
Police said they were checking the identity of the man so they could notify the family.
They set up roadblocks and diverted bus lines, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in a riot
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a strictly guarded male prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at about 9.30 a.m. British summertime and is still ongoing.
Officers were called by specialists from the Tornado unit to arrange an incident involving eight prisoners and limited to one wing.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison staff representative said: “We have called in specially trained personnel to handle the incident at HMP Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will take the responsibility for this and, as a result, they may go further behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And last October, an anti-ballistic police unit was called into prison to intervene in a severe incident in which staff were attacked with billiard bullets.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be useful for arid areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa paves its way through the southwest desert and brings the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday and will approach late on Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was raging about 60 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rainfall with individual rainfall up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, are expected to have 25 to 50 mm of precipitation, with individual precipitation up to 100 mm.
For areas beyond the risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be useful, as a drought period is currently underway in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Tracking Center, a good 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing the least extreme drought,” reports weather.com.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still has the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and weakens.
It is expected to reach the mainland of Mexico with the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Precipitation in parts of Mexico can be plentiful and therefore pose a high risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonora, we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a 250 mm chance of rainfall,” according to a report on weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late Tuesday night.
“The greatest danger we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall on the Baja Califonia Peninsula in northwestern Sonora and in the American southwestern desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found at the Excelsion Terrace area in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4:00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remained stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police from Avon and Somerset reported.
Police are urging anyone who may have caught the incident with their mobile phone to come forward.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered ‘Unkindness and Anger’ From Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the hostility and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that “the Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.”
“The vote to appoint Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to appoint one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with outstanding records of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really struggling with my candidacy,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place on Friday at the latest, a Republican party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people had died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, many of them carried away by giant waves sweeping along the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when six-metre waves struck the coast at dusk and carried many to death and destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When a tsunami struck yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, told a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it knocked them all down,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami traveled across the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Aftershocks continued to shake the coastal town on Saturday.
In the area of 2.4 million people, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims had been found trapped under the ruins of buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Donggal, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely disrupted and have no information from the Donggala area.
“There are more than 300,000 people living in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms, as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had affected Palu, but officials say the waves came just at the time of the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, a man on the upper floor screams to warn people on the street in the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collided along the coast and took away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was opened only to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
According to Mr. Dosseva, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale arrived safely in Palu, where employees in the courtyard in front of their premises set up a shelter of tarpaulins, but on the way they saw many scenes of devastation.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when relief groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that they did not allow foreign aid workers with extensive experience to come to Pal.
In accordance with Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and assistance of personnel are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still being treated as a provincial disaster,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their close ones are miracles in the sad stories of natural disasters.
They pulled a boy out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days and her mother’s body lay next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were, according to Mr. Mandagia, his students.
“As an adult in the paragliding industry, I carry my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls sending messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors at the beach festival in Palu during the hours when news of the Roa Roa hotel’s demolition circulated around the paragliding community.
But his messages were marked with only one grey check mark, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
Police in Newport said the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s security worker who was charging an ATM in Newport on the Leeve city centre on Friday morning.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was employed, another man “closed to a Brink’s security officer from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to reports, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on the identity of the suspects should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted, “Being with the official name Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has also used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to unveil his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the show for "personal reasons," the show's creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, meaning ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when he spoke to radio host Big Boy about the album’s title.
“I am you and I am all of you.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” has been turned into Ye—it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of everything we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay-Z, also used his name differently; with or without a thought and in capital letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody student violence.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide monthly subsidies to students and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education are drawing young people into criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in this area, said investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the US does not even have an official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much behind the U.S. and we’re looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next major AI breakthrough happening in the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent companies in the world.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the top-ranked American actor in the game, Othello, and later served as CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese subsidiary.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as a robotics competition organized by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next one would be easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. need to work hard to get state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s the companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best of universities in recent years to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. step up efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation is funding people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poorer, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the creation of a narrower committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation seeking to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has opposed their application to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, but the boycott campaign expressed doubts that participation would be at least 50 per cent, as much as necessary, for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU by agreeing to a deal with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying to join bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I came to vote for the future of the country and for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the result of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko submitted their votes for a referendum in Macedonia on 30 September 2018 on changing the country's name, which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after handing over his ballot.
He added that a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian television Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
For a referendum to succeed, the vote must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government, which took office last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beat Brighton's entire defense and scored a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, on Saturday.
Aguero’s score in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
The Argentinian striker took a midfield pass at the start of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defense players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He lost to one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he handed it to Sterling on his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguera, who beat Brighton's goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with leg problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.”
But Sterling was the one who provided the blue blues with an initial advantage in the First League duel.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling towards the distant door.
The blue-blue striker pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and ruin their chances for the title
The Nationals have fallen out of the finish line, so there's no reason for another attack.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes that on Sunday he will be able to climb the thrower's hill against the Colorado Rockies. This will only happen if the Rockies still have the opportunity to play in the final, because in the Western League, the match has an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies secured the lowest bid on Friday with a 5:2 win over the Nationals, but are still waiting for their first division title.
“Although we can’t win anything, at least we’ll be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a big crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The name of the first metaller for Sunday has not yet been released to the Nationals, but Scherzer is likely to do so.
Scherzer, who will be making his first metal debut for the 34th time, will be playing as a relief player on Thursday and would have had enough rest days by Sunday.
Washington's right-winger scored 18 wins and 7 defeats this season, with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 eliminations with kicks in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump attends conventions in West Virginia
The president indirectly touched upon the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of republican electoral participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“It’s going to be one of the biggest – I’m really trying to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued: “We have this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening now.
They are determined to take back power, using all possible means. You can see rudeness, malice.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to beat in order to gain power and control, because that’s what they want, that’s what they want, that’s what they want, that’s what we’re not going to give them.”
He said the Democrats are on a “resistance and obstruction” mission.
“And you could see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, lowly, and lying.”
He pointed out by name the member of the Committee on Justice, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, with loud disapproval from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I didn't, wait. It was really bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When a Momentum activist in my local party distrusted me, it wasn't a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party who is not welcome to express their views.
A similar thing happened to my colleague, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a no-confidence motion for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a notice for a Friday meeting of the Labour Party, Nottingham East said that “we want meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In the eight years that I have been a member of the parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday meetings have mostly been exactly that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is increasingly apparent that differing views in the Labour Party are not admissible, and any opinion assesses whether this is acceptable to the Party’s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, and colleagues who I had previously thought shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would never agree with, whether in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social media that call for non-election, condemn the politics of the environment and tell me that I shouldn’t be in a Labour party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but do not let themselves be frightened.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of politics is how rates of abuse have become something quite common.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn explained that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each proposal of mistrust or change of the rules for selection, the client becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to lower my head and not be so loud, and I’m going to be “okay.”
But I didn't get into politics because of it.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student — the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which literally caused the classroom in my elementary school to collapse — as a local councilor or government minister, I have tried to advocate for better public services for those most in need.
I never hid my political beliefs, including the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could have been confused by my political views and areas on which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is sailing towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of non-election or political adequacy will deter me from acting in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a member of parliament from the Nottingham East party.
Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr at the top of the ladder
Two late attempts slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this wonderfully fun championship match of the day.
They are now at the top of the rankings and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scales to the home side were swayed by their superior defense and better use of the opportunity, and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“We’ve been through a lot of tests in our games so far and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to the Ayra team, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute hit, which was converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, represented a numerical victory for Melrose and Jason Baggott's skipping the no-conversion attempt.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr at the time of the offense, before hitting half-time and then converting a stand-alone attempt for a score of 17:5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson’s attempt to turn Baggot reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on a stretcher, and after a sequel Ayr progressed with the attempt of Stafford McDowall, who turned him into Climo.
Interim captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon was then given a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of the multiplayer game again with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Clima without a ball, MacPherson scored in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent wing player Gregor Henry into the fifth host experiment.
The star of the series Still Game begins a new career in the hospitality industry
The star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran apparently goes into catering, as he is supposed to become the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
The 56-year-old in the BBC's popular series, for which he also wrote the screenplay, plays Jack Jarvis along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season is the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but the source hinted to Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "flowering restaurant" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which does not have access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Navy blue flags are hung on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody conflict over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for a new voyage across the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest after decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice, which it will receive on 1 October after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and impartiality and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the international court’s decision on large screens across the country and hope that a court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia, which argues that Chile must negotiate – after decades of volatile talks – Bolivia’s access to the sovereign sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s verdict.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not rule in favor of Bolivia — and even if it did, it would not have changed much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign Chilean territory to Bolivia and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the international court’s decision comes just six months after hearing the final arguments means the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, they haven't spoken out in favor of Bolivia, but they're probably going to cost it a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Zarate said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric has absorbed all the goodwill that may have remained from the Chileans, she explained.
The talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken a decision unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backbone.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never be the first to destroy its nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri made a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises made at a meeting between the leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is clearly ahead of the relaunch of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a standstill more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong if it thinks the continuation of sanctions and objections to the announcement of the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is careful to uphold the forecast, without Pyongyang first taking decisive measures to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is a general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning weapons, which the state sees as the only way to ensure its own security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
At fashion magazines in Paris revealed the latest line of huge hats coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complement your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne in their collections for spring and summer 2019 on the runway revealed a collection of bizarre oversized covers that dazzled the style at the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the designers sent their spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
The most prominent Valentine's Day piece was a hat in beige with wide lace, decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included watermelons with gemstones, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but they won’t warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have sewn lips and are more like Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion ones.
One of the creations was similar to snorkeling equipment and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you're lucky.
Fashion connoisseurs assume that giant hats will come to stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow "La Bombi", a straw hat with 60-centimeter lace was noticed, among others, on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand for the extremely impractical hat that flooded social networks sent another great creation through the runway – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit she was wearing.
The raffia bag in a burnt orange color, lined with raffia ribs and a white leather handle, was the central piece of the designer Jacquemus’ La Riviera collection for spring/summer 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores for next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, the demand for oversized accessories would be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career path and the place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation is imprinted on his memory.
But if you speak to a man in his native language, the words are imprinted on his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results of recent exams show that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest success rates in stand-alone schools.
Sixty-eight percent of the students who studied a foreign language achieved an excellent grade.
Data collected by 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an excellent grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an excellent grade.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an optional subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons why employers struggle to fill vacancies can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
With future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in a global world.
If a person learns another language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries has an automatic advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people did not speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, i.e. 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from developing countries, children have a better chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most relevant to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares and equips children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, so this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut in the Lakers at San Diego on Sunday.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will soon be over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers official Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James would likely play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump's Congress in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump is launching a series of congresses in his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled conventions next week, including stops in his favored countries, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee for a vacant seat on the Supreme Court not yet confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after a November vote.
What time will Trump’s convention be in West Virginia and where will it be available online?
Trump’s rally at Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia convention live online on the YouTube channel.
Trump is likely to talk about the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh this week, which became tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, causing Senate confirmation to be expected to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of conventions is to help Republicans, who are awaiting major elections in November, gain new momentum.
That’s why President Trump’s campaign aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Surveillance in Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the grueling campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s convention at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, according to West Virginia MetroNews, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in a month, where he scored more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in opinion polls.
“It’s a bad sign for Morrissey that the president has to come and ‘raise’ him in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team still has the desire to win and keeps hope ahead of Sunday's singles matches
After three one-sided games, Saturday afternoon’s foursomes may have been exactly what Ryder needed this year’s Cup.
The swing pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where has the pendulum gone now?
“They had six points of advantage, but now they have four, so this is probably a new boost for us,” said Jordan Spieth at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, because it leads by four points, and 12 more can get.
But the Americans, according to Spieth, feel that they have the wind in their sails, in addition, among other things, they were stimulated by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and each scored three out of four points.
Spieth was fateful from the initial blow to the green and sets a good example.
The shouts of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when they equalized with Thomas after a two-point gap in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory on the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that he believes that the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all these players have left.
18 holes to fame.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Unusual but charming couple of Europe won four points out of four and are unmistakable.
The two Molliwoods were the only ones not hit by a buggy on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the buggy on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way the energy is obviously flowing between them and the noisy audience confirm the fact that they are the players who will have to be beaten on Sunday, and no other player could better seal any European victories than Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun goes down over Le Golf National.
Possibly both at the same time.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in a four-ball game paired with Alex Noren.
Due to a buggy and two double buggies on the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
Players will not be able to play on Saturday.
Games with four balls and duels of two pairs is an exception interesting to follow closely due to the communication between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better than the team so far and has a great advantage over the last day, but the duels of the two duels have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe goes to the last day of the Ryder Cup with a nice advantage after the Saturday games with four balls and duels of two duels lead with 10:6 against the United States.
The excellent pair, consisting of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, did their best and scored four points with two victories over Tiger Woods and Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who are trying to win the trophy, which she lost two years ago in Hazeltin, had a victory in the morning games with four balls over the American team, which made a mistake, and led in a series of 3:1.
The U.S. team resisted better in two duels, where they won two games, but they could not catch up.
Jim Fury’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles matches if they want to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while Molinari (the pair were dubbed "Molliwood") is only the second pair to score four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they proved themselves again and beat Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with 5 and 4 even more convincingly.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 out of 29 games in four-ball and two-double duels, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who had been resting for the morning four-ball game, returned for two-two duels and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko, who are ranked first and third on the world rankings, in pairs with Henrik Stenson with 2 and 1.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwest of Paris, everything did not go according to the plans of the European team.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
With 2 and 1 they decisively won against Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in two-doubles duels, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team return after a four-point gap ahead of individual matches, although Fury's team only needs a tie to keep the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much for her.
North Korea: “Without confidence, we will not unilaterally disarm”
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations that the continued implementation of sanctions is causing growing mistrust in the United States and that under such conditions, North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
At the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea has taken a number of "significant measures in good faith" over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, tearing down the site for nuclear tests, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we do not see a proper response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in national security, and under such conditions, we will in no way unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual measures, his statement was important because it did not immediately reject unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri followed up on a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the incumbent U.S. President and North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to seek “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” while promising security assurances to Trump’s North Korea.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not given in to calls for the lifting of tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists that we must first disarm nuclear weapons and step up the pressure with sanctions to achieve our goals by force, and even oppose the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
The problem, however, is that the continued implementation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president outlined at the United Nations Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the issue of nuclear disarmament had been discussed with South Korea and not the US, nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula would not have landed at such a dead end.”
Nevertheless, Ri’s tone of speech was quite different from the one last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that an attack on the US mainland with North Korean missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures at the United Nations, but said he still had a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is nuclear-armed.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no timeline for this, saying: “It can take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue resolutely without exception until we recognize the full, definitive and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Rome on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea had already criticised him hours later, saying his demands were "gangster".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to demolish a missile test site and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
Mr. Moon said the “appropriate measures” meant the security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new Harvard University course is to teach all undergraduate students how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing masculine culture of “all-night” learning, in which power is accumulated with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students of the world’s best universities often don’t know the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, designed a course that was his first of its kind in the United States.
He decided to conduct such a course after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the class, a girl came up to him and said, “Why do I only find out now that I’m in my final year?”
She said that no one had ever told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, speaks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success, as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says they opted for such a course when they found that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of the door of a student's home where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to get information about the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success, and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart failure, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student village with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how cigarette smoking affects their health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that a culture of pride with “surviving all-night learning” is still present. He also adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students, resulting in lack of sleep, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, so they can also avoid gaining weight —the brain goes hungry because of lack of sleep, making students constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professor’s lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to conduct a course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that at the next stage, postgraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock to sleep as well as wake up. He also wants to draw attention to the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance in the circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a score sank the hopes of Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in guest appearances: Dolly Menga in Livingston declared the team Steven Gerrard condemned to a 1 : 0 defeat.
The Ibrox team chased their first away win after the February 4–1 victory at St. Johnstone Stadium, but Gary Holt's team scored their second loss in 18 games since leading the Gerrard team, leaving his team behind 8 points for the Scottish League's lead team.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and a select group of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to a common place, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals behind the Hibernian team
Calum Spence, a side judge, suffered a head injury when, according to reports, an object flew into him from the place of the fans of the away team.
Gerrard made eight appearances on the crew, which easily defeated Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt clung to the verified Eleven of Livingston, who had taken the Hearts a week earlier, and was no doubt enthusiastic about how his runaway team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston made better use of it.
The first opportunity came just two minutes after the start, when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short run, who then went on to score Allan McGregor, but the midfielder in the performance was inaccurate and missed the opportunity.
The long free shot of Keaghan Jacobs was then scored by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow failed to get the ball into the goal.
In the last third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than the actual desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was pretty sure that after a run-in with Steven Lawless after 15 minutes of the match, a penalty shot would have to be awarded, but Judge Steven Thomson crushed the Colombian's demands in the pot.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but neither the head shot sent towards the goal by Lassana Coulibaly nor Ovie Eyari's sluggish ball posed any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already completely deserving of perseverance.
The Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs extension with a long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's pitch for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly during the break with wing player Ryan Kent, who immediately turned out to be passing to Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran off his line and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of more goals ahead of the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, then Lithgow was inaccurate after passing out of the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the option of a penalty shot at the end of the match after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not admit it.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-renowned physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
This has become a constant in the scientific world, and it has also gained its place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter, used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect that radioactivity has on atoms in materials.”
Evans: “Madonna, now they’re really talking!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention with his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Can Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Attacking Cells and Destroy Them
Vaccine as part of therapy teaches the immune system to recognize attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then modified in the laboratory
After that, they can "see" the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient
The results of the test vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received a vaccine that the immune system learned to recognize attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are changed in the laboratory to "see" the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different types of cancer” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer.
A similar approach to getting the immune cells of patients who are “teaching” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after performing at SNL, performed a pro-Trump spot with the inscription MAGA on the drop.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was whistled in Saturday Night Live’s studio after a queer spot during which he expressed support for U.S. President Donald Trump, and also said he would be running for president in 2020.
Following the end of his third song, Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap reading "Make America Great Again", West began an attack on the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he says, ‘How can you like Trump, because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I were worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This year’s SNL show began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Commission, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
A recording of West's monologue was not released, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known whether Rock intended to make fun of West.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the back of his head due to the inscription on the hat.
“They came to me on the stage.
I was told, ‘Don’t go on stage with that hat.’
I've been harassed!
They say I'm lost," he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman’s cloak, because that means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments were prepared at least twice by the audience for whistle-blowing, and the SNL team members were clearly embarrassed, and someone told Vanity: “There was a deadly silence in the studio.”
West was invited at the last minute to a goat replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused a lot of surprise with the video for the song "I Love it", where he wore a Perrier mineral water bottle costume.
West was supported by Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR REFUSING PARADISE.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothes or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
And so do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "a being formally known as Kanye West.
Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy, was the first musician to change his name.
Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we cannot forget one more musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was the Artist, once known as Prince.
Man Accused of Attempting Murder for Stealing Person in Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in an East Belfast restaurant on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington strikes hard against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for howling a sword in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval-colored fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who sharply condemned the stereotype of a masochist hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that they can earn respect only with persistence.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture magazine that he thought something went wrong and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #JazMovie period.
The actor, who recently married a 31-year-old co-star from Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, admitted that he has strong beliefs about the subject.
“Personally, I’m now seriously wondering where we made a mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“What did we teach men as we grew up about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do they teach us on TV and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose this particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
“There was something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the filming of any pre-story or sequel to the Game of Thrones, because he "completed with battlefields and horses".
In November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife Rose on film.
“It’s because of this show that I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love-selected Kit character of Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are affected.
In the second quarter of 2018, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, which represents a change compared to the past.
Typically, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China due to transfusions of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials from a conference in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 per year.
The transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is a very pressing problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very prevalent.
As conservative values still apply in the country, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaking data on Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that these accusations come from individuals and far-right websites.
“Lies, lies and more inadmissible lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The data appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate session on allegations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after three senators ended Kavanaugh's interrogation.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that the IP address can identify the source of the posting that is supposed to be associated with Senator Waters’ office and conclude that the information was posted by one of the staff, Hill said.
“These unfounded accusations are utterly false and pure lies,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leakage of this data.
These unfounded accusations are utterly untrue and a pure lie.”
The statement by Senator Waters quickly ran into criticism online, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“From this denial is the branch of anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This may mean that it’s not from the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they haven't done, they shouldn't show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one who accused him.
He needs to stay calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters’s response to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running for Waters City in the midterm elections, tweeted.
“If that’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified "the relevant institutions and law enforcement agencies of these false accusations.
“We will ensure that perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English: Rowan Atkinson as Secret Service Agent
The search for clues to Brexit in any new British film has become a tradition, and it also applies to the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which first came to the screen in 2003 with the title Johnny English and a sequel in 2011 with the title Johnny English 2.
Will a fun satire about how miserable we are, a new export opportunity for us?
Incompetent Johnny English, with bulging eyes and unusual grimaces, obtains permission to remix the streaks; his name suggests that he is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
He is a clumsy undercover agent who, despite his bizarre moves, contains a piece of Clouseau, a snippet of Mr. Bean, and a trifle of the one who contributed the final note to the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It’s also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV ad for Barclaycard, leaving a real mess behind.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were touching his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly shown, but humor seems a bit mild and excessively unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without bad conscience.
It seems that humor is for children and not so much for adult viewers, which is why Johnny English’s rejected adventures are not as innovative and oriented to me as Atkinson’s silent sketches in the role of Mr. Bean.
It is now clear that the UK is in serious trouble.
The hacker has infiltrated the online network of Britain’s most secretive agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to a competent agent, represented in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the turning point for the prime minister, a pompous figure who has already suffered a breakdown due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson has tried to play the alleged Theresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that she can help herself with.
Intelligence informs her that all active spies are exposed, so she has to choose one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who informally teaches how to work undercover: here are the writers hit, as English performs some sort of espionage “rock academy”.
The English are taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets a longtime collaborator, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are ready to create even more trouble in the name of Her Majesty's Secret Service, while meeting the fatal Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously influenced by a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: that’s the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos when they smuggle themselves onto the roof of a Volt yacht, and when English tries to use virtual reality glasses to get to know the interior of Volt's house, he manages to create general chaos.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the sympathetic and energetic, it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
As with other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: is the British film capable of giving Atkinson a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies plans for a four-day working week for the British, with a paycheck for a five-day working week.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan where the British would work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The client wants the savings that companies generate as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to flow to the workers and give them an extra day off.
This way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high salary.
Sources say that the idea corresponds to the economic plan of the party and the plan to put the state on the side of the workers.
Trade unions support the transition to a four-day work week, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It’s not going to happen overnight, but four-week work is the goal that we will strive to achieve with a customer’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the customer’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party supported the four-week working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party as a whole does not currently support this goal.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-week work week is not the party’s policy and the party is not thinking about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to showcase his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “reckless directors” and “winners” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current stakeholders in plumbing companies may not regain the full share, as the Labour Party could introduce “deductions” on the basis of alleged injustices.
It also endorsed plans for the inclusion of workers in boards of directors and the introduction of the Equity Inclusion Funds, which would transfer 10% of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed in 60 Minutes whether their views could be altered by an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh.
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could convince him to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the 60 Minutes correspondent asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out anything that would change her mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than a colleague from South Carolina.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do this?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems carved into the stone.
“I’ve created my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and I would need a very compelling reason to change him,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know the following: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of those whom she named could confirm it.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed in any way to reducing poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event featuring a truly exceptional cast of stars and with the same extraordinary mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands of people will attend the festival, this time for the seventh time. They will occupy the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the elimination of extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free event ticket (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert participants had to complete a series of assignments or “acts” such as volunteering, a letter to a world leader, a phone call, or any other meaningful way to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them to ask for action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicticism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011, more than 19 million “acts” of its supporters have been recorded in pursuit of a range of different goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders make more than $37 billion worth of commitments and policies, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions was 390 commitments and messages that have already paid or collected at least $10 billion.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision makers committed to helping “children realize their full potential,” which Rwanda has pledged $35 million in aid to help eliminate malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from the Global Citizens movement.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social injustice of malnutrition in the historical archives,” Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Nutrition Partnership, told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions called for by the United Kingdom to improve the diet of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will co-finance the Power of Diet project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “It will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports – U.S. Interior Ministry
According to the Washington Examiner, US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke said that Washington could use the Navy “as needed” to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
However, according to the officials, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this, and the Navy will make sure that our shipping lanes are open and blocked if necessary, preventing Russian energy from flowing into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers Association, a nonprofit group that addresses itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, pointing out that it is in fact the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence and replace fuels,” he said, calling Russia a “one trick pony” with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is supposed to oust Russia, which is a much cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is supposed to be the “hostage” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing gas pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington strongly opposes the project only for economic reasons and that this is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a September meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Industrial Association (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interference of a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Union (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “examine” her candidacy for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “examine carefully” her candidacy for president after midterm elections.
At the Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she said.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my candidacy for president."
At a meeting in the town hall, Warren slammed President Donald Trump for “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren has repeatedly criticized Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet released Friday, Warren said: “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
A poll released on Thursday showed that most of her own voters believe that Warren should not be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, with 85 percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters.
Thirty-two percent of them would have supported her bid.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had more support for the candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents saying it was supported and 48 percent saying it was opposed.
Other senior Democrats who would be eligible to run in the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a rally in support of Donald Trump mentioned the post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he is going through after he returns, connects me to other families who are dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury with which our soldiers are returning,” he told an audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son’s arrest as “an elephant in the salon” and said her son and other war veterans were returning slightly altered, stiffened, wondering where the respect for what fellow soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military had donated to the country was.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and possession of weapons in the winery, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the district filled the court lobby on Friday to support a legal challenge to the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace’s lawsuit against Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal politics, was not released.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, gang members,” abused her, but the U.S. authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors of the states that support Grace, including El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications come to the United States, have described as countries that are constantly grappling with gang violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “scorns decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the court said.
In the request, state prosecutors further stated that policies denying immigrants the right to enter are detrimental to the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor force”.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum in June to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear related to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to eliminate all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The number of victims in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue attempts are underway to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her feverish boyfriend at an evacuation center in the ravaged city of Palu.
“Rescuers are constantly bringing in bodies.
“There is a lack of clean water.”
They seemed to be citizens, returning to destroyed homes, breaking through wet things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals destroyed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered back and shoulder injuries, were resting outside a military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors for continuous strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get out.
I think it squeezed me against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family for the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘harassment’ with ‘propaganda ads’
A week after the publication of a four-page advertisement by an official Chinese newspaper in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the U.S. press for spreading propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Sunday mentioned a paid addition to the China Daily newspaper in the Des Moines Register — the best-selling newspaper in Iowa — after he accused China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials described Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense push to pressure China.
Although foreign governments routinely advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an intensifying trade war in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to hit exporters in states like Iowa that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now duplicates this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government used the highly respected American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see very few other opinions in Beijing’s newspaper stands and no real reflection of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens about China’s worrying economic path, as the press is strictly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers rejected an offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans Lose Voters Before Midterm Elections Failing with Kavanaugh, Analysts Warn
Analysts warn that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
Emotions are extremely high here, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell University in Syracuse, for an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute pressure to investigate the FBI would be enough to calm angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the advanced group MoveOn, on Friday, according to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters sang “November is Coming!” as they demonstrated in the hallway of the Senate as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee opted to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will transcend all boundaries,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say they’re already strong, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unspecified voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault on a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the council vote or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about how Republicans deal with it and how they treated Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of the US Priorities group that supports Democrats in the election, told the channel.
Americans, on the other hand, seem somewhat divided between whether to believe Ford’s or Kavanaugh’s testimony more, with slightly more backing for the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony most likely, and 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh most likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was likely or certain to have lied during the testimony, and only 30 percent said so about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other indictee, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified last week before the Senate Judiciary Council under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that a candidate for the Supreme Court showed her the genitals while they were together at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web intends to launch a new Internet to combat Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, opens a startup company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners’ open-source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “to rule the world.”
“We decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a “personal data storage” or POD
This can include contact information, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser and at the same time.
The peculiarity of a personal data storage is that the user can fully determine who can access which information.
The company calls this “personal authorization with data”.
CEO John Bruce says the company’s idea is to pool resources, processes and relevant skills that will give everyone access to the Solid platform.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
As early as this week, technology developers around the world could use the tools available on Inrupt’s website to create their own decentralized applications.
Berners-Lee said he and the group “are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether we could introduce a complete change that could overwhelm all of their business models overnight.”
“We’re not asking for permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is to “provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet with the founding of the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The Feast of the Victoria Cross of World War I
In their hometown for 100 years, they celebrate the award of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the English Church, who won it as a fighter in the First World War.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann earned recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But four days later, he was shot by a sniper and never found out that he had been awarded this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel’s grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deed earned him the decoration.
On September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the St. Quintin's Channel "through a very dense fog and under heavy fire of battlefields and machine guns."
Later, he flew towards the firing line and led the line forward with "greatest heroism", then attacked the machine gun itself and hit three members of the detachment.
On October 4, 2018, just a month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said the old man’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so he teaches me humility.”
With their brother, Dr. James Vann, they also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade” and “that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support expressed by many people.”
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they were given Pig Pepe.
Imagine: You’ve been up all night watching the fully-sold out Bellator 206, and then you can’t see the main event.
The San Jose event consisted of 13 duels, including six on the main dance floor, and was broadcast live on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned to find that the broadcast had been replaced by a play on Pep the Pig.
A lot of people didn’t like him because he was awake until the morning because of the duel.
One of the fans described the switch to a children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to the government regulation, this content is not appropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"Pepa's dog. Yes."
Bellator’s chairman, Scott Coker, said they were trying to adjust the schedule to include spectators in the UK in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix it,” Coker said.
But then it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to arrange this until Sunday after our time or Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, many messages were exchanged during the switching and not all of them were kind.
We tried to fix the issue; we assumed it was just a technical error.
The real reason, however, was a government decree.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we will endure five fights – as usual. We tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we counted on that.
This is a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “lesser” about sex
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to anyone because of his sexual orientation — but that gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that “not everyone is like him” when he entered high school.
In a talk on the first show of Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics was diminished.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was absent due to months of illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less valuable" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
“To this day, these feelings of inferiority and differentity are the real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to achieve success.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, not to disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become an influential advocate of LGBT rights and has appeared twice at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to urge states to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy to be able to speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said his romance with a man — American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — "surprised him."
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but says the difference in age has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young,” he said, “at the age of 14 he attended the first Olympic Games and three years later his father died, it’s hard to find someone of the same age who would experience similar ups and downs.”
The couple adopted a child, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, in June, and Daley says it changed his "whole view".
“If you asked me last year, all I would have to say is ‘I have to win a gold medal,’” he said.
But, you know, there are bigger things in the world than an Olympic gold medal.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
The son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets to London 2012, as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “You won’t be in the first place this time, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until he actually stopped breathing and was dead that I finally had to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I’d dreamed of all my life – diving at the Olympics in front of a home audience. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired his first choice of song – Proud musician Heather Small, who accompanied him in preparation for the Olympic Games and which still makes his skin tingling.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 (BST).
Unprepared Mickelson wins Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he will have to get back in shape again so that it does not become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for the 12th time, was allowed to sit with the four of them on Saturday.
Instead of being at the center of events as it has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a cheerleader and partly in improving his game to fix what weighs on him.
Given that even at the height of his career he did not measure straight, the 48-year-old does not fit the best of the narrow Le Golf National field, where a long glaciation inevitably penalizes the missed kicks.
And if the pitch itself wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson would have to deal with the exact winner of the British Open Cup, Francesc Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, who have four games less at the start of 12 games, started well, Mickelson’s game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but otherwise he didn't say much.
“He fully understood the role he played today, he patted me on the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the celebrities and he has made an outstanding contribution to the teams in the past and also this week.
I had no idea he was going to play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought it should be done that way.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Fald's record for the highest number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of Ryder’s Cup career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence on the team also brings some intangible benefits.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to make people crazy, and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were having fun when they faced him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage could soon be skewed
Thomas Bjorn, European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
A young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a game in Valderrama, where the side, whose captain was Seve Ballesteros, had five points ahead of the Americans, and broke through the goal with a hair-only advantage, with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Remember, we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but barely,” Bjorn (pictured) said after seeing the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led at Le Golf National, lead 10-6.
History has shown to me and to everyone on the team that the Cup is not over.
Play full tomorrow.
Go ahead and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it says so on the board.
We have a goal to win this Cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He’s always saying that I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we’re also well aware of who’s on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about playing his players on a challenging pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never overtake him here.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow, the game of individuals will be at the forefront, so we will have to deal with it differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things go well, but when you’re there alone, your golf skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: You need to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind, and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they did as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the reversal in the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brooklyn before he finished as a loser when Europe performed "The Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, took his players to the final day of the game.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When this momentum gains perseverance, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
We created the right layout and put the boys in a way that made us feel like we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the battle and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the upper half of the order.
“With this group of guys, I chose this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the selection of individuals.
New German Warship Delayed Again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but due to system failures and rapidly rising costs it will not be at least until next year, local media reported.
The surrender of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing the military representative.
The vessel is due to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, commissioned in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen class frigate.
It is expected to have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates could stay out of the home port for up to two years.
Continuous delays mean that high-end warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to influence overseas with their power, will become obsolete by the time they start using them, the newspaper Die Ziet notes.
The unlucky frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and German media cited a number of key "software and technical flaws" that would render a warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on the older Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's ability to upgrade it in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz was said to be twice the weight of a similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including the training of the crew – has become a problem.
It is projected to reach a dizzying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy was in fact "lacking ships suitable for deployment."
The official said that the issue has worsened over time as old ships have been decommissioned and replacement vessels have not been provided.
He regretted that no ship of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Fund is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study is underway on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to find out how bats use their diets to hunt for food.
They hope the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Fund for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and tiny bats and brown eared bats and bypass bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At key sites of the estate, special recorders will be installed to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
A professional audio analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of bat calls and what kinds of what they do.
They will then prepare a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the province.
Rob Dewar, NTS Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are best suited for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined sharply in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which affects shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting, as well as flycatchers and certain types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by house cats pose a risk.
Bats aren't really blind.
Because of their night hunting habits, they help each other with their ears rather than their eyes.
To accurately determine errors and obstacles on the flight path, they use a sophisticated echolocation technique.
The NTS, which is responsible for the supply of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspections of shelters and occasional rescues.
The organization has even established the first and for now the only Scottish reservation dedicated specifically to bats on the Three estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The estate manager, David Thompson, says the estate is ideal territory for them.
“We have an excellent area for bats on the Threave,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all quality habitat.
However, there is still much known about bats, so the work we do here and on other farms will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the estates, since the possible unintentional destruction of a single bat maternity hospital can lead to the death of up to 400 females and pups, which can mean the collapse of the entire local population.
Bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their maternity hospitals.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Butterfly Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we simply don’t know how well their populations hold on to many species.”
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape, Lawyers Prepare for German Magazine Lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people wanted to “promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event.
Speaking to 142 million Instagram followers in a live video hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for allegations they have called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “non-property damages in an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In a filing filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she is said to have returned to the actor’s room after a meeting at the Mayorga nightclub with Ronaldo, who allegedly raped her there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told her that he is a “99 percent good man” who disappoints “only one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed sexual intercourse, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “terribly afraid of revenge” and worried about “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement, as the alleged incident continues to cause her severe trauma.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before the transfer from Real Madrid to Manchester United, and this summer, under a $100 million deal, he moved to the Italian giant Juventus.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret’ the loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would regret forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was “concerning” that Toyota UK told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been voiced by other carmakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call supply chain risks in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “time-to-time” basis, with parts of suppliers from the UK and the EU for custom-made cars arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK were to leave the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could lead to border disturbances, which industry representatives say could lead to congestion and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store parts for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company’s representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks".
“We need to reach a deal. We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told Today BBC Radio 4.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers’ data is that we must absolutely be able to continue a highly successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be stopped, but in the long term it warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is the founder of the Unite union at the plant, said that its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job will never come back.”
The government representative said: "We need to present a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” due to the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election interference, the ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and the president's potential obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general’s envoy and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s rumors for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing the use of a wiretapping device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president on the basis of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he was planning to step down.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he "would not like to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid conflict with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women accused of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not yet been set for him. It could happen this week, but given everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court, we could postpone it for another week.
We’ll see. I always like to make sure you’re informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a White House meeting with reporters since September 10th.
The show's host, Chris Wallace, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of the meetings was not attributable to the resistance to “setting up” TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they were set up.”
She also said that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president holds more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Sanders said: “But if journalists can address the President of the United States directly with their questions, it’s infinitely better than discussing with me.
We are trying to make this possible as much as possible, and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks and that you will have a conference at which you will be able to speak with the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when free-spirited and partly bizarre, he appeared in front of assembled journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude to the state and their desire to continue their work even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to paying the costs of applications for regulating the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on a withdrawal have continued, as decision-making approaches this autumn.
However, the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
I would therefore like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from all over the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and the communities we care for.
You can feel absolutely at home in Scotland. We really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers line supporter Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday’s 31:27 defeat against Vanderbilt Commodores, Mike Organ of The Tennessee newspaper reported.
The head coach of Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the edge of the field and sort of collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on a stretcher and taking him off the field for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris from the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "details of the type/scope of the injury are not yet known" and that Tennessee State University is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, currently a freshman at the university, plays for Tennessee State University for the first time since leaving the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strikes before he was out of the game, raising his total number of strikes during the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless according to the new plans of the Tories
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
Increased hip fee will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of hips when buying real estate in the UK, and the money collected will be allocated to the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide affordable housing and higher taxation for high-income people.
The increased hip will be charged to people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will spur the government’s efforts to end homelessness.
The surcharge – which will be charged in addition to the current hip, including the elevated levels introduced two years ago for other homes and rental properties – could be no less than 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with the imposition of the measure.
It is estimated that non-citizens in the UK will buy 13 percent of newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and a more difficult purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “ghost cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was adopted just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a cut in hips to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
Major construction companies have been accused of raising prices by seizing land that they don’t actually use, and Mrs May has called on her to drop quotas for affordable housing in order to repair Britain’s “residential embarrassment.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and an end to forcible evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiership to renewing the British dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
This also means repairing our dysfunctional housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, buying a home is as easy as for British citizens from Garages.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is all too far away, and the humiliation of homelessness remains all too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to run Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to once become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving North-East, currently third in the Premier League, with three points less than the first-placed.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren again took him to the Scottish Championships in the final season.
“I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got the B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland often in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that pulled me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team boss Aloa Athletic, who had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as the successor to such big names, he felt no fear.
“For me, success is measured by the question, ‘Can I take this club back to the Premier League?’”
In terms of structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy road to get there, but it would probably only be considered successful if we could take the club there again.”
Ross only works as a manager for three years, after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a part of the Hearts coaching staff for 15 months.
Aloi then helped prevent a relegation to the third league, and St Mirren led from the margin of relegation to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real turning point,” he remembered taking over Aloe.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than playing.
It sounds funny because I was doing well as a player, I was doing relatively well with it and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can become difficult.
There are a lot of things to deal with every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but I just feel like management is the right thing for me.
I’ve always wanted to run a club, and I’m doing it now, and I feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The result of the research: the ideal time for beer is on Saturday at 5.30 p.m.
The summer heat has increased the revenues of hard-hitting British pubs, but pressure has also increased on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business consultant, who compiled the data, said: “Sustainable sunny weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern as June last month, when pub revenues increased by 2.8 per cent, only that the restaurants were still strong.
The fall in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June was even higher in July.
In comparison, traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased more than in restaurants.
Due to the sunny weather, sales in pubs, which mainly offer food, also decreased, but not as dramatically as with restaurant managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go for a drink.
In various pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% in one month, while food sales decreased by 3%.”
Paul Newman of RSM’s Leisure and Hospitality Analysts Group said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When selling in the hospitality market, the biggest factors remain the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the fall of 4.8 percent year-on-year will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.

One in five children has a secret account on social media that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some of whom are just 11 years old – has a secret account on the social network that hides it from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears of posting sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “major” account for their parents
One in five children – some of whom are just 11 years old – creates an account on social media that hides it from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about posting sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they manage a censored “main” account they show to their parents, but also have private accounts.
The mother, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, noticed that her daughter invited visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Board of Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” at the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as the non-executive director of the annual General Assembly of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete in the field and outdoors, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who direct the sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would be a huge asset to the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I am thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope that I can truly contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will be able to recover and to what extent.
The work was hard, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided online reviews
A company that makes breast pumps has split the reviews with an advertisement that compares mothers to cows in milk.
To launch the “first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad to show mothers all the freedom the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a barn filled with hay on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I pump, but there is no tail,” and “If you haven’t noticed, these are not my tits, these are my tits.”
The congregation continues: “Deplete, deplete, feed the babies, deplete, deplete, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on Facebook’s website, caused considerable resentment online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was a joke at the expense of the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and breastfeed to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them in the first days after they are breastfed.”

The other commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both mother and cub.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who keep their babies?”
Someone else added: "Advertisement completely without feeling."
Others praised the ad, with one woman acknowledging that she found the song “for dying ridiculous.”
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I'd buy it myself if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as it was meant to be.
“It’s a great product,” another wrote.
Someone commented: “This is a funny ad that targets moms who are depleting their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they were dancing with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bra, allowing women to move, hold the baby and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD at mothers, further commented: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
By pulling the parallel between milk pumping women and dairy cows, we wanted to put milk pumping and all its challenges in the spotlight, while showing in a fun way that women can connect with, an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring..
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump came on the cover.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children took a stroll along the modeling trail for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even if the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to hand them over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are undocumented migrants, so they fear that applying for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other family members of households would be required to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are penalized foreigners.
That is why we continue to search for these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to treat children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month after they have been detained, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard, the shelter workers said.
Many will appear with a video conference call, not in person, to defend themselves in front of an immigration judge.
Those deemed not to be eligible for aid will be swiftly expelled.
The longer children are in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which, according to shelter workers and reports generated in the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts.
Advocates said these concerns were greater in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child’s distress are more likely to go unnoticed due to their size.
They added that moving children to the city of tents without emotionally preparing them or giving them a chance to say goodbye to friends can complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even if the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces on Syrian soil were illegal, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would “act accordingly.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have had to leave their homes since 2011, is “almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we have cleared the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading unreasonable fears” that persuaded refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are changing into a political issue, which should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement to end the war.
United Nations diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a tampon zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who “will be uprooted.”
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first session of a new committee soon, composed of members of the government and opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem defined the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee, saying the committee’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution” and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with an interpellation and scandal.
Which would have been without a doubt “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at its peak, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during its peak time, which is more than four years ago, according to Nielsen, when it had 1.7 million, and the "Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC reached the highest number of cable clients with 3.5 million viewers on the night of important news.

Contrary to what is on television, of course, the story from Washington could decide the future of the Roe v. Wade case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.

There was no way he could break away, not even when Brett Kavanaugh faced the Senate Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

The money will be used to prepare for the tightest midterm elections.
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, as the reorganization of congressional districts put the two candidates in a race for the same seat.
This recently newly divided suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a special election this spring in another district.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania 12th district, which is heavily overlapping with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally plotted in favor of Republicans.
The match in the new 17th district touched on the fight to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Democratic Campaigns Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March special election for the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give Democrats a slight preference.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against El Salvador because of China’s support, and then they withdrew.
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama amid “recent decisions to discontinue recognition of Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, a ministry spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were being considered against El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to fight drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected this Central American country, with high unemployment and high murder rates.
During internal meetings, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in preventing migration towards the United States.
By mid-September, top government officials had clarified that they wanted the conference to continue, thus concluding considerations of penalties for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the US government attaches to the meeting, diplomats added.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further hard messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to the discussion on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of the judiciary, about which there is already a lot of evidence in public records.
Mr Mueller is also alleged to have directed the investigation into whether Mr Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in the attack on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer to the authorities and perhaps even to the jury of his colleagues just as he prepares to speak to his constituents again.
There are many questions in this regard, and I do not want to say that Mr Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is the fall of his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight could last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
At such turning points, the course of history is changing and the relentless march of democracy is being accelerated or halted.
Americans are facing more of these challenges right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he proposed secret filming of the president and speculated about his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times report was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed as a Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will demand Mr. Trump's accountability?
If we fail in these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later ordered me to light the sabbath candles on the swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the return of Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, with it being clear that a victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month will put them in a convincing position to qualify for the Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season before a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this as a springboard for greater achievements.
“It was a well-deserved point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and take away the point.
Maybe we could win in the end, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were better in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but this will be a difficult game, because they achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can do our best and achieve a positive result.
The past year has been undeniably difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes to the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind and achieve success.”
Women's sleep problems due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talk to their family members about it.
Half of the respondents to the Nationwide survey said they were discussing the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they don’t try to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t talk to them about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost estimation.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs or self-insurance with your own funds if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles during the transition.
Choose a health representative by determining a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that professionals will take into account your health wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also empowering a person for their finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.

In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
A man who was returning home at night was shot several times with an air rifle.
The shooter, in the 1940s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was repeatedly shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see his assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police have called for any witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise further.
With communications cut off, rescuers from the Regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key information about Palu and Donggala in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary with an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a landscape that stretches along more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated 299,000 inhabitants in 2017.
The main economic activities of the province of Central Sulawesi are aquaculture and farming, in particular in the central region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also an important activity in the region, but it takes place mostly in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been hit several times by the tsunami over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected northern Donggalo, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur here regularly.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian estimation, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia’s most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake hit one of the Mentawai Islands and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: A salamander earthquake hit the regency of Pidia Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time the tsunami did not start, but the collapsed buildings caused the death of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok and caused the deaths of more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin's acquaintance, when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, took the phone out of her hands.
Palina was detained at the Mat-Su Pre-Trial Institution and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, the KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “definitely innocent” when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palin was charged with three class A offences, which means he could be imprisoned for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B offence, which is punishable by one day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
Palin has not been charged with a crime for the first time.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in reporting domestic violence and possessing an alcoholized weapon in connection with the incident.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
In 2016, veteran groups criticized Sarah Palin for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise further in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of the earthquake.
When a tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people were detained at a beach festival in Palu.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Saifull Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is said to have used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bicycle path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan after he ran over several pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice on the death penalty application filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty can be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, the grand federal jury informed Saip of the 22 counts of indictment, which included eight counts of murder in support of extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and intent,” prosecutors said, describing Saip’s manner as “shameful, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pamiano".
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District District Court pronounced the last death penalty ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The death penalty was last imposed in the city of New York in a federal case in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, did not show any regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
Police also said he had requested the unveiling of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
On 22 counts, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saip, said they were “apparently disappointed” with the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting an admission of guilt in exchange for a life in prison without the possibility of release for all involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Negotiations on Brexit should be entrusted to NIGELA FARAGEA, says Tory MEP
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a Tories conference, vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former Ukip leader said politicians should "feel the heat" of eurosceptics when one of his own MPs, Theresa May, suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a march in Birmingham that the UK "would be out by now" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to harmonize their deeply divided species was further highlighted by the Tory people, who favoured a Brexit, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep her plan in line with the attacks of Brexit advocates, opponents of Brexit and the EU.
The Allies insisted May would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the "cao".
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave convention in Solihull to “want to get rid of Chequers.”
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and assign him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The MP from Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we need to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU with the following words: “In world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
The meeting was also attended by the Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Ministry President, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active on the streets and lead us to the election.
Please let go of Chequers and start listening.’”
In a message addressed to Ms. Mayeva, she added: “Premiers keep their job when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be allowed to “feel the heat” if they intend to issue a decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political classes,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and today we are gathered to tell them: ‘We will not allow this to happen to you.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, feel the heat.”
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which has assured us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the remainers marched through Birmingham, where they then held a two-part meeting in the city centre.
After the group was formed, a handful of activists waved the flags of the Tories against Brexit this weekend.
Labour aristocrat Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for security concerns about using the party’s app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus deal, for a barrier-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren will “examine” the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “examine participation in the presidential race closely” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
It is at the heart of speculation to be able to deal with Trump in 2020.
The Holyoke event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.”
Arrest after LSU player Sims' death in shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayd Sims on Friday.
The police station in Baton Rouge announced the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a news conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
They posted a video of Friday’s shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the South University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and finally died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 198-centimeter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is approaching the World Cup title, and the team has ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettle
On Saturday, when Valtteri Boltas qualified before Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that “Mercedes’ team will have a strong influence on the race.”
Bottas started well at the start and almost left Hamilton on the dry when he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettle to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of the traffic, which should be decisive.
Mercedes drove into boxing later and left him behind Vettle, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver's dislike left the inside open and risked to fall behind after two moves to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started with the last type of net and was in seventh place until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then, for most of the race, he drove without changing tires, intending to finish fast, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finished in the 44th round, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen took fourth place.
It’s a tough day because Valtteri drove fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he let me pass.
The team has done a really great job to reach first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she did not disclose a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch on Ford’s testimony before the Senate’s commission of inquiry, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil, corrupt and lying.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen that has happened in the Senate in recent days that we can see anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the revelations and revelations and people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer ... you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal him.”
All right, wait a minute.
“No, we didn’t,” he added, referring to the senator’s impression.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies that it came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s accusations, I did not disclose her letter,” Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked me for confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
Her denial, however, clearly did not suit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
It may not be true, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats were abusing the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all means possible.
You have seen the malice, the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to run to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for Giants vs. Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made amends for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the Saturday's Dundee game 5-3.
The Giants scored two goals early on with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for home, then Dwyer again scored an advantage for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalled the Dundees before Lundvald Nielsen's two goals guaranteed them victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 from the background on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the game in the fourth minute with 3:35 with the help of Kendall McFaull, and Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, was given by David Rutherford.
In the intensive opening part, Sullivan again led the home side to the game at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt handed Cownia a tie at 15:16.
Dwyer took charge of the Giants during a break when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The home side gathered again, and Bouchard compensated for the backlog by a heavy goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead the Dundees in the lead at the end of the second third and ensured the victory with the fifth goal of his team in the half and ensured the victory with the fifth goal of his team in the half of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller kills hundreds of people on plane to escape earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controllers are being hailed as a hero after sacrificing their lives so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
The Sulawesi earthquake on Friday, followed by a tsunami, killed more than 800 people and left many missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in the heavily swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
It remained in it that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped off the control tower because he thought he was falling down.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media outlet ABC News reported.
We have prepared a helicopter to take him from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart breaks when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country’s disaster relief agency said access to cities in Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was limited.
“The death toll is expected to increase further, with many bodies under the rubble and many of them unreachable,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said in a statement.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was ravaged by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft bring assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to complete all evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?” according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says it is missing one person after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to the call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday they had taken seven people to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon just ahead of the track.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had landed very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to break through the waist-to-belt stretching water to the emergency exits of a sinking plane.
He said the stewards panicked and yelled, but he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were repairing the pier nearby also came to the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in the past two decades in air accidents in Papua New Guinea, but this is the first accident to happen to Air Niugini.
An analyst determined the time of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, prosecutors presented their evidence in a retrial to a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his previous claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, he said he was "lying because [my] truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The cell phone footage shows that they only met for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact details from his phone during the time after Chambers' death.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial was to be judged by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hiphop?
The hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based band The High Breed claims hip-hop has drifted away from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make conscious hiphop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York babysitter sues couple for firing her for ‘racist’ message
A New York City nanny sues the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a wrongly sent message from her mother, who complained that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies the racist treatment and compares the lawsuit with “extortion”.
In 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed disappointment when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, discovered that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEEEE IS ONE BLACK,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her failure, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “unpleasant,” fired Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a poor job, so she wanted to hire a Filipina, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for a day's work, then sent home with Uber.
Maurice is now seeking damages of $350 a day from the couple in court for a period of six months to perform the work she was initially hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, things like that don’t happen,” she told Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that the dismissal of Maurice was reasonable because they feared they would no longer be able to trust her after the remorse.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“Would you be willing to trust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on.”
Comparing the lawsuit to “emigration,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to put up with someone that way?
That’s not good,” the banker added.
Although proceedings are still pending in court, the court quickly condemned the couple’s public opinion on social media because of their behavior and way of thinking.
The publishers of the stories about the bear Paddington were afraid that readers would not connect with the talking bear, revealed a new letter
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after receiving the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the skin of someone who first reads the book before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun to find out now that Paddington has become an outstanding hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little teddy bear toy, would be outraged at the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "bitter-sweet".
Regarding Paddington, who she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said her father was very proud of his final success.
“He was a quiet man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You’re proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was transported to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors made a futile effort to preserve her life.
“She called us regularly to say she was really sick, she didn’t expect it to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call, and he told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping, slowly faded away and left her system.
She had been dying for a while, and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing that all this was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was surrounded by my family and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers, unaware of the test she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head bowed down and tears were running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but I felt this strong feeling of sympathy for Hope on the plane.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Complaining woman glues posters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are sticking posters on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can reach out to for support.
Mrs. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he became depressed, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, a 45-year-old living in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile illuminates every room.”
But before his death, he stopped working because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sibling when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that the domino effect will be triggered.”
Mrs. Davis made posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies's friend for several years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was completely on the floor, and when the children opened the presents, he didn’t make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a serious trauma to them, but they had to process it: “She cut a hole in the whole family.
She tore us apart.
But we must continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the air as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could actually carry out what he asked for – after the length and scope of the limited investigation, it might unify us,” Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “collapse” because of the tightened party stagnation.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time during which the investigation would take place.
There are only five weeks until the November 6 midterm elections – if Republicans are expected to cut themselves off badly, it will greatly weaken them in trying to elect the man they want to be elected to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for support for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by him to his current wife, Ashley, who is now Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI prepares the report?
The Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still not clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can garner at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a breakthrough from a slump in office and an election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has decreased under Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Integration, said 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and the price hikes demanded by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not publicly commented on this.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally offering South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them cross China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a heavily protected demilitarized area between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed to seek a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho blamed the sanctions on the United States.
“Without trust from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves,” Mr. Ri said in an address to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "characteristically unsuitable" for serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t think of anything else but to call a woman ‘hysterical’ if she behaved like that,” Kavanaugh told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh vehemently denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost yelling and suffocating in the discussion of his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the commission, calling the accusations against himself “grotesque and coordinated muddying” organized by the liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed to the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased towards Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself with statements like this and the way he handled Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if he is confirmed and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, for a moment.
“I’ll say this: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court, he’s inappropriate for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questioning whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t that wonderful?’” she said.
And a woman has to whip him.
It is a just outburst, after months and years of rage, and it cannot be expressed without weeping.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That doesn’t seem rare to me, does it?”
She continued: “I had a lot of help from a woman who was a director somewhere who was also crying when she was angry but developed the technique, and at the time she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you find me sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
Then she simply continued.
It seemed superb to me.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of my strongest memories from my early career, when I was still working in a male-dominated office, where I once found myself weeping in unspeakable rage, was when an older woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold leader who was always a little afraid to drag me down the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they beat you up.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the game, Mrs. Schroeder was deeply devastated to find that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me in laughter 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the game and one was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone called the game “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the latter joined the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the match if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave the men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in the conversation that she would not launch an official campaign, her emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – so overwhelmed her that she began to suffocate.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled the media’s reaction.
“You would think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone.
‘Did she cry?’”
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and while the battle has not been over long ago, experts say the split between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, triggered the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most important escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has always avenged itself with equivalent retaliatory measures, last with tariffs ranging from 5 to 10 percent on US $60 billion worth of goods.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to face the U.S. eye-to-eye and is unlikely to blink anytime soon.
In order for Washington to yield, China would have to agree to his demands, but it would be too embarrassing for the US to publicly bow to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Experts say that if Beijing can make the right move, U.S. pressure in a trade war could have a long-term positive impact on China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused expert at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to sanitize areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
The other six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning against the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems throughout most of the championship, threw the ball into the water at the 16th hole in the par-3 game in his initial kick, which forced him to hand the game over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of four players who have achieved a 5-0-0 score at any time since the start of the championship in its current form in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten by the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played the last time in the Ryder Cup.
Eight Ryder Cup veteran Sergio Garcia, with 25.5 points, became the most victorious European player of all time.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help it today.
This year was hard.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for raising me up and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so happy that we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The relay is handed over to compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud that I managed to beat Tiger Woods. As I grew up, I watched his games,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record in the 13-21-3 Ryder Cup.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find the right way all week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the championship.
The American captain, after a bad performance for his team, said: "I'm so proud of these guys, they fought."
In the morning, we put a little pressure on Europe.
We missed it.
Hat down in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Hats off.
They beat us.”
Red tide news: Concentrations off the coast of Pinellas, Manatee and Saratoga are declining
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
In the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Saratosa, Charlotte and Collier, the FWC reported more diffuse flowering, indicating a decrease in concentrations.
The red tide extends about 130 miles from the coast north of Pinellas County to the southern counties of Lee.
