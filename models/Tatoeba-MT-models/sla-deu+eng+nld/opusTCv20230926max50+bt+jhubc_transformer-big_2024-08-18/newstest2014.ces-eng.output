The black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are struggling to find money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that track every mile a motorcyclist drives and which transmit this information to the authorities are at the core of the controversial efforts of Washington and the state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing the US main roads.
Typically, poor highway design suddenly spurred intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
The libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbied for the government to use these small lockers to record mileage and possibly where you’re going – and then use that information to build a tax bill.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress cannot agree on whether to continue, some states are waiting for nothing.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system in which the driver pays for the kilometre of road on which he is driving.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“This is not a matter of choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking mileage for every Californian motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The stimulus is that the Road Trust Fund, funded by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars will travel a lot more kilometers per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise the tax even by a single cent.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test the pay-per-kilometer system.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers traveled.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change drivers’ behavior patterns, which, for example, can help reduce traffic congestion and greenhouse gas production.
California designers are looking at this system in planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster, chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market leaders from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for mileage.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project, which was supposed to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means to offend many kilometers for working outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the most ardent, with 5,000 drivers involved in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a mileage tax instead of a gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is exploring the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only advocates.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were equipped recently, drivers were concerned that the government was able to track their every move.
“The concerns about Big Brother surveillance and the like have been a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategy and traffic management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge cumbersome technological infrastructure, which will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find available technology that would allow the state to monitor how many kilometers the car will drive, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The hunt for such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
The company was originally not involved in an action to help the government tax drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market of legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device, which it tests, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and only delivers a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t keep track of their speed and their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
A number of major errors have occurred in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose a device with GPS or without GPS.
Or they don’t have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average mileage of all the state’s population.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will accept this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In the city of New York, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to additionally pay parking hours fees, to provide mileage insurance, and to collect speed data from other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to engage in this because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s projection document says.
However, some transport planners would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a huge substitute problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Transportation Metropolitan Committee say Congress could solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund very easily by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not consume much fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when you’re rich enough to take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the CSSD.
Social democracies are being snipped, people’s and grandmother’s are talking to each other and preparing a common course of action.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly coordinated partners, who will put a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts, on the table.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD envoys then either swallow the acidic coalition grapes or nod to the whirlwind minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka after four days, when he carried on the wave of sympathy, first came across.
Yesterday, he failed to dominate the political body and, above all, to force convicted liars to resign.
The confirmed negotiator for the party is only he, the other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CCE).
I apologised to the members of the assembly and now to the citizens.
You shouldn't lie, in your personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek after the meeting of the narrowest leadership of social democracy.
He added that he did not hold the position of first vice-president.
"I will report my decision to the ICJ on November 10," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach, the vice-president of the CSSD, and Jeronym Tejc, the head of the parliamentary club, also spoke similarly.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
Both MPs then declared that they would do everything to ensure that the 50-member club of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD sounded with one voice.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek put the crown on the absurd theatre with the sentence: "I have been a member of the CSSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
That's another lie in a live broadcast.
Or did he forget, when he called for Sobotka’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that the August ICJ decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the CSSD, however, by convening the <0xC3><0x9A>VV until next Sunday, produced a powerful army of enemies.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of the 192 members of this body and the media with a bunch of various gossip and rumors, possibly reminding of the real mistakes of Sobotka’s political career.
There will be powerful washing of dirty laundry, there will be hints of dark alliances between the coal baron Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and the wing of Sobotka.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes will erupt in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka’s ally, Peter Kainar, warned: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
Had the CEC met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
Traitors sprinkle ashes on their heads and stay.
And the currently victorious head of the CSSD then ends with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on the problems with the OH in Sochi: Communication with Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just breathes out deeply: "It's challenging."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the 2014 Sochi Olympics is a bit more complicated, according to Martin Doctor.
We can forget about what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same way," said the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, in terms of providing information on essentials, not so much.
For three months now, we have been working with them to tell us how the villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They communicate in many ways.
Is there at least an Olympic Village?
But it's not a catastrophic situation anymore.
A month ago, we walked around empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Do you need ready-made floors?
Just basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that when we arrive there on January 26 as a forerunner, he will still feel the glue there.
And if they didn't, what would they be?
Do you think President Putin would send an army there?
That's how it's gonna turn out.
Just so it's not that Olympic villages = Potemkin's villages.
They are more likely to fail, for example, to adjust the paths, do not complete the details.
Maybe they'll have their trips in such a state that we'll have to take our boots from the London Games with us.
But I believe they'll get it together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the figure skaters will ride in the three of them they left.
There is no need to doubt the speed skater Martina S<0xC3><0xA1>bl<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still waiting for the trip to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should be flying there until January 26th.
What will the houses in the Olympic village look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves with the subway, so that we did not believe only sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports, plus I am making a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin Promises Ecological Olympics, Plan Hits Huge Secret Landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a meter before the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking at their preparation with increasing concern.
The Russian Olympics, although it will not start until February, is facing another scandal.
Apparently, the Russians are not able to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the games will not disturb the nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
Indeed, after the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, the Canadian Games were recorded in the history of the Olympics as the most environmentally friendly.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for granted.
Reporters of the AP agency last week discovered a huge landfill of construction material in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities repented and the landfill disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a look at a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, there have been several in the area of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
Russian Railways, a state monopoly, is building a 60-kilometer route between Sochi airport and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was led by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways prevented the landfill from being set up by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to the residents of Achstyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around the village for three months, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymta, other streams and finally the Black Sea.
“Water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water sources for the next ten to fifteen years,” said Vladimir Kimayev, of the environmental non-profit organization EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem for the Russian organizing committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing cost $43 billion.
Last year’s games in London cost only 19 billion and the aforementioned Vancouver games nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not respected when working on the exhibition of sports grounds and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers will deal with a new law that bans the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple has matured to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy to both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was commissioned to design a house on a plot of land that lies on the corner of two streets, with the plot itself sloping somewhat.
The requirement further stated that the house would be inhabited by two generations who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each household on one of the floors of the house.
“When creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place.”
"Three different functions of the house are connected through several ways through the exterior of the building, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy," the designers explained.
The parents’ household is at the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in different finishes of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which has been shaped using panels of planks, the part where the office is located is plastered white, and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many of the walls of the house are completely glazed, which makes the interior of the house very intertwined with the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance for the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior underscores the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs to their premises.
The stairs are the main dominant feature of the interior of the house.
Their design allows a lot of natural light to cascade through them.
This is what the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and imprint something unique on it.
The household of the young couple is described as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
It is separated from the terrace only by a glass wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining area and kitchen in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs.
Defend academic freedom, this applies to the Earthman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, educators and the leadership of secondary and higher education institutions in several regions to defend academic freedom before the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at schools.
I have had more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the Honorary Chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, was even retaliated in the form of an invitation to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman's visit was made possible by: Brno University of Technology, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Ostrava University of Entrepreneurship, Business Academy in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, J.E. Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> University in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
Now we are meeting in Pardubice with the continuation of policy enforcement in universities.
The newly elected MP for the ODS, Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to resign from his academic post and, moreover, this seems normal to him.
Mr. Professor, it's really not the same as if you'd stayed in the mayor's office of a smaller town, for example.
Do you want to be one of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD leaders, who simultaneously forge the position of MP and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD leader and, like them, degrade both professions?
You are telling people that you can handle both of these challenging functions on the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, who can handle even several dozen functions at once.
This is not an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Fra<0xC5><0x88>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, who preferred to leave the parliamentary post, so that she could fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
However, the main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean is that you will violate the apolitical nature of the academic land of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the ODS in Pardubice sees your current role in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help "your" school even without remaining dean.
I think that your students will have the same opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may be possible for the voters to count you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry does not add to it
More than a thousand tons of sourdough will be produced in the coming months in Slov<0xC3><0xA1>ck<0xC3><0xA1> Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season started here in October and will last about six months.
Since 1925, healthy delicacies are still produced here in the traditional way, that is, by trampling directly in large tanks.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees find a 10-kilometer route for a shift.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage can fit in each of the ten tanks, one takes three shifts to fill," said David Kladroba, director of the Slov<0xC3><0xA1>ck<0xC3><0xA1> Fruta race.
Heads of cabbage are transported to the company's premises directly from their fields by farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
The staff of Fruta then cleans the vegetables, removes the chestnuts and throws them into the ring.
From here, the already cut cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, in which tirelessly work pedals dressed in white clothes and boots.
This displaces unwanted air.
The last crushed layer of cabbage is covered with a tarpaulin and loaded with water.
"The cabbage carrot then ripens for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," said Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production at home, the individual layers are sprinkled with salt and cumin.
Cabbage after fermentation goes to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweet-sour infusion into sachets or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
He is also interested in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower with U.S. intelligence, said he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Sträbele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, who was sent to the media by a Member of Parliament in Berlin on Friday, states: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as fugitives and tries to criminalize political speech with heavy lawsuits that do not give room for defense.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In that letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that support from the international community could persuade the United States government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to escalate when allegations surfaced that the NSA was tapping Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and destroying relations with the United States completely,” that should be done.
Mr. Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former contract lawyer for the NSA, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left one day.
If Mr. Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there, a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he faced a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world’s response to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the globe and senior officials — including those in the United States — have assessed the discovery of an unwarranted system of ubiquitous surveillance for public service.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities “until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved.”
We are sorry to kill, but we are innocent, say representatives of the Khmer Rouge
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
During the Khmer Rouge regime, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, starvation, disease, torture and executions, at least a quarter of the population at the time.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real scope of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Samphan said in court on Thursday.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The fact is that I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he never ordered the Khmer Rouge’s cadre to “mistreat or kill people, to deny them food or to commit genocide.”
But he acknowledged "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Che’s apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"She doesn't care about the others," she said.
"If he hadn't given orders, his subordinates wouldn't have killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The "Minister of Foreign Affairs" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, who died in March, was also expected to stand trial.
In September 2012, his wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found incapacitated by the court for dementia.
Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to impose a fee of up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday it said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
The new hand luggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if paying passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee should encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," she said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second pieces of checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and squeezed into the hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often a lack of space in that space.
Fees are one of the ways to teach passengers to take fewer things on board.
O'Malley said the purpose of this new fee is not really to raise more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the top storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the Frontier gate can bring luggage for which they will not pay anything, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same luggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be adjusted to ensure that passengers learn about the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage fee will not be valid until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the extra baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungarian Wizz Air, says air transport consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s hand luggage fee would bring in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit’s unusual hand luggage charge.
“Getting on the plane was the smoothest I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and quarrels at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the landing took place in an instant."
Frontier will also charge for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following Spirit’s example.
Frontier said passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the entire can and the coffee will be replenished free of charge.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to introduce drinks charges in 2008, but withdrew seven months later following complaints from passengers and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier’s last move to charge for hand luggage, if a passenger does not purchase a flight directly from the airline, is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them, instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier has gone the farthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile as part of a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for flying miles to 25 percent of the miles of the trip.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
According to the financial results announced on Wednesday, the company’s partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9% and transport capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter.
Republic is trying to solve Frontier’s financial problems with the sale of this airline.
The NSA does not blame hackers for the website crash, but an “internal error”
The secretive National Security Agency said last Friday that its website crashed for a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov website was not accessible for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the blackout was caused by a DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors noted that the NSA website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site remains unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information was compromised.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for dismantling NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood target web pages with information until the servers are overloaded and the page collapses.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
In recent months, the former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No such agency, has become the focus of public attention following the unveiling of foreign and domestic surveillance programs, and has been the target of gnawing criticism of the collective product of the NSA’s theft of secret files from the agency and their disclosure by a disillusioned former employee, Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the agency has been fueled by earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit collapsed due to a decline in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, driven by fewer orders and deliveries in the third quarter and contract issues in the train unit.
The Montreal-based Bombardier company also did not release any aerial test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to launch commercial operations from next September.
After the initial test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet estimates, and shares in the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8%.
State-owned bank analyst Cameron Doerksen downgraded the rating from “higher yields” to “sector performance” on Thursday, expecting the stock market to experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the transport sector has disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a statement.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect increased market scepticism about this program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will make their way into the bottom of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers await the results of the test flight in order to verify the company’s claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and obligations from 15 customers and operators.
Executive Director Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
The executives also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was proceeding as planned.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that the ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft’s shutdown.
Every manufacturer plans it differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updates and that’s what we did.
This will happen throughout the entire flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft should take off in the coming weeks, and the others not long after.
Analysts, however, are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier says it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – even though it’s in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be shifted to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover marginally fell from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a yield of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but low order receipts and overall market conditions have disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace industry fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled transport contracts accounted for $32.6 billion as of September 30, a marginal increase compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by the problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks would be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google CFO Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest competitor, announced a 10% drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned mobsters of police investigation is in jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to give information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer feared that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top-notch lawyer who informed a drug mobster about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to pass on sensitive information about his drug-smuggling activities after he became a suspected cocaine user to Underworld Chief Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer, whose nickname was "Bash" (party) and who was hailed by criminals as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he had represented in previous drug cases.
Police saw Sarborough, 32, leaving three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, his wallet, and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular A-Class drug user.
During a period of eight months, from January to August 2011, he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being investigated at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After a series of raids resulted in the police arresting around <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash, another 32 people were put in jail along with them.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals out of fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works for Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburn-based law firm, was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases before the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial.
During an earlier hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s fall came after Scarborough’s police investigation revealed that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place drugs of 60 percent purity under the lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was with Ditta, who was having dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, in a regular telephone conversation.
The lawyer returned home where he found the drugs, and nine interviews took place between the two people.
The court said there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls into “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he ran the office both at his home address and in the workplace, and that clients visited him at home for work matters.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, it contacted important players in the drug supply chain, some of whom it had previously represented, to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Who else is more aware that he must not violate the law than a criminal justice lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of misusing his position as a lawyer and of being in too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the normal lawyer-client relationship.
Police investigations were thwarted as much as possible to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring a good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he dishonored it.
He became too close to some of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta rejected the offense and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I’m not, and I wanted to give Mr. Scarborough information, I wouldn’t have expected 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately.”
After the hearing, however, police inspector Lee Halstead of Lancashire said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from a criminal defense attorney when he started getting drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of leading figures in organized crime groups who tasked him with gathering valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and must inspire public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The serious and organised crime unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, on the basis of which he was also convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine and now for obstruction of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bring the criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of association for the purpose of supplying heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five people involved in trafficking were imprisoned for a total of 153 years for drug offenses.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a guest at dinner he would wish for Muhammad Ali, and as a motivation for the work he cited inequality.
He negotiated the government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the people of Jan Kasal have sent against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The People’s Party won 14 deputies in the elections, which is only a third of the number of Social Democrats or YES representatives.
However, they enter into negotiations on the government with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who, under the people, adjusted the conditions of government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> do not have such a matador on their side.
Probably this time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates, as this year's talks will unfold.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
“This is a frightening news and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply sweeping away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is the extended arm of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs,” he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively gives the government “full control over the media” and the Standard newspaper reports that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “have taken a hard hit” and criticize the bill as “strict.”
The bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately following the September attack by an Islamic shooter at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned on the anger of the authorities when they broadcast a security camera recording of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly looting a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a media executive called for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn after pressuring the media.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of being "cut off the list" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to liquidate most radio stations.”
It is also said that these measures may have a liquidating effect on what is called Kenya’s “living blogosphere.”
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do whatever they want with impunity.
“You never know what could happen,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist for the Nation newspaper, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and collecting,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat salaries to around 532,000 tax-free shillings a month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
They have to save, the young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know what interest rates are.
More and more Czechs are taking their money away.
However, they do not reach the champions in saving in the region.
Most of the money is saved by Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros per month.
A little more than Czechs save even people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey by Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern European countries.
It also showed that the mood of the savers is improving, and two-thirds of the respondents plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the saving list, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of the saving products.
For example, almost every second Serb, according to the survey, saves himself at home "under the pillow".
This year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased in the country.
Last year, 26% of respondents put aside CZK 1,000 to 2,500 each month for various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly saving in year-on-year comparison fell slightly to CZK 2,078.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension supplementary insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents used it, compared to almost a quarter last year.
The survey also showed that although people consider it important to save, most of them do not know what revenue they are making on individual products.
Especially young people under 30 do not know how their money is interest-bearing.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, among people over 50, 73 percent of respondents know this.
In the international comparison of Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% distance.
The United Nations celebrates new goals in the fight against poverty
The United Nations is beginning to work urgently on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were introduced 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said overnight at the summit that now is the time to “rise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over a process to implement the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to fulfil our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambican security concerns escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Beneath the statue of Samora Machela, the founder’s president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to evoke peaceful slogans at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Out of fear for the future of her country, she traded her corporate clothes for a T-shirt decorated with the inscription “we demand safety” in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party, some of the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious insurgent movement, initially supported by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that an open conflict will break out in the country again, but recent events have frightened foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as the discovery of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could, over the next few years, bring in more than $50 billion worth of investment from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and America’s Anadarko.
The ruling party Frelimo, the dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party, on September 17.
Violent attacks by former rebels then culminated when government forces attacked a Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, a spokesman for Renamo Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of launching the conflict because he allegedly attacked the soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to ease concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama saw himself as a “mistaker” who wanted to use “anything he had left to try to prove that he could order the government to make his own decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But fears grew when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that the Renamo party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the Frelimo party no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease tensions between the parties, fuelled by a series of skirmishes this year.
It is a clash between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither is a good negotiator and neither is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections planned for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
The electoral share of the Renamo party has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr Mazanga says that Mr Guebuza - who is running out of office next year - wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“He doesn’t want a democratic system of multiple parties, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key north-south road.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week when the Renamo party threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, a slow pace of development, and a recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
The tales of Thor may show that “rough force cannot match clever cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Much of the myth would be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach at school,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates a careful selection of works appropriate to age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are like a “switch” in the engaging story with a “subliminal” message for children.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes the Penguin Book and the British National Tales, says: “You can have good intentions, but you’ll do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through a story, not openly defined.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno observatory will take visitors to space in a new digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can dive into the new comfortable seats, and over their heads added a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole device is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate an image," said the director of the Brno observatory, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classical personal computers," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k, a technician at the observatory.
The Digitarium can conjure up an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers find themselves in the middle of the universe or in the human brain.
Another similar facility is the closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project the purchased programs and their own creations in the hall.
There are two shows on the program since Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people learn about astronaut training, fly out into space, turn on a centrifuge, and then see how challenging the conditions of astronauts in space are.
The second program is for children and is called Magical Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitizer cost about 50 million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the observatory also contributed smaller amounts from their budget.
The projected area cost 10 million crowns, the projector 12 million.
"The rest was swallowed by audiovisual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The installation of the digital tower followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory went through two years ago.
According to Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, between 25,000 and 30,000 visitors could arrive by the end of the year.
We have studied 11 THOUSANDS OF INZERATS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job offers, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 ads (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet has become the most important medium for posting job offers.
Back in 2005, when the survey was conducted for the first time, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it settled at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example is a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published in a period of economic prosperity and in a time of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007 almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, compared to less than half in 2012.
The offer of jobs on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially a more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the offer of employment in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>stnov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The level of representation of selected professional groups varies between the two media.
On the Internet, the leading places were occupied by advertisements seeking managers and executives, sales representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or small business leaders appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, a large representation belongs mainly to the service and workers' professions.
The most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an advertising offer are, of course, education.
Other areas studied included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in 3% of advertisements, on the Internet in 37%.
Only two percent of job advertisements required an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for “computer literacy” appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the industry was required in 54% of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
The workers' professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added the author of the study Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner.
Employers also indicate in half of their advertisements the requirements for the characteristics and skills of potential candidates.
As the most frequently required skills, communication skills have appeared in advertising in the first place for a long time.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational skills and reliability.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival
It could be argued that the city of New York was the birthplace of a solo comedy performance in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Faye’s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and managed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the solo comedy institution Carolinas, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in the Carolinas and have become so successful that they are too big to play at the club," Hirsch said.
We have created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year’s festival came from unconventional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll snuck out with his sitcom (the hilariously spicy "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, but she is best known for her fast-growing video series Marcel the shell with shoes on.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surrealistly pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, an angry, racially oriented W. Kamau Bell), are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will be talking to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedic historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he would sometimes walk down the aisle between two buildings and say, "Man, if I lost all my money, maybe I'd live here."
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high inventories were balanced by a report that showed China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector was strengthening.
The U.S. oil indicator for December’s late-morning deliveries fell 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and fell by 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, stocks increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports of Chinese production came as a stimulus to higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen following growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London Stock Exchange.
Well, no, Mr. Hasch.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to exert such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of a political culture that is already so scarce.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends himself with the promise he made, but each and every politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and carefully consider what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He does not apologize in politics, he retreats in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, if you mean this well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me, so if you haven't just lied - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of the man who made the mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be seen as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, even if you are a misguided person, or you want to be a lifelong scout.
It may seem unfair to you to speak only to you, but you are the leader and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you're trying to turn your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit back and then attack again, but that's how partisans or scoundrels behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulation on the procedure of stopping and searching people by the police department in NY
The federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order demanding changes to the stop and search program at the New York Police Department and appealed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision would be postponed until the appeal decision was filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city challenged its findings and its corrective orders, including the decision to assign surveillance to help the police department change its practices and its training program associated with them.
The appeals court heard arguments for the requested delay on Tuesday.
The appellate court said the judge must be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the judge’s rules of conduct by failing to act as a judge to avoid the appearance of bias, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement in which she openly responded to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their program to stop and search people.
It established independent surveillance to oversee major changes including reform of procedures, training and surveillance, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body cameras in some areas where people are most often stopped.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the method of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
The oral justification for the city's appeal is scheduled sometime after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a stoppage and search of persons for about a decade, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg rose dramatically to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the stop and search program carried out by the NYPD say the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how other police departments use these practices.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale, not crime, and will waste money, but will not solve the broader problem of the police force under pressure after its numbers have dropped by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching people who are constitutional, but reformed the way the NYPD police department introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls suffer from low traffic
This is according to real estate consultancies Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w Shopping Centre will be opened to the public in Bohnice, Prague, and will be the 19th Prague Shopping Centre.
There are now a total of 90 large commercial centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are the inadequately large center relative to the location and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and unclear arrangement of passages, or dead places of the centers,” said Michal Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k from Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of retail real estate Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping centers are struggling with low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some of the projects opened almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly initially unsatisfactory.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
The new shopping malls need to make more efforts to ‘entice’ their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” added Samadi.
According to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even at some centers it is increasing, because the landlords were willing in the crisis to discount the rent and rent some units.
"But it is true that some projects have recently been opened that are not fully occupied and the average occupancy is thus reduced (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc)," added Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
Shopping malls opened in the last two years are advancing very slowly on the market, according to Sylvia Samadi.
There is a market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, the so-called ‘convinience centers’, aimed at shopping and day-to-day services for the population living in the immediate vicinity,” Samadi said.
Also, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, there is a place on the domestic market for other shopping centers.
Both for small 'service' centres and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities such as Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," added Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
In Prague, he sees the space for the upcoming shopping center on the Victory Square, further, according to him, they have a clear potential of Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop<0xC4><0x9B> street and Wenceslas Square.
"The expansion of retail parks is intensively developing, which allow retailers to cover and expand into ever smaller cities at favorable rental and operating costs, space is also still available in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, or their reconstruction, such as the reconstruction of Prior department stores, which benefit from a good location," added Dita Kubkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the Czech Republic there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leaseable area.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, there are nine in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic lags by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson hacked his phone to verify tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” methods to confirm a fraudulent love affair tip that was supposed to involve then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that News of the World caught fake news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and infiltrate her privacy, but the court heard Coulson called her and left her voicemails.
“The Attorney General suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a person standing outside the house hoping to catch people out there, but a person who likes to push people’s stories to see what they say,” he said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, tracking and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
She obviously knows about the other, the surveillance, she needs to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
Rumors of a love affair involving Clarke were first captured by the NotW newsroom when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, “You’re just wasting your time, she’s with Charles.”
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the private investigator’s computer, where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
“During the time Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about Pawlby,” Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup oversaw Mrs Pawlby's movement.
Coulson left her a voice message on June 18, 2005, telling her, "I've got a story we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles about it."
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story was the same as that of other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
In court on Thursday, it was reported that Coulson confronted Mr. Blunkett over an affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collaborating with others for the purpose of hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck, and Weatherup confessed to breaking into the phone.
NSA Discovery Increases Social Paranoia of State Surveillance
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
At the direction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media claim that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of listening antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign minister in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, reiterated that the United States was not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies, thereby enhancing their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant, began unveiling his valuable collection of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and business leaders no longer know if they should believe the director’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on a Brazilian oil company and gained access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, general paranoia about state surveillance has reached new proportions.
The last straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been eavesdropped for perhaps ten years.
If the target can be the most powerful person in Europe, then surely the leading entrepreneurs are also a potential target.
Snowden has made clear the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey published in July by the EY advisory service, German companies believe that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much a risk as China.
However, there is still no evidence in all of Mr. Snowden’s documentation that the United States has passed trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacked some IT and Internet capabilities and said it should seek to reduce its dependence on the US:
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
In the German parliament, there are voices saying that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
That’s not the way to go, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking to some companies who so far believed China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a big turnaround in cloud computing, where European leaders have come to realize on a broader scale that data stored in the U.S. falls under U.S. jurisdiction and is therefore potentially questionable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of non-US members have canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after the discovery of the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“It’s been a major topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly during the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s agrochemicals company.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Generally, business leaders do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory stick at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been a common practice for many years to collect cell phones before a board meeting so that they can’t be used as a listening device.
The German BfV is advising executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones abroad due to the risk that smartphones can be embezzled.
Prepaid mobile phones are then thrown away.
However, there is concern that SMEs will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are at the forefront of the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimates in February listed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of perpetrators involved in hacking activities for economic reporters, just behind China.
A board member at a German risk-free company concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of France’s internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia's Underage Boy Who Died in Strange Accident Believe He Was Murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a twisted wrestling parlor at his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found stuck in a straightened-out spirit behind the stands at the gymnasium he attended on January 11.
Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy refuses.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and to common sense,” Crump said.
They believe this is to cover up what really happened to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back to them in a body bag," he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for a routine investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated Johnson had died as a result of “positional suffocation.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, indicated another cause of death.
"There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson’s death for an order to investigate a crime or a violation of civil rights, he will ask the FBI to execute it.
The deputy sheriff's office at Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to make available all the surveillance cameras that investigators had viewed.
The teenager’s parents hope the videos will contain a clue to how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the US government, due to the fact that the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about childhood food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction if it occurs.
It also recommends that schools have access to adrenaline – most commonly an automatic EpiPen injector – to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State legislatures have recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, “It’s like someone’s punching my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is itchy.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “unspecified sex”
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with ambiguous sex.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to indicate any gender for such children, and allows them to indicate gender on their birth certificates as "unspecified" or "unspecified".
The aim of the law is to stop pushing parents to make a hasty decision for their child to have sex-specific surgery, and to fight discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a doctor-made saliva, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that out of 2,000 children, one is born every year, which is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, an umbrella term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Gender determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that if it is not possible to determine gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, instead of waiting and monitoring the psychological and physical development of the child until the operation is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
The determination of gender can be done without surgery, and then one can wait as the identity develops.
Knowing how a child develops sexual affiliation is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically consists of both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These traits can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, bust and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys of no gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to label male, female or “third sex” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “non-sexual” person in June when she won a court appeal to keep her status as an “unspecified” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will have, in addition to M (male) and F (female), a third designation, X, for intersex people.
In neighboring France, according to a report on France 24, the issue of gender is still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The Catholic online website also defined itself against German law and wrote: “As the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a matter of choice but sexual activity is not, we are overturning two other pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn from Maryland also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the children be given sex at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children of both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek who had a double sex.
And about ten years back, the medical community believed that gender was something like a whiteboard that could be erased and redrawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation, with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how children will feel when they grow up due to their gender.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these babies were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
The persistent theory of how to treat children with ambiguous sex was put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is submissive.
He created a new concept of “sexuality” and argued that social causes and environmental influences—as parents raised their child—affected children’s genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether he was identified as male or female.
But in one case in 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
The parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to poorly performed circumcision, recommended that their child be completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he had his surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "use this model" to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared "dissatisfied with the result".
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but ambiguous sex organs.
Doctors weren’t sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they believed that as a man he could never live a “satisfying life.”
Shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from his outer organs and testicles and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask.
At 18, he was sent for vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was frightening.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his sex drive.
After learning the truth, he turned back into a man, took testosterone doses and had his breasts removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, it represents others in the organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for labeling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will achieve the goal of encouraging parents to make quick decisions and choose the ‘uncertain’ for the child,” she said.
We are afraid that this will encourage intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don’t know how the law will end up, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex,” she said.
German law intends to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that at this moment a small child should not seduce.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with sexual dysfunction and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said German law would “give authority” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because its androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
He has a vagina, but he has no uterus and no ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and, as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania, she works as an intern in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and change their mind, and it gives them time to write “husband” or “wife.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don’t have to rush into an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they’re not sure they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which sex he identifies with more – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunk man poured gasoline on the whole house: he threatened to set fire to it with his own family!
Tension increased, fear escalated.
The man threatened to burn down the entire house.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as the fire department from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and the unit of the volunteer fire brigade, departed.
A police negotiator came to the scene, trying to talk the man out of his irrational behavior.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
An emergency unit had to break into the house, disarming the men and cuffing them.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav hospital, from where he was taken to an anti-alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the house with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to people, all the animals were also rescued from the house.
The man didn't give up on the police negotiator, so the commando followed him.
Obama's campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton
According to the New York Times, Obama’s closest adviser was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden as Hillary Clinton’s 2012 nominee.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, Double down: Game Change 2012.
The Times obtained a copy of the incoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top collaborators had organized intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to assess whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hopes of re-election.
According to the Times’ national-political correspondent, Jonathan Martin, the book provides a thorough record of the efforts of senior campaign officials and the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure the impact on the election of former Secretary of State Clinton’s move to the post of vice president.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew this change was being considered.
The book “Double Down” claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make the move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidacy would not significantly increase “Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've been researching a lot of things, and this was one of them," he told Daley.
You must not forget that at the time the president had terrible prospects, so we thought, “Christ, what are we to do?”
While Daley characterized the research as “due care,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily to see if the election move was worth it.
“There is no money spent on elections and qualitative research in campaigns unless something is seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential mixing of cards.
While Daley said he did not think the president was “conscious” of potential changes, the former head of the office admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double Down" does not definitively answer the question of whether the political probe got to Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the research regarding Biden’s removal from the list.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
A fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this sea animal and developed a luminous treat.
He came up with the idea when he read an expert treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes luminosity.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lie, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick me I’m delicious”, says: “It’s an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we’re at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2g of that substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We’ve tested it over the last few months and it seems like a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
And so every hill costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product will be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd really like to make an invisible ice cream."
At its core, it's impossible because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I'm counting on us to find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I could eat sweets, stay up for a long time and show our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a caretaker.
For two years there was no candy in my apartment and this year it will probably not be different.
However, the statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year — 158 million of them in fact — and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and ornaments.
What I’m always looking forward to about Halloween, though, are the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year, the latest fashion highlights are sexy inanimate objects.
It doesn’t have to be just women; foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots can also be sexy.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the Dead Parade, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will reach out to our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suppose there's nothing wrong with following tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we’re not wasting time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey tables, lollipops, Milk Duds and Twizzlers candy, and Clark bars.
This is amazing news for the 41 million carolers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhood.
In fact, we buy, believe me, 45 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want is corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Candy Stores, almost 16,000 tons of them are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never cracked.
Nothing is more typical of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls" (Horror behind the walls, which is a real prison by the way), "Howl-O-Scream" (crying, roaring) and "The house of shock" (House of Shock).
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that, according to American Horror Houses, make a profit of $500 million, and that includes those amazing photos that you’re scared of and that your friend puts on Facebook and you can’t remove them and the person you like will look at the picture and post a comment like, “Come on.”
And finally, a little about pumpkins.
Already when we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the trend of “baby in a pumpkin” started only last year thanks to the Pinterest app, so most of us grew up on the fact that we carved pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flashing flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California and try cutting their almost one tonne of pumpkins.
Land Rover Racing Series Announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as intercommunication devices.
You can choose from improved brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between races.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world-class races.
We are pleased to offer them this journey in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the hardness and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last ones, he said in an interview with Aktualno.cz that there is no other way out, and every government that came out of the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last that long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, who estimates the lifespan of the opening term to be two years.
Contrary to the fact that voters are unlikely to choose a completely different one next time, they disagree: "I think it will be a bit more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the president of the TOP 09 does not admit that his party may lose voters in the next elections as this year (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it was clear within two months that there would be an early election, it would strengthen the YES 2011 movement of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where Chairman Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of a part of the party leadership, said that either he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek would remain in the leadership of social democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own way:
"Leaders of the Democratic Party, like little boys, follow the head of state to allow them a coup in the party."
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I have never seen anything so badly done in my life," added the TOP 09 chairman.
And toward President Zeman (whom he clashed with in the fight for the presidency) he scoffed: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to seize that party."
The first draft of the TOP 09 has already been introduced.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
The TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first draft laws to the House, including the Faroese Treaty Register, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The President of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktualno.cz says that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 clearly wants to overtake similar attempts from other parties.
For example, the election leader of the ANO movement, Martin Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek, accused TOP 09 in the election campaign of the idea of introducing a register of contracts "robbing" the program of the ANO movement.
TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it just dusted off the proposal, which was already on its way to the second parliamentary reading.
Firefighters arrive to rescue a lost puppy trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was seen in a quarry by a man who had taken out a dog.
Firefighters swarmed over the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by firefighters who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and he survived alone for three days until he was freed from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After running away when he got into a small accident, feverishly they searched for their lost dog and posted challenges on social networks.
At about 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-sighted dogman spotted a trapped Ruby on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and landed downstairs to free Ruby, using an animal transport bag to pick him up on the rock.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team’s expert commander, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and bottom.
He didn't move his eyebrow during the rescue - he was completely frozen.
But he's fine now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team’s expert commander, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a checkup, and apart from exhaustion and dehydration he was fine.
Miss Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I looked at the rescue operation.”
First of all, I couldn’t believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The vet said that if he was too exhausted and collapsed, he would probably fall.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We just don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says Katy Perry, 18, didn’t make it.
During an interview for an Australian radio show, the pop star said this week that she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
She added, “That was a long time ago, and now he’s very nice to me.”
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's 70-year-old deputy said he categorically refused to ever make Katy Perry's proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe you're confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scotland a choice
Another day, another scary story about independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for the membership of an independent Scotland in the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks at Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as one would expect – this was not reflected in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States spend a lot of time adjusting their official laws if they like.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever the Scots really want.
So it's a pretty weak story.
And so old that it became a dig, a journalist duck that “independence means passport control,” I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet there is an interesting idea in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe?
Why should we exchange London for Brussels, especially now?
This is a true European story: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resisting the EU or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already took almost five million votes in the federal elections in September, essentially sweeping the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
At home, there has always been resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a conspiratorial cage tied to national economies by clinging to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments manage a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates advantageous for German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way to do this is to cut revenues and public spending – and that is what Germany is calling for.
Behind the current problems with the budget and the currency is the deeper cause of Europe's malaise performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Even any wage freezes in the world would not stop Europe’s petrochemical industry from choking on cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a suffocating revolt, especially in France, once enthusiastic supporters of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany in check and allow Paris to stand up to Washington in the world.
Berlin, however, no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and it has enforced its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
Result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won a major re-election and pushed the ruling Socialists to third place.
With 24% of the vote, the front is now France’s most popular party – a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot deduce that the splitting of the right will automatically have a positive effect on the left.
How does Le Pen deal with her newfound popularity among the white working class?
She would like to use the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament, acting against the common currency.
If the anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
At the same time, I suspect that in the near future the growing anti-European sentiment and attitude towards the common currency will unite and the euro will be destroyed.
The EU will not disappear, but rather be transformed into something more free in the sense of a “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and join the United States.
But Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when they should leave us alone.
I assume that Scotland would have done well in the relaxed order of Europe, provided that it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take an example from Norway and retain our economic independence.
Surprisingly, the SNP government in Scotland is the most successful non-austerity political movement in Europe, which won by a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against the cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Developed earlier
Research has shown that African-American and Hispanic women reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching
It has not been proven that there are hormones or other chemicals behind it.
Experts say that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be the obesity epidemic.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be terrified when her daughter starts to grow breasts and hair on her shame at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatric Physicians this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this was not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
Over the past 40 years, however, there has been only a slight shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years, compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will take at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
There is debate about what triggers the real onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered “premature.”
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are medical procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and stiffness in adulthood.
Recommendations for medication and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the speed of development, the speed of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but admits that “puberty suppression can alleviate the girl’s behavioral problems and feelings that she is different from her peers.”
Another big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried that she might get pregnant, or how she'll handle her hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter began menstruating at age 10.
Although there were hints and we talked about menstruation, she wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys – like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious cause is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic women tend to reach puberty before their white counterparts.
Explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although boys experience facial hair and shame at a young age, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is for girls.
Other physicians attending the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) conference added more complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the real onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It may mean having to talk to the child sooner than you think," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your baby will probably respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> in the role of a pub.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> (62) appeared behind the bar in the role of a pub and she was very good at it.
Would a favorite Czech actress plan to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and was drinking beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even my boss offered to hire me and I could feed myself by turning beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do to this day, with acting," said Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1>, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer, and I'll have Irish whiskey there," the actress said.
A long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD> also appeared at the event.
I'm dead, and in this new life, I can't drink.
I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I’m trying to do that,” he added.
Aircraft manufacturers argue over seat width, big contracts at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a dispute broke out over the width of the second-class seats on long-haul flights, which this month gave rise to a bitter exchange of views on the air show in Dubai.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for economy-class long-haul flights – not exactly the one that would normally be preceded by airlines, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency requirements for the last aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but major US rival Boeing says airlines should decide.
The dispute arose as aircraft manufacturers competed in the sale of the largest version of their two-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is arranged – especially whether there are 9 or 10 seats side by side – is the basis of economic performance requirements for the design of the new mini-jumbo aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will transport 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out over 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 will transport 350 people in 46 cm wide economic seats spread out over 9.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
He recently previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people crammed into a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus sales manager.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats in airplanes have not changed radically.
From the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, to the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of an average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims its rival adheres to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average seat width of the newly baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests an extension of the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the dimensions of Airbus’ seats and says it has no jurisdiction over aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines balance fees and equipment.
The company also says the research shows that the cabin experience depends on more things than just the seat width.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do things they believe they need to do to be successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, more space for elbows is essential, but for suppliers, it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this dispute is a race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade value of at least $700 billion in catalog prices in the coming decades, enough to sway the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 percent more efficient than the market leader in the segment, the Boeing 777-300ER with 365 seats, in their latest two-engine long-haul aircraft designs.
The performance requirements of Boeing depend in part on the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seater concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to inflate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus Europe’s chief passenger comfort officer.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are in line with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A forty-five-centimetre-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft layouts for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for more cab modification by offering wider seats in the alleys on some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of a single additional manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard of, but may discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded 1000 in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121 and in 2010 there were already 180.
Last year, 212 were infected and this was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year there were 165 HIV patients in the country, this year there were 176 in the same period.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
There were 206 infected people living in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian Region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian Region or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The least contaminated people came from the Highlands, there were 19.
A total of 88% of patients became infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. for more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, and it was transmitted from their mother to them.
Gravity is nonsense, but the view is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over CZK 26 million.
Most reviews evaluate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, although it looks like a "physically real" performance.
It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You can see Sandra Bullock's hair, which somehow does not float in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving in vastly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in a single image.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and in general the whole behavior of fire in a state of weightlessness.
They said the suits wouldn't have been able to withstand such wounds.
The heroes in the film Gravity often get into collisions with various objects and suits without much difficulty everything will endure.
Criticism was not spared even the plot plot.
Such a large-scale tragedy in the orbit of the Earth is, according to some debaters, unrealistic.
In addition, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
On the forums, people also argue about the "unreal" behavior of lan.
It looks like it’s meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (director of the Astronomical Observatory and Planetarium of the capital city of Prague): I have only seen it on a wide canvas so far, but I can definitely say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has the right (almost the duty) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the discrepancies you mentioned, I was touched by the way the space station with the degrading level of technology (the last Chinese) is shown three times."
“China, after all, will be at the end of the decade and probably look better than it is in the movie.”
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors try very successfully not to violate the laws of physics, and so the naturalist-oriented viewer appreciates that during various cosmic collisions and collisions, the moment of momentum is quite correctly preserved, said in the dictionary of physics, also the view of the Earth from space is very real.
Inconsistencies will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, when reading the comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of the circulation of various space debris in orbit appears in some scenes to be reversed than it should actually be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n (employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted by the creators to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and heavenly sin against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is clear that the creators have taken care of the credibility shown.
Of the moments that do not make sense, it is worth naming the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different inclined orbit than the ISS.
As a result, the speed of each other is very different, and the rescue operation could not actually take place as it was shown in the film.
Further, at the time of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is no clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
New nicotine vaccine could take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing on humans, more tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first indications are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their addiction to nicotine is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry genetic information to form anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests of vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “calm down,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine got into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be given as often as possible to maintain sufficient levels of antibodies, so they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower as it converts liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they would like to try a cigarette, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, smokers are more likely to use it to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get any benefit from the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this bad habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but cautioned that more research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the state corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the policy of coastal leases at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
On Friday, the Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied for several state ministers to have his lease on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a cafe, renewed without having to participate in a tender after it expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating allegations that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's covert interests in these properties, based on evidence presented Thursday by Lynne Ashpole, former deputy head of Mr Tripodi's office.
During the years of talks launched in 2005, the government pushed for rentals to go into public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer-term contract terms.
In 2009, leases for Circular Quay businesses, which earned the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public tender.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
A transcript of calls submitted to the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the ports department after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the subject of the conversations during these telephone calls the development of a commercial rental policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
'No, 'said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not this.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes strike target in Syria, senior official says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikiya on Thursday night, a senior administration official told Fox News.
The official did not specifically say what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on missile shipments in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
The commentator of Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka, for example, spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the chairman of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was stirring up a quarrel.
Heytman Chovanec was suspicious of me as soon as he was elected to the Bureau, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s misery.
The rest of the men showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and useless, Vice-President Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek was the most excluded by the conversation on television.
Based on this, I do not see a better option than for the CSSD to propose for the Prime Minister the Vice-President of the Senate Gajdushkova, the only one would not have an initial handicap and I think she would perform the standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone from the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> could safely form a minority government with a mere blessing from President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the People’s Party, but with the People’s Health Minister Govorka, who is actually a religious Social Democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability, as it would have pushed for a proper referendum law, and the President of the Dawn of Okamura has pledged to support it.
In the end, President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would accept the tax progress, because he is smart and he will see that it cannot be done without her.
Humans would not bring trouble, because Call is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they would not be in government.
The same is true of YES, and there would be a valuable minister here too, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but they will provide support, also well.
Let's give Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> courage!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may be subject to the “authority” test
As the government intends to expand police interventions, it is considering a “legitimacy” test for foreign workers with a visa permit 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unqualified jobs, or as a back door for moving family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion article was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant from the time when unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white labor force had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in the region noticed the echo of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to negotiate with officials over human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes and others remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are accepted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking’.
Following previous experience with businesses that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds, businesses may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has died of a suspected heart attack after arriving on an asylum boat to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man's nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia with him, and after his father's death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities and a man rushed to a hospital in the Christmas Islands, where he died.
The British government has announced a study that aims to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase starts in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring the UK together”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about working with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which has held talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to determine further rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave the SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it’s also about connectivity – 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will be better connected across the UK thanks to HS2.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unequivocally" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed track has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds economic weight to Scotland’s overall high-speed rail case across Britain.”
We are therefore enthusiastically working with the British Government to explore the possibilities of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland and thus bringing benefits to all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers over the next year and to taking joint decisions on the next steps.
Together with Barta, inspections and anti-corruption police analysts were arrested
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the news was brought by the server Prv<0xC5><0xAF>zpravy.cz.
MF DNES soon found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS), its people were to arrest B<0xC3><0xA1>rta in the center of Prague.
It happened outside the Four Seasons Hotel.
The inspection deals with cases where there are police officers among the accused, but its competence also extends to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police is Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of analysts and informatics.
He worked for the Security Information Service in the past.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, declined to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
However, her inspectorate spokeswoman, Radka Sandorov<0xC3><0xA1>, did not want to say anything about the case, but immediately referred to the Municipal Public Prosecutor’s Office in Prague.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.
It can also be inferred from this unspecified reaction that the event took place, but it is under a regime of secrecy that does not allow speakers to say anything specific.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Barta "even in this matter", but given that this is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Barta's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart’s arrest might be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted to the post by B<0xC3><0xA1>rta together with the former chairman of the VV Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that broke out between the former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV even had to be resolved by the then President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection came from.
No one contacted me, I was not questioned.
"I really don't know anything about it," said iDNES.cz Lessy.
In January 2011, Lessy became chief of police.
Officially, he was promoted by Radek John, but the real leader of the party was Barta at the time.
Barta was now running for election for the Dawn Movement, his parliamentary mandate narrowly escaped him - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what was going on.
"Vit Barto was one of the many candidates on many of our candidates and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not or is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from Barto Okamura, who said before the election that he had given Barto the space to run for the Dawn because he had helped him solve the problem of executives.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta appeared in court in 2012 with his former partner from VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>rka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-offs and landings, regardless of changes in the U.S. to ease regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies the space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases if the devices remain in “air” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they cannot access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical stages of flight are still in force in Australia.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices on aircraft,” he said.
This issue is covered by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about extending the use of its on-board entertainment system Wi-Fi, was in favour of the change but announced that it would comply with a regulatory decision.
“We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have [wireless onboard entertainment], it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices must not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory field that may be useful for our passengers, and we are sure to study the FAA’s decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of U.S. airlines, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew orders passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in the storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing poverty of the middle class, pawnshops in Singapore are thriving
At a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga stops a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s tuition fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 ($3,000 SGD) each month as an administrator and her husband also works, the family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across regions in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman carries out her transaction, has become the third-ranked stock market in Singapore this week.
Stopping jewelry isn’t just a quick way to borrow cash — 1,300 SGD in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga — but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Pawnshops in Singapore typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a person’s verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
As families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops.
After five years of massive growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by loose monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households mainly because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, which is an increase from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also worried about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from medium to low [income] will try to replenish their income wherever they can,” said Song Song Wun, an economist at Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people hurriedly stopping their personal possessions and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewellery for cash.
About 70 percent of the items pawned in 200 city pawnshops are gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshops in recent months.
The growth in the pawnshop sector is so great that ValueMax, the operator of a branch in Bendemeer and 15 like it in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it acquired on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly raise the debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal property does not increase household debt,” he says.
In society, asset pledges are increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secure financing.
Among those who use pawnshops, moreover, not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy Singaporeans also use ValueMax branches to stop gold bars or Rolex watches, and can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all kinds.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing because of their daring trades or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contain harsh conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Health Minister Tanya Plibersekov said Australia is taking “accelerated measures” to address the crisis caused by the island’s aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
The funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state," Plibersekov said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for surgery at the patient’s request.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help relieve indebtedness.
The money is also available in open clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are responding to ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian health care system,” Plibersekov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and registration obligations.
The state will have to maintain its current level of funding to receive the money from the Australian Union, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless “until there is real reform to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised in talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package will be able to free the state public health service from a critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal opposition health spokeswoman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just a patch.
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and the Australian Union that gives away 300 million dollars, and pretend it's good news.
Mr Dutton urged Mrs Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted Denis Diderot's novella, which brings an extraordinary film journey and a rendition of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in France in the 1860s, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery by her family.
When he rebels, he experiences the extreme cruelty of a punitively perverted mother introduced, and for another becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to greed or sensationality, and that’s his problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience torment similar to wearing a linen shirt.

Syria Destroys Its Chemical Weapons Production Facilities, Says Surveillance Authority
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent conflicts erupted in the country's north, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before 1 November,
the deadline set by the Hague-based organisation for Damascus to destroy or disable all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of producing poisonous gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this essentially initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira, which experts say is the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and storage facilities, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday.
A group of activists monitoring the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There will be 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
There are 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Hezbollah militants on the government’s side.
Among the dead are 2,202 government defectors and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels in Safir, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The watchdog said on Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, on a mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team is now “satisfied that it has verified – and monitored – the destruction of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/completion.”
He added that “no additional control activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit the two sites due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “left behind and ... chemical weapons items that it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had,” said Ahmet Uzumcu, director of observers, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawi sect, a branch of Shiite Islam, are fighting each other in a civil war.
Regarding further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said that there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikiya on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict handed down over the founder of the bombing in Bali
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the verdict handed down over the last of the founders who were brought to justice and said that Umar Patek was to be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for assembling explosive devices used in a bomb attack.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, leaving 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other counts of terrorism, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, even though it could insist that a man nicknamed "Demolition Man" be given the death penalty because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders almost a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For AAP, Ms Corteen said: “It should be placed in front of an executioner’s platoon.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see other grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was leveled when a heavy charge was detonated on the outside of a parked van shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma on the moon, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the three other members of the Jammu Islamiyya terrorist cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the attackers in Bali.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where less than four months later U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to reestablish ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt pity for how much grief he has caused to others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technology on planes (but not call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, FAA administrator Michael Huerta told a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated on-board training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are currently required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They can't turn it on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn off their equipment again when the plane crashes to land and not turn it on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference can allow their passengers to use their devices during take-off, landing and commuting, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are implemented safely – and we will work closely with transport companies – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we’re tired of looking like “watchmen.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending emails and text messages or downloading data will continue to be banned below 3 kilometers of altitude, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will still have to be stored out of fear that they could hurt someone if they flew around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not determined by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Committee on Transport Safety, a national security expert on transport at CBS News, said that mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but we also know from FCC data that they can cause interference in the air to broadcast towers,” Rosenker said.
A sector advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow more widespread use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that as many as a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to interference from navigation and communication equipment, as passengers began to carry with them FM radios, a technical outpost of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio transmissions than they did with previous generations of devices.
For example, e-readers issue only minimal broadcasts when the page is turned.
But broadcasting is more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those who are pushing for the release of restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle electronic readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether these facilities posed any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passenger Association said he believed the disruption from these devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only fragmentary reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the device during low-visibility flight.
The Travel Industry Group welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable move for the travel public to make extensive use of the technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not inconsistent with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by air from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One rattlesnake was taken to Aberdeen by helicopter last month after being treated by the Scottish rescue company SPCA until he recovered.
Operating center Colin Seddon said: “This rattle probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently, he ran out of power and found refuge on the oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help.”
By the time the snoring was released, he was in good shape and in good health.
Is the European elite ready for trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to merge businesses and define what changes the UK entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we have entered the largest and most comprehensive survey, in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and are focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government prioritize new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than getting stuck in a long and laborious process of reforming Europe’s mysterious institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and entrepreneurs said that the cost of Brussels regulations now outweighs the benefits of being part of the European trade area – as much as 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European company, agreed.
Finally, our survey of business leaders revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek a treaty change and a relationship with the EU that should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, shared by businesses of various sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a “sense change” that will bring the impact back to Britain.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better deal for Britain could mean a profit of up to 16% when voting in a referendum on staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business sector expects this amendment to mark a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and as the eurozone sets out on its way to a closer economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for business this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach of Brussels.
John Kerry admits spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, US Foreign Secretary John Kerry said during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, the collection of information was used to deter terrorist attacks.
The “first confession from Washington,” according to AFP, came amid fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the US National Security Agency (NSA), whose targets were also American allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President Obama did, some of these actions have gone too far and we assure you that they will not happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended his previous practice.
Information gathering is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent assassinations, such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid, March 2004 attacks, and the London, July 2005 attacks.
“We prevented planes from crashing, buildings from exploding and people from being killed because we were able to be informed of the plots in a timely manner,” Kerry said.
However, he once again admitted that the collection of information “in some cases went disproportionately far.”
A U.S. intelligence scandal that allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls erupted in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also monitoring the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their indignation, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexei Miller from Gazprom says that the pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction has begun on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “forever” eliminated.
As soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is set to begin in other countries in the flow direction at the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
Lebanon's Hezbollah has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous region of Kalamun.
Israel has reportedly destroyed missiles targeted by Hezbollah in two airstrikes in western Syria on Wednesday.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the Syrian army.
Its program is also the fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but clearly said that it would prevent the transfer of weapons to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria on Wednesday are yet to be clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but it was confirmed by US sources.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla missile base south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station said two warehouses were hit, where the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, it was a Russian-made SA-8 rocket.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria was constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles, and the Syrian air force was teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an obsolete missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with radar, which turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area, and Hezbollah has been involved in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community, of which the Al-Alawites belong.
Now, 15,000 of its fighters are reportedly ready to help the army retake Kalamun.
Together with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its troops there.
Kalamoon lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
The battle is supposed to be a retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army fight back the city of Kusair near the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the insurgents from Kusair went to Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
The reasons were corruption, waste of money for overpriced purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens were satisfied with this situation.
That they did not really care and with the state that was there (theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not come to the polls, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
That is the vast majority.
If to the above parties add 1,016,829 voters of the CSSD, then with the old order (because all the above parties participated in the "robbery" and debt of this state), then 64,23% of eligible voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of voters showed that they are not in favor of punishing the culprits of plunder and over-indebtedness of this state.
Or do you think that the members of the CSSD, who participated in this, will push for appropriate laws?
Is there anything we can do to help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) were indicted before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before the charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Young Men’s Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were accused of child sexual abuse.
But the commission said in its introductory statement to the commission that the association had never addressed a child sexual abuse case in its organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which one of the YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a YMCA gymnast in Caringbah was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gaili Furness, an advisor to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not about the second.
He admitted that the initial statement of YMCA was also inaccurate when it stated that external audits were carried out at YMCA, which appreciated the organization as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence presented by the Commission indicates that YMCA was notified that it received the second lowest of the four possible ratings in an August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that the downward guidance had failed from him when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure staff were aware of the obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually abusing 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting violations of children’s safety by Mr. Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they had witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, privately guarding them, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was worried about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to talk to."
The CEO said he did not accept evidence from staff that they felt unwell if they were to contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord had obscured their judgment, and therefore they had not reported the problem.
Mr Hare said he told the YMCA Council in New South Wales that the lessons learned from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization were that the staff “did not report” and the council agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by YMCA’s General Manager for Children’s Services Liam Whitley.
He said the aim was to avoid distortion of the evidence, but it was “overly ardent” and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, an expert on child sexual abuse at Griffith University, told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, recruiting, training, and directing personnel.
The hearing was adjourned to December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that a return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years in leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided discussions about British politics and has limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as an ambassador for the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, London’s Evening Standard newspaper said: “Yes, of course, but it’s probably not going to happen, right, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to compete for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only took his first steps a few months ago, this little boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly slipped through three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by Sunnybank Riding Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circle.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March, and he has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are great collaborators.”
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal, and strangers wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells says, “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone cheered and applauded.”
He ran on the sand along the entire length of the arena, and although he seemed so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has taken care of two chickens.
Given how he started, he will be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon and I’m sure he will do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “There are only three Fentons, but they already know how to control a pony.”
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent performance and the way they performed on the circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and who runs it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's adorable outfit helped, and he really fit in with it.
Too Curious Newspapers to Be Investigated
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page asked for the release of a reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
New Express newspapers based in Guangzhou made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to make up stories about a partially state-owned company.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now make a “full correction”.
The order for "correction" came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in the province of Kuang-tung.
A preliminary investigation revealed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about Zoomlion.
“The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly,” the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of a journalist’s license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out an overall correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the responsible persons in the New Express and immediately change the leadership of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed to be behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false stories for a fee.
“In this case, I caused damage to Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told state-run CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realize I did wrong.
After Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued an apology on the front page, stating that he had failed to check his reports.
Recently, several highly-watched suspects made a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year’s change to the law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
US-Mexico drug smuggling tunnel found with its own railroad
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico was discovered, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
The U.S. authorities have described a tunnel measuring about one by one metre as one of the most ingenious secret passageways they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is full of vague warehouses, where trucks can easily be hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men, who according to authorities worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of convictions, they face imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers infiltrate vast drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 meters long equipped with tracks that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center are linked by management.
They offer, for example, joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n, Prague.
Economia has taken the next step to transform the Centre Holding into its media house.
Since Friday, Economia and the Centre have shared top management.
"The unification of the organisational structure and the personnel union are crucial for the integration of both publishing houses into the joint media house," comments the Vice-President of the Board of the Economy and the Commissioner-General Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
<0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k, who will lead the unified management, will be complemented by Andreas Demuth, Executive Director of the Centre Holdings.
Pavel Vopara<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> was appointed as the new joint director of the business, and Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erov<0xC3><0xA1>, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinated to him.
The new head of information technology was <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Burda.
The joint director of the editorial offices is Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pisk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team includes Jakub Unger, director for transformation.
Adéla Pitts was appointed Marketing Director.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotsk<0xC3><0xA1> now manages a separate corporate communications unit.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, the human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to enter the market with a joint offer of advertising products, to better link the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to further significantly streamline the business management of the company," added <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
The company Economia, owned by the financier Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, concluded an agreement on the acquisition of Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktualno.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail database under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or a portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
The company Economia is the publisher of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, news server IHNED.cz, weekly magazines Respect and Ekonom and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its major titles.
This June, the publishing house moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague’s Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
CME is targeting the TV business.
Almost a quarter of the people will be released.
The CME media group will be fired.
By the end of the year, he wants to lose a thousand people.
Osekat intends all the side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of approximately 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is the company CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and the Czech version of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV number one TV Nova, it is not yet clear.
“This is premature and we really can’t comment on it,” said Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, director of communication at Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
According to the MF DNES, significant redundancies to the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact should have on the personnel status of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
The two new heads of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who followed longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday about their desire to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the costs of producing its own programmes, filmmaking and production activities.
A cooling tower burned down at night in the industrial complex of the Czech Communist Party in Prague
A large-capacity storage tank was on fire in the industrial complex of the Czech Army in Prague, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters were already leaving for the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they were still putting out the fire," Prague firefighters spokeswoman Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air, according to measurements, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are still unknown.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the area in Kolbenova Street.
"This is a fire in a large-capacity storage tank, probably a cooling tower," Adamco said.
"There is no functioning hydrant network in the area, so we are extinguishing it by means of transport lines from tanks," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the extinguishing of a poorly functioning network of hydrants was complicated, so the firefighters had to transport the water from elsewhere.
The fire department has issued a second fire alarm.
There are four grades in total, in the most serious situations the fourth is announced.
The chemists also went to the site to check the level of dangerous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of pollutants in the air that exceeded hygiene standards," a firefighters spokesperson said.
British Police Receive Release Notice for Assange
British police have delivered a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he sought asylum.
Scotland Yard said he had delivered a 40-year-old Australian a “resignation notice” asking him to appear at the police station and that if he did not do so, he could face arrest.
Under British law, Assange ran out of options when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he sought asylum in the South American country.
“Scotland Yard has delivered an extradition notice to a 40-year-old man asking him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour assigned to him,” a spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail terms.
The Embassy refused to comment on the receipt of the release notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges because he posted 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on WikiLeaks.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester police court, Howie confessed to the charge of driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to reimburse the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100 for the accused.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the tax on the income of financial assets, but it is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as individuals.
The income from the transfer fee for housing in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of real estate to high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is undertaxed regardless of the effect of an outdated head tax system.”
He added that “this step may have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London, or the existing owners to be reluctant to sell.”
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt, which ranges from Fulham to Wimbledon, recorded a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year on year, but were overshadowed by a booming “home market” in which, according to a survey by Savills, real estate firms experienced southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) growth.
Scientists have shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog’s mood
Previous research has shown that joyful dogs spin their tails more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs wave their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: “It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain have different connections to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
We've been trying to observe the same thing in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to gain more information about how dogs respond to the uneven spinning of the tail of other dogs, researchers monitored animals that watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It will probably not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown dogs dog movies – either in a natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the tail movement and show it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise insignificant dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog spinning its tail), it remained absolutely calm.
But when she recorded the tail shot mostly to the left (again, from the dog's point of view, spinning the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals seemed uncertain.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs communicate consciously with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience which movements they must and do not need to pay attention to.
He said: “If you encounter dogs several times and the movement of their tail in one direction is repeatedly associated with more friendly behavior and the movement to the right gives rise to less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, a professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another treatise from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to get acquainted with a dog robot when it twisted its tail to the left than to the right, when it became rather uncertain – quite the opposite of the Italian study.”
The difference, he said, could be that the dogs in these different studies did not treat the animals in the movies or the dog robots completely like dogs.
He explained that it could help to study how dogs respond to real dogs.
“Although there is strong evidence for many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved the concert in Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the show.
The group’s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro Complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.”
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets for these performances remain valid.
We would like to apologise to everyone who bought tickets for the inconvenience that caused them.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals have the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successor.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, when the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 elective cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Pater Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the ceremonial promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals in the election is likely to drop by February.
He said the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of electors to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory will be significant next year because it will be the first one since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe in Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope is nominating cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who were tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope has decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said that popes traditionally promoted bishops from great places to the post of cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is appointing.”
GM recalls some new light trucks in the U.S. over seat backrest repairs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to repair a manual backrest tilting fault, according to a statement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority on Friday.
For some of these vehicles, the tilt mechanism of the front seats may be defective.
As a result, seat backrests do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if a car is hit from behind, the headrest may not protect passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury.”
Downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the vehicle in June and it is the most important vehicle launch for the leading American carmaker since its restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the van owner of the malfunction in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review notifications to owners due to a 16-day government malfunction that weakened car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were redesigned for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras from its deliveries.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Desperate Shout of Obama Voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope for a possible change.
He says Obama's sincere efforts have hampered the Republican Party's obstruction.
Obstructive politics cannot excuse the sorrows of Obama’s healthcare website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I am reading a sad book these days.
About this book, I thought that during the dark days of my second year at medical school, I would be encouraged and renewed in me a touch of hope.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win,” and it’s a reminiscence of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish my patient testimonials in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches have taken your breath away.
The election ended in overwhelming supremacy, and the television news forced us to think about the historical value of this moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents hid the newspapers they had found.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At the time of his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I rolled in my first ballot, there really was a change.
It was definitely nothing I had imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “no questions, no words” after the death of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstruction has reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, the ability of the public to choose health care, and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit when it comes to the explanations they can provide.
I was in a place of political hopelessness.
The Republican obstructions cannot explain the agreement to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
It cannot be explained by the fact that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, nor by the fact that it persecutes those who expose the wrong actions of the government.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without a fair trial or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can not even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if anything like this could have been expected.
Should I have known at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected office obviously has no predictable course, and our public conversations will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unfocused alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that Obama’s second term, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Yet a return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the many promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back on pace and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over parental leave program
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest over the parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million coal tax, made the claim while trying to clear the table of the question of whether he was in a conflict of interest.
Palmer’s United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be involved in conflicts of interest, adding that Abbott’s daughters were in a position where they could benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether or not she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the chair race for Fairfax County in the Sunshine Coast region with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results in order to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the polling stations?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, tap the details on your computer, vote immediately and have the results at half past seven in the evening?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is, the results can be rubberized if someone doesn't like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently published a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his policy agenda also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and would take his new job “very seriously”.
A public office is a public service.
"We seek no reward other than to serve society in this critical time," he said.
Do you wash your hands?
Scientists have figured out that washing your hands will change your mind and mind.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving the insoluble problem.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that had washed their hands after the failure was much more optimistic than the group that had not washed their hands.
Also, the group "washed hands" performed better in the next test than the second.
Still, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash them.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not record any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical purity removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, motivation decreases, the test subjects have to concentrate much more in subsequent tests.
If we passed the results of the research to the Czechs, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, only one percent of Czechs and Czechs do not wash their hands, but after traveling by public transport, it is already a fifth.
In general, hygiene is also used after work in the garden or in the workshop, when 85% of people wash their hands.
Pet grooming motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
A recent survey revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks wash their hands.
The survey showed that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be appropriate, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to do a little bit better," said skin doctor Claudia Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by supervisory authorities into suspected currency market machinations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities to investigate the world’s largest financial market, where they change owners of $5.3 trillion every day.
The two traders mentioned would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation that responds to the LIBOR (London Interbank Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event said that RBS had handed over to the British Financial Conduct Authority records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to accounts of a former trader.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to be relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European chairman of Citi’s cash trading, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any misdemeanour.
Mr. Usher's instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, the people inside the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it had investigated suspected foreign currency market machinations in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations that these bankers have teamed up to move the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched an internal investigation or had received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks scour through years of fast news and emails to find cases of misdemeanors.
Investigative reports have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest profit-making engines in investment bank closures in recent years, but which has been disrupted by the small volatility of currencies limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by arguing that it is basically impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but high-ranking traders say that this does not necessarily have to be true.
A high-profile trader said that despite the considerable volume of daily foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and banks, increasing the use of their own internal platforms, means that “you can start to influence the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired from its stock trading department this week a trader who caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately alerted the competent authorities and cooperates with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this merchant acted alone and that this problem has been solved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
Number of HIV-infected people in Prague exceeds 1,000
Doctors in Prague have already registered more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 until the end of the third quarter, tests confirmed the infection in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to statistics from the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, there have been 2,063 infections in the Czech Republic so far.
In 396, the disease had already broken down.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year over the past decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were identified, and in 2010, 180.
The number fell to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who has led the Prague Light House for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the infection in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, doctors registered 21 new patients and three new patients.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
Anyone who wants to get to know a city should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the crammed center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than the bedekr would reveal.
Many people “read from the graves.”
They slowly wander the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what beliefs, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what taste they have.
And from the state of the graves, they will also find out how the survivors take care of their dead.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the Constitution, a landslide victory for the Obama administration.
In a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 or risk paying a fine – does not contravene the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also upheld the remaining parts of the 2700-page law and further ruled that the legal requirement for health care, which orders states to extend the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatens to lose all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contrary to the Constitution.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed lawsuits to block the law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law strongly rejected every major Republican candidate, including the supposed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
'Mugabe is a limp donkey' is no longer in jail, court overturns law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to the public talk of the ninety-eight-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s and then led it since the end of 1987.
Under section 33 of the Penal Code, a fine of $100 to one year's imprisonment was imposed for contempt of office.
“Representatives of the state should not fervently accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,” the Constitutional Court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
A number of Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a police officer, were vocally against the law.
In May, an opposition activist honoring Mugabe in public ended up in jail with the vilification of a "limping donkey".
In August, the prosecutor accused the 26-year-old man of his intention to use a poster with the face of Robert Mugabe as toilet paper.
The court also ruled that the law restricting media freedom was unconstitutional.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be false," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law allowing to criminalize someone for making a false statement has a chilling effect on the right to freely express oneself,” Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with wider civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
A small step away from the dictatorship of one man came in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition brought Morgan Tsvangirai to the prime minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe is only paid in currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is on the verge of Mugabe's reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
However, most of them had no experience with running farms.
Central banks will keep swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks to access global currencies whenever they need them.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
“It’s a very sensible step,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at London’s Barclays Bank.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is not a surprise to me," adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are reinforcing the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first collapsed.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes as the US Fed prepares to end its program of supporting the US economy, which could drive the price of money in the global market even higher.
A swap contract is typically used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while simultaneously overflowing the liquidity of another currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a borrowing of another currency.
The ECB is launching its third attempt to restore confidence in European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, with the ECB overseeing 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) erases personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish it because someone was just sitting at the branch who could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I did not want to go to another branch, the registration expired, then I moved and as a result my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it is not possible because I have a different OP number, address and that it is simply not possible to complete it and that I have to request the deletion of the data and make a new registration.
So I did and on October 24, 2013 I wrote to technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database in accordance with the applicable data protection law.
For this rainy day I wrote to the technical support that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
Thus began the marathon of emails to technical support, where they finally wrote after the 4th Urgant 25.10. that they had deleted personal data at my request.
So one would think that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they also deleted this).
So I used a different username and it popped up on me that my personal data is already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have something that claims to have been deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I was asked how it was possible, they wrote me that they actually deleted the personal data on 25.10. and sent me an e-mail with that error.
I did this (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and they wrote me off today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that this is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I have been contacting the technical support team for a week now and it is not possible to do so.
And what if it were true what it claims (which it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way, at 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fictional e-mail and phone number and the world was surprised, a page appeared to me that they sent me an e-mail link to complete the registration.
But how is this possible when you can’t register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport tied the registration to an email and phone number and data simply did not discard as they claim.
So I told the tech support again that they are just lying (either intentionally or they don’t know what they’re writing), because what they’re writing is not true.
I have proved several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration does not affect this.
To this, Tipsport wrote me a stern sentence - I'm sorry, but since you're already registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And he shut down the communication.
It repeats the same sentence over and over again that the registration is tied to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not actually take place.
To sum up, Tipsport has not only failed to erase the data as it claims, but is still lying when it claims otherwise.
What’s worse is that it’s easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this matter on my personal blog, things got a bit moving and an e-mail came from the Technical Support that the matter was being referred for review and I will be informed (after a week of urgent and debating and notifying you of the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the bridge
Prague Transport Company (DPP) has launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek presented his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne City Hall not only his brand new double CD Czech Calendar, but especially in the show Between Us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondra Rumla accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Benko.
After the introductory intro and the acting etude about the late musician, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how they last played in Cologne and in the theater, and electric current fell out throughout the city.
"Otherwise, two types of cards were produced in Cologne, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
He also spoke to President Zeman.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of Z<0xC3><0xA1>kolane or D<0xC3><0xBA>bravka near Bratislava," he joked about the families of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who had not left the stage and had not spoken, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef M<0xC3><0xA1>nes, who put it on the eagle, but at that time he had no idea how we meet on those squares and chanting, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won’t play here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, said that he sang a very suitable song for him to sleep during the day, sing at night, and accompanied her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, played percussion, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three singers sang together a little bit of rap to the side of the heart, which immediately stirred the auditorium.
"I'm glad you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in Kmoch's town," Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
After the memory of Peter Hapka, I recognize in the performance of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller, rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Hegerov<0xC3><0xA1> was reminded of the song "Dad liked L<0xC3><0xAD>da Baarov<0xC3><0xA1>" with Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek's explanation of the communist ban and the replacement of Baarov<0xC3><0xA1> by an American actress.
The composer Michael Koc<0xC3><0xA1>b was reminded of the composition Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n, Segrado then sang a wonderful composition Prague performed by Jarda Svoboda, a native of Zasmuck and former Kol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xA1>k.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in the standing and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We are living in a wonderful time.
There was another addition to the playlist, but the fans did not applaud it anymore.
Almost immediately after the concert, the four of them sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech Calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s books and even the cover of the legendary LP and took a photo with any interested parties.
Berdych and <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek will be complemented by Rosol and H<0xC3><0xA1>jek
At the Davis Cup final against Serbia, the non-playing Czech tennis captain Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til nominated four Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan H<0xC3><0xA1>jek.
The Czech team defends the trophy, but they are going to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going to the hot ground, it's going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always."
"We will go there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the scorer of last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis showed exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary hype, threats and millions of statements, the planes were sent, hitting the target and returning.
Without being lulled by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of the confused and grandiose, unsupported actions of Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis were bombing.
Don’t be fooled by the media’s claims that a “Syrian base” or “delivery to Hezbollah” was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while U.S. aid to the country’s secular rebels remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia is cheerfully continuing to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of an Israeli airstrike.
A clear message.
And notice, Israel has again bombed the Assad regime, not the rebels, although according to popular internet theories, it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government honored two members of the space force, presumably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they had distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
The heroic deaths of two former SEALs defending the CIA compound in the city are known to me as members of a secret CIA command made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at the CIA residence elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one of which both members of the SEALs died after hitting a mortar) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about these two hitherto unknown heroes.
They were part of the American command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the news of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is embarrassed by the fact that during that attack that command was not deployed officially and whole, and that it was simply hesitant what to do.
The commander of the command, so without orders, seems likely to release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently American commandos, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And this is because until recently, such a thing was not officially recognized, and even now we are only talking about some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
It is good, however, that the United States is trying halfway to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although to solve the national situation, it would require much more help.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
Not so long ago, the media almost chanted the Iranian air force for prosecuting American drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the airspace, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if the Iranians are discovered drones in the international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in the international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history occurred.
He flew the Phantom to visually verify his armament, without the Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared at his side and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, the Phantom listened without grumbling.
No wonder the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't be compared to a Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen still knows how to win, Rajtoral promises
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has been mostly unsuccessful recently, defender or midfielder Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, he is full of activity, after the intervention on him, a fine kick was ordered in the match in Teplice.
Victoria reached for victory in the last two rounds against Slavia and Teplice, but in the end she took only one point out of these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the game against Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a difficult match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is aimed at the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as always we draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent's game.
"I believe it will be an excellent match on Friday evening," the Czech representative of the fans at the Doosan Arena draws.
The Pilsners' last games didn't turn out as they wished, but the word of the crisis was rejected by Victoria's defender.
That’s how it goes in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes you’re in worse shape.
But I wouldn’t talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe that we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the defenders of the West Bohemians said.
The Victoria team will once again rely on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night and I want to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," Rajtoral adds.
Jana Pet<0xC5><0xA5>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap a few years back, into my memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, luxuriate and do your homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, to throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with other kids, jump a drink.
Then during the series Helena and her boys embroidered with a chain stitch a festive tablecloth for Grandma's birthday.
And then after several warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, in the winter to put wood in the tile stove and do tasks until dark under the lamp (or rely on a classmate and instead of tasks to write in love verses addressed to school love).
In the morning, breakfast homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the contents of which were not even lying next to strawberries) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which Mom and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that were loudly filmed in an old tape recorder for my mother.
And then we rewinded the cassettes on the pencil and played the same song over and over again, our favorite, and toasted it with a siphon.
Or we telephoned through the table with the help of cans that were tied to each other by a rope - and while we were talking about the telephone to make ourselves better heard, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the then-hotshot was sirka + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it in such a way that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need any iPhones, iPads, or even mobile phones or laptops or branded clothing.
Clothing was inherited from generation to generation, and the best "surprise" in the wardrobe was a baticed T-shirt made by SAVA.
From electronics, we were satisfied with the aforementioned mother's tape recorder and, most of all, the Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, don't be angry, or as I said, go "only" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, I'm sure his parents were saving for him for a long time, but unfortunately he didn't warm up for a long time.
My younger sister tossed a strudel into him, said he was so beautifully taping the tapes, so she tried to see if he could get the strudel.
Unfortunately, he did, but it was his last bite.
Well, that's what happened to him today, poor man, on my dad's plate all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she tossed the strudel into the video and thought she would play the recipe and not play it, which is why she still can't bake it.
I remember how we were all able to communicate with each other, talk without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I made an appointment with my grandmother's granddaughter on vacation, when we will meet again next summer at my grandmother's house - and so it was, so it was.
We've met.
Can you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I were running outside, building snowmen, riding on snowy hills near the church on sacks stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard before each dinner the famous phrase: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, that's true today, but you certainly don't have any soap tied to the faucet in the lemon mesh in your bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad in the garage “worked” beer with Jarda from the village, my mom and I lay down on the floor, leaned our feet against the tile stove, opened the door and looked at the flame and listened to the crackling of the wood that was lining from the stove.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we did not write messages daily through various chats, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew a lot more about each other.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I supplement these memories by looking at albums, where black and white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And in case I didn’t know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written the year of taking the photo.
I see that even though we didn’t like the cuts according to the pot and we also had a pair of pants bigger than our cousin, no one had ever laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
I’d like to take that step back – back to reality.
Until 2013 and I will be waiting for what the modern era will come up with for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are now for the young teenage generation so at least somewhere "a hundred years after the monkeys" and I think they lose a lot that they will not experience this "premature" time either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for Nortel, filed a lawsuit Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone makers, including Google, a company it re-listed in a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in a U.S. District Court in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps link search terms to relevant ads, according to the lawsuit, which is the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes heavily with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for Nortel’s patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a trade driven in part by Motorola’s patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain the patents at auction, Google has violated the patents and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit states.
Rockstar seeks increased damages from Google because it claims that Google intentionally infringes the patent, as the lawsuit alleges.
Miloslava Cejpkov<0xC3><0xA1>: The November Smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we are not yet used to.
At first, she put off her smile, the one she kept on display as a defense against her willingly friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she chose not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>ka around her.
And, of course, when her sons called.
She remembered very well the lessons of the endless courses of business skills.
They were really useful now.
Not to grieve her loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
It's like dressing up in a costume.
November, or any other month, can't do that miracle to make her really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn't been here for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president
Morsi has taken the inaugural oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old US engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception as an illegal organization.
When Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small column of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police officers were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike Mubarak's presidency, the traffic was only briefly halted so that the column could drive through the usually busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Morsi’s personal prestige, ridiculed as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and Friday’s speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also all those who want to bring an end to the revolt against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi said, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie to judges in a wooden chamber where he was sworn in.
Morsi later traveled to Cairo University to give an inaugural speech.
While he was on guard, he received an official welcome from the military band that played the national anthem.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantavi, was present.
His arrival was accompanied by the chanting "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly vowed to seize again the presidential powers taken from his office by a military council that took them from the exiled leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in court, rather than in front of parliament, as is customary, he yielded to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi’s speech at Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
The ghettos are likely to have police specialists to ease tensions.
In ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future should be working police specialists.
They'd spend up to half their walks here.
They would look after order and solve problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and residents from the surrounding areas.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior expects this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would be mainly helped by "accelerated provision of social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living there, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were unemployed, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
Bully interest.
According to experts, in the meantime, the number of problem sites has increased by one hundred.
Relations between their residents and others are escalating.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
There were also people from the area who joined the extremists.
According to the Interior Ministry, it is difficult for the police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
A key condition is "consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
But this is impossible without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go on errands in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd oversee order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better solve problems or misdemeanors.
“Thanks to the trust established, specialists will be able to more easily prevent a number of violations,” the interior ministry said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive surcharges of 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers in problem areas is to be reimbursed from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by the neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Romani settlements here," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that will determine the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the end of the project.
According to the project proposal, first selected police officers will undergo an internship in Slovakia.
Fifty people per year are expected to attend this training.
They will be the most suitable candidates.
There should also be special training for police officers who will be active in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the ideas of the interior, there would be three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with well-defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social apartments, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan that would be drawn up with them by social workers.
They would have to comply with the housing rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
The system of permeable housing should operate for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows up "in an inclusively motivated environment".
The social housing model is prepared by the ministries for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Dr<0xC3><0xA1>bek: Coal Mountain - one of our youngest volcanoes.
The Coal Hill is a notable hill 3 km southeast of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Together with several others, it is evidence of volcanic activity in Low Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k at the time (from a geological point of view) of recent times.
The last eruptions were here at the beginning of the Quaternary.
Looking from a greater distance, the white-painted Baroque pilgrimage church of Our Lady of Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765, is noticeable at the top of the Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> Hill.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church did not survive.
Shortly after the completion of the church was planted an alley of four rows of linden, about 1 km long.
The crossroads at Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001 it lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by local art carver Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used various types of wood from the area of Low Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
Similarly, the pedestals from the rocks from the local area form an interesting geological exposition.
At each stop, the name of the sponsor is indicated.
The Coal Mountain is the remnant of a young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric measurements of the age varies slightly, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudny (3.3 million years old) and older than the volcano Venus (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born by an explosion.
It ejected a considerable amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the ground, which, when burned, became reddish-brown.
At the end of this phase, lava has come to the surface - today it is a layer of porous basalt up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brown-red, and sometimes black tufas.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
Volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size are noticeable in tufas. The second eruption was also completed with a spout of lava.
At the end of the activity, lava flowed out of the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m thick layer of basalt.
Volcanoes that alternate volcanic ash ejection with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was threatened by the mining of rocks in a quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here in the years 1953 - 1962.
Tufts were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under the pressure of experts and the public, mining was stopped and thus this unique place was preserved.
However, the problem lies in the porosity and small coherence of the rocks, which quickly weather, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
Lom disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is ideal for some rare species of plants and animals.
The correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained on a number of important sites.
You can reach Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch by a green tourist sign from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l, or from Slezsk<0xC3><0xBD> Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the linden alley, where the short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to a panel house.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in an apartment villa with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on Orechovec.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move out with a small severance.
Ivana was therefore quickly looking for a place to live for herself and her then-older mother.
From friends she got a tip on apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the vast forest park and dam on the other side impressed me," recalls Ivana at first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year proviso.
"Today we have been living here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from the one-hundred-and-twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary modifications had to be made, for example, lacquering the doors or replacing the windows.
The previous owner demolished the core, but the owner was most disturbed by the impractical solution and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
The combination of the two rooms created a multifunctional living space.
The architects used plasterboard to delineate the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed a new location of the lights.
The first step she took after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step to partially improve the standard was to replace the PVC floor with laminate flooring.
Ivana didn't know how to use the bathroom.
For years I have been collecting magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
On the recommendation, I contacted the young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the available hallway.
The architect connected the toilet and bathroom space and replaced two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rova continued.
As part of the program How to Build a Dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
We had to get three functions, dining, living and sleeping, into the space, which was created by combining two smaller rooms, without using the classical principles of optical division, such as semi-transverses or Japanese walls.
"This would ultimately violate the openness and unity of the space," the architect explains.
It was possible to separate the living and sleeping area.
All you had to do was turn your back on the two sofas and build a custom-made bedspread cabinet between them.
The dining area is defined by the shades of the floor and painting.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high-quality marmoleum, the sliding doors revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marmole floor has a number of advantages over the previous laminate floor: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted in color is an example of how to work with space in the panel house.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphic glass cladding with the motif of blooming magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underscored the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the older one works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal chandelier and with high-quality art objects that Ivana has been collecting all her life.
The kitchen was the last one.
The lockers had previously been spread on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect reduced their number and relocated.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens the slightly pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to an ingenious solution washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the whole glass wall cladding above the worktop.
Unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is well maintained.
Ivana chose magnolia flowers, which remind her of her favorite neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems to be happy here too.
In the original bathroom there was a small bath and sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of the tile.
The large shower has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create a bright, simple space from the given environment, in which the functions and devices will be in harmony.
We united the interior materially and in color and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
“Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of everyday items,” adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Supreme Court has ruled that bad weather can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court has ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as can also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the Chamber.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksy, Marko <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e, on the other hand, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they surrendered their parliamentary mandate last November, said Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig.
By this decision, the court rejected the application of Prosecutor Ivo Istvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and not making it difficult to pass laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister, who offered them these posts.
An anti-corruption police officer was also detained with V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Chudoba, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of MPs of the VV, also did not want to express himself too much about the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client also in this case, but due to the protection of classified facts, I can no longer comment on it."
According to the law, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The news server tn.cz said that Barta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to the news server prvnizprazy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment to the post of B<0xC3><0xA1>rt was allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta has nothing to do with Peter Lessy.
The spokesperson of the Police Presidium, Eva Kropo<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, refused to comment on the case, saying that the case was being handled by the Prague City Council.
"We will not comment on this question in any way with regard to the protection of classified facts," said on Friday Pravo spokesman of the Municipal State Prosecutor's Office in Prague <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It is the local prosecutor who is supervising Bart’s case and, therefore, it is implicit in her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted under secrecy.
Reporter Novinek managed to reach the wife of V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnova, in the morning before their residence in Prague’s Kl<0xC3><0xA1>rov.
She was just loading her suitcases in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, spoke about Bart's detention.
According to his words, he has no idea what the case is about.
“Vit Barta was one of many candidates on our list, and as I said before the election, he was not, and is not, a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura,” he said.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, who in the past early elections to the Plze<0xC5><0x88>sk<0xC3><0xBD> kraj Chamber of Deputies unsuccessfully ran for the movement Dawn of Direct Democracy by Tomio Okamura, is known for his corruption case of bribing MPs from Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The sentence was later changed and Barta was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
Juice, lust and enthusiasm I still have
The family has always been in the first place for Prospil, which is why he wants to fully submit to it at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he's definitely done with hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for the offer.
Despite the fact that he is an eminent worker who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and can tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was the most productive player in Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone is still in me," he says resolutely.
He may be in charge of the New York Rangers, who have failed to enter the season and are injured by two strikers - Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like when you come to the Rangers?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that says they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been said that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but it just isn't.
Have you heard from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place every day.
The point is to get into a situation where the contract really comes.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone is not able to do it and the manchaft does not tread.
There are a lot of different factors that need to come together to get this contract.
But there are similar circumstances in New York, don't you think?
Rick Nash is hurt with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't get into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to do it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't got any yet.
That is the reality that I have to live in.
You're leaving for America on Friday, and you're expecting something to work out?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5th, when the NHL opened the free-player market, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
Certainly not, I'm going to Tampa for my kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and see you again.
Do you have your program planned?
This is because I am a father and a husband, and everything depends on it.
I'm not a hockey player right now - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
Already on Sunday, Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k has two hockey matches, which is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking about doing this in full-time quotation marks?
Sure, you can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
One day it will get to a stage where all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
You can have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of your family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to family - is also sporting success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And that is where family life comes from.
My kids, sorry, our kids -- my wife and I -- grew up in the States, started going to school, and so on.
We would love to see them continue this trend.
Because what we're going to say is, in America, the possibilities are somewhere else.
We should give them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in America permanently?
We'll practice it like we've done before.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on Hlubok<0xC3><0xA1> and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It's perfect to be warm all the time.
I've had a lot of luck in my life.
You can say that I went to meet him, it cost a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options, and this is one of them.
My wife and I can choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who want this so that they can choose what they will do and how they will live.
How long will you have the will to work hard at your age, train hard and wait for an offer?
Yeah, well, that's a question I can't answer.
Today I still have it in me, the juice, the lust, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I am still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it's gonna be there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you will wait for it to erupt and then decide what to do next?
I'm at a stage where I go day by day.
Recently, the CEO of CEZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th blocks of the Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant has been postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for a new State Energy Concept and approving Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current management of CEZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, to the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should make recommendations to shareholders, not hide behind them.
The government is only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is starting to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn political craftsmanship in the opposition and that it will have to go directly to the government in order for any one to arise.
The President YES admitted this in an interview for Law, which will be published tomorrow.

Police evacuate part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
There was a shooting at Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
The police evacuated part of the airport as a result of this, allegedly it was Terminal 3.
Reuters, citing California media, said the lawmen shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there had been a shootout that injured two to three members of the Transportation Security Administration.
How many people were injured and whether there were any victims is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about the incident with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed U.S. government official, this was announced by CNN.
The Israeli press reported extensively about the explosion in the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
An Israeli military spokesman, when asked by CNN, declined to comment on the airstrike.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The Israeli airstrike was targeted by missiles and related equipment, according to a U.S. government source, which the Israelis believe could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli strike on the target on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
A second Israeli television channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the area of the attack, however, according to the DPA, showed the battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to track missiles and their targets.
According to a report by Israeli television, the missiles have a range of 35 kilometers and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has already bombed missile shipments inside Syria at least twice this year, according to CNN and the AP.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will intervene in any arms shipments to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist groups.
Does the Internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to range between $325 million and $340 million, up from $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said that Flight Centre generated 8% profit in the first half of the year and the second half began with strong growth mainly in Australian and British off-the-job travel.
“As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and a few are heading towards record annual earnings before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are traditionally our biggest profit makers.
Recreation business boomed in Australia during the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreation area, while business clients spent less.
U.S. trade has recovered from a loss during the seasonally weaker half of the year and is expected to generate year-round profits for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares were 3 cents higher at $38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting against planned oil production in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by the AFP news agency, citing the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
She also claims that the initial allegations of piracy by her activists have not yet been dropped.
“Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil platform in the Arctic have been transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Ecologists were first charged with piracy, for which they could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charge with milder riots, for which there is a lower penalty with a maximum of seven years in prison.
In a statement, Greenpeace said the authorities had not withdrawn the piracy charges as promised.
That means the detainees are now being charged with two crimes.
The powerful Committee of Inquiry announced last week that it would replace the piracy charges with riot charges.
But when 30 prisoners were brought before the committee this week, the charges of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, a new charge was brought against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen Greenpeace members from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were aboard the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they appealed, but the court rejected them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the conditions of detention.
Greenpeace chief executive Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet with their families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they could be worse," he said.
Willem-Alexander, one of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, she invited the monarch to speak about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Maliki is said to have played a large part in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is partly part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on math, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards will have to be studied in English literature classes.
The test will also include ‘hidden text’ to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English Literature and Language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to have a language exam, and will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish a new curriculum for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical change.
Other major changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new grading system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In his speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus on whether we need to reform our exam system to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation exam be “more demanding, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on mathematics, and in Singapore, about 138 hours a year.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive math graduation exam – along with more emphasis on the subject in the scoreboards – is likely to encourage schools to provide extra tuition.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems”, including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not the cancer in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Before the elections, a long-smoked dispute broke out between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, appealed to the court for undemocratic drafting of candidates.
Nevertheless, the actors of the case did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to harm the party even more before the elections.
Now the votes of the voters have been counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step out of the party on Monday evening, and will probably push him to lose his post.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is involved in the dispute and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Diary.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
The Fed certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt in our country that before the elections, disputes within the party were resolved in the media?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, this corresponds to the state in which the CSSD is now.
It is a party that has its own internal problems, is internally ill, and people perceive that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
In my opinion, the ODS has been going through a decline for some time now, and unfortunately, such things are now happening in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their prebends at the ODS, moved to the people in the CSSD and influence them.
This has to do with the fact that the police go around the offices of the Ostrava City Hall and collect computers.
It shows that the CSSD is not composed only of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily about their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
But it has also been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foretaste of what is happening now in Prague.
The Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek wing gradually occupied positions, so that after the elections it could provoke a situation that would weaken the Sobotka wing.
You are in a situation where you have to make compromises from time to time.
But everyone has an internal boundary where compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case too.
Originally I did not want to run for the House, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lk that I would try to get on the regional candidate to strengthen the Sobotka wing as the mayor of Ostrava.
But Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's wing put a stop to it.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek?
Slavek Sobotka, in my opinion, is a person who always talks primarily about the CSSD program and, to a certain extent, about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I haven't heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Bureau, which is a lower body than the central executive committee, can begin to dismiss the party president.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party's statutes.
In my opinion, with what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you perceive that the Ostrava leadership of the CSSD did not approve you for the candidate?
Political parties are based on the competition of which of their members is placed.
This competition should be largely based on programme visions and on the ability of those people to fulfil those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not have received elsewhere.
The problem is when these people start to get to the foreground due to the fact that they break the rules without scruples, violate the party's statutes.
With their practices, they make the political parties of the mafia and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To draw attention to this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you submit a motion to the court for interim measures against the form of the candidate of the CSSD in the Moravian-Silesian Region?
The current District Executive Committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by abolishing organizations that do not suit it, setting up new organizations on purpose, and gradually expelling inconvenient party members.
An example is the fact that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the club of deputies, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they then canceled the resolution on his expulsion.
This shows that while demanding compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, at the moment when the other methods and control bodies within the CSSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The attempt of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD leadership, led by Adam Rykala, is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that Mayor Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza of Poruba is in charge of this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything so that they can call me off.
They promise people positions, get votes, and then consolidate their power in the party for those votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Basel stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me a man who puts money where it doesn't belong.
In doing so, the city bought property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see this going on with your tenure as mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the CSSD.
But I think it's like a thief shouting, "Catch the thief!"
Looking at the results of my work over the past eleven years, I see no one in Ostrava’s social democracy who initiates and promotes, sometimes against party members, the emergence of so many developmental things, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, I'm getting uncomfortable.
I do not read it except to prevent others from reaching the places they desire.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, then political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to govern the state effectively if it cannot even govern itself.
So I don’t think I’m leaving the CSSD now, because I think that the one who causes this party’s cancer is not me, but these people who are trying to excite me.
Olomouc will open a public ice rink in the historic centre
Organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spalén<0xC3><0xBD> said that the preparatory work on the skating rink was started on October 26 and the ice production unit has been in operation since Wednesday.
The ice layer is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The rink has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took up 358 square meters.
Skater and passers-by will also have two stalls with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably rewind," he described.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the ice rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of Doln<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice sheet could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the ice rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice area then became an integral part of the Christmas markets in the city.
The Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural programme, will start on Horn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> one month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>nsko will be solved again by the regional court
The Regional Court acquitted the 25-year-old Slovak and the 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men denied the guilt.
They could face 15 to 20 years in prison or even exceptional sentences.
Spokesman Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court overturned the district court’s decision and returned the case to him again for consideration.
The judge refused to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
The senior died a grievous death.
According to the indictment, he was strangled, beaten and kicked all over his body, and was also struck with a metal object, apparently a gas gun, about three dozen times in the head.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull, swelling of the brain or bleeding in the brain, to which he succumbed on the spot.
The young men allegedly took about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the Regional Court, the only, moreover, only indirect evidence against the defendants was odour traces, which the expert assessed as not fully established in the sense of the legal guidelines.
Smell marks from the scene of the crime and on other cases coincided with the defendants in more than a dozen cases, but the police initially treated them as factual and not odour marks.
In addition, some mistakes were found in dealing with them.
According to the Senate, the defendants' guilt has not been proven without a doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
Not even a call-up ambulance doctor was aware of the violent death.
After a few days, the criminals were contacted by Olomouc doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all the traces from the crime scene that the relatives had cleaned up.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, upheld last year by the Olomouc Supreme Court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who are responsible for robbery of goldsmiths.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior man in Slopn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The youngest of those accused of murdering a senior lives in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from prison in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins with the reconstruction of the stadium
In early November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living legend Wayne Shorter closes next week Strings of Autumn
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make next Wednesday’s dot at the 18th annual Strings of Autumn festival.
Shorter will perform at the Lucerne Grand Hall on November 6 with his quartet consisting of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation of the PKF - Prague Philharmonic under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>k.
Shorter's adaptations for the symphony orchestra include the song Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older songs Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which proves that the Prague concert on Strings of Autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than 60 years ago.
The list of artists he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitou<0xC5><0xA1> and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom in the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade they set the direction of a new fusion style.
He has been performing with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the past 13 years.
Some kind of afterparty after the festival will be the Spotlight club night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD club.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrea Triana, the local audience will be introduced to the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring an electro-jazz formation Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> says UEFA has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>, chairwoman of the Arbitration Commission of the Czech Football Association, stopped publishing the sentences for judges.
It is forbidden by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Pravo.
Otherwise, he would be threatened with punishment.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> also refused to side with the Pilsen footballers, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the Commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of a vote I can lose 1:6," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said in response to the criticism, which was incensed after Pilsen recently played twice as much penalty as other league teams.
Thus, although in recent months FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing punishments for referees, Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> assures that the judges are punished for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict his delegation, whatever the match," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to Damka, the reason why the penalties are not published is a ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits and punishes the disclosure of such information."
"We're very suspicious here, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop, there will be tough sanctions," Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
“We were the exception,” she added.
If the publication of the information continues, the Commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And they're very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the training of judges," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
Barta's arrest has to do with Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém: Is there a wiretapping leak?
Public Affairs President V<0xC3><0xAD>ta Barta was arrested by police on Thursday.
Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of the anti-corruption police’s department of analytics and informatics, was arrested along with him.
The arrests are related to the wiretapping of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the wiretapping was confirmed by a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
The wiretapped phone calls between Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém, published last March by the newspaper Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Dnes, in which the two men call each other "Maz<0xC3><0xA1>nek" and "Kolib<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's influence on the steps of the city under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper said that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the security agency ABL.
He owned Bart at the time.
The news server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminal Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ilek had worked for the BIS just before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ilek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which subsequently dealt with the wiretapping, at the same time as they were published.
"Given the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
He refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the upcoming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act as of January 1, 2014.
Only 8% of companies surveyed said they had not addressed issues related to the two key codes in their company.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the approaching effective date of both key codes, it is only now at the last minute that a number of managers begin to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavishness of politicians, the business sector has long been uncertain whether or not revolutionary changes will come to fruition.
"But now they only have a few weeks to make the transition to the new law without complications for their companies," commented Jan Sp<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>il, partner at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in the new code, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all the necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of companies out of this number are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
One in five companies has not yet dealt with recodifications, but they have a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent do not have an opinion and cannot assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet addressed issues related to recodification.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is the conclusion of new contracts for the largest number of companies surveyed (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent), as well as changes in the real estate cadastre and liability for damages (after ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the whole recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new regulation will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of organization of relations," said Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>, lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In connection with the Law on Business Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies as the most important topic.
The following are topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible consequences for statutory bodies, especially in situations where companies are at risk of bankruptcy or enter into bankruptcy.
“In practice, this means that if the members of the boards of directors and managers of companies do not act with the care of a proper manager and do not reverse the impending bankruptcy of the company, they can lose the benefit gained for the performance of the office only in the last two years,” he added.
Pierre Rainero: I'm trying to make Cartier's style evolve like a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains Pierre Rainero, director of style at Cartier, in an interview for HN.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
It travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in the villages of Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year Award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
In 1981, Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near the Cameroonian capital Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received such treatment as was simply available.
"It's not easy," Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the doctors of Cameroon could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle says.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, nearly 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people stuff themselves into vans, attach medical supplies to rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
More than once, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get welcomed as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to get involved in the local fun.
The next day, the team began treating hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each expedition,” Bwelle says.
They come to the village from a radius of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of health care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get crutches or donated glasses or a birth certificate for free – a document that the school requires, but that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall, or at home; after surgery, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to make room for the next patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of the morning.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and keep working, they’re playing drums all night,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the locals.
One man said that after hernia surgery, he would be able to work again.
"It will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organising these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that it is this second work that finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and works as a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He’s always in the hospital, or he’s trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We washed Dr. Bwell’s hands thoroughly and removed blood stains or held his instruments,” O’Malley said.
You'll never experience that as a second-year medical student in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation, and study.
"He's definitely a hero," O'Malley says.
He gives his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, constant strife is not a burden.
To help others live a happier life, to fulfill the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to be doing this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to ease their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t renews the position of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100 thousand.
“I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office – a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary,” said Martin Holc<0xC3><0xA1>t, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the field of nursing deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
In the exercise of this profession, it is necessary not only to have a high professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
“I will gladly and responsibly try to push for those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us with their approach to patients, so that they do their calling with all empathy and help us improve the image of the nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>, on the occasion of her inauguration, also stated that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse’s position and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical professions and doctors.
“I don’t really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, with everyone having their own competencies and together with other healthcare professionals forming a coherent working team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself face a number of problems that occur in the exercise of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in solving them."
These include, for example, ensuring simplification of nursing and health records.
“I know from my own experience that some of the nurse’s administrative tasks unnecessarily burden them and deprive them of the time they could and should spend on patients,” says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Other areas she intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate in a team and with health care providers’ management, adjusting competences, as well as labour law issues such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overloading nurses with their insufficient number at a given time and place.
We often hear anonymous grievances, but they are not documented on a specific case where violations of the rules could occur due to fear of possible punishment.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Chief Nurse of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and allow the competent authorities to examine the specific case," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC3><0xAD>dov<0xC3><0xA1> graduated from the Secondary School of Medicine in the field of Nurse (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been working as head of the Department of Nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career, she worked as a bed nurse in the internal department, and she also worked as a teacher at the Secondary Medical School, where she was also a statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the chief nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional textbooks of nursing and articles in professional journals, she has devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
She is not a member of any political party.
Not to be swallowed by hate
Writer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Kahuda returned to writing after 12 years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a slender volume, suggests a number of pages comparable to his most famous work Hou<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ina (Petrov, 2001).
Emil Hakl, another prominent Czech writer of the present day, testified to Salon Kahuda.
What moved you to write a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't be swallowed by hate.
To see around us constantly new clones of human folly, young organisms affected by blind selfish striving.
I’m not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by helpless greed, vesklasky souls and opposite half-way ideologues who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a little selling slut.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, weirdos and hidden entities.
I'm over it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burn from life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then read books at the lighthouse in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of frustration, of hate.
Was there a turning point in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The break came a long time ago, at about the age of ten.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, that's what I lived for.
But there's still a quiet boy out there.
I see other lone practitioners, each in his tornado of anxiety.
It saved me from writing books.
I take part in this huge, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet - the birth of an elusive future.
The immense, breathtaking complexities of life, where every stone is the direct heir of our presence.
We are players of a sad and beautiful game, where by trial and error another generation of beings is created, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or have you started completely from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather the dialogue that leads to the right and left halves of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms into a book.
Just as periods of peace are interspersed with silent metastases of wars that may one day wake up, so my book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I didn't do anything, I'd be silent one day.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and placed in layers that are stored in the darkness "under the level of consciousness".
Neocortex, the grey cerebral cortex, asks the older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient rings of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, asks the serpents, seeks the answer in the flight of the birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry heavens above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain retains in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, being exposed to an ever-changing presence, in a constant effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important messages.
Sometimes there are problems with overload.
Similarly - as if you "falled" from a PC, from a speech emulator program and a translator from foreign languages you would get tangled up first in an operating environment, for example Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended up with a dark green-blinking Bios screen, in a basic system that controls the functions and cooperation on the motherboard, between the processor and the operating memory, etc.
For someone who has not yet understood what is being said, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why are you always interested in this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the previously functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - there will be a breakthrough.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "So long he looked into the abyss, that the abyss looked into him."
A pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "dies" and a new quality begins.
Why do I care about it personally?
I will answer with a parable.
Once upon a time, one fell into a pool and was drowning, days, months and years passed by, he was still drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a “diver.”
Perhaps someone will be helped by a sentence I wrote, as Hrabal's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super-ego, but I think Arthur Rimbaud best characterized it in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age, he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nemo, ran through the Shadows in dark alleys.
After all, behind all this branching of authors and their message is: "The sun is bright of other worlds of Karel Hynek M<0xC3><0xA1>cha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the reflection that comes back to you through the people who read the book, will they?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, maybe years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their hard life decision with my book.
Books are actually "lifes" or rather "worlds."
They are encoded in characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
We can wake them up to life at any time if we let their sentences flow to the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in lines - according to the old demonological books, we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, as usual, a chain of authorial readings awaits you.
I remember you used to like to read.
Are you going to jump into it again with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
Today, I prefer to just talk.
And what did I find out?
There are good smart people everywhere.
Their basic feature - they are inconspicuous, do not pay much attention to themselves, have friendly radiance, do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec there lived (and I hope he still lives) a curly bookstore (called <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful friend and a good girl's bull.
During one drink, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ina.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a shattered, read-out copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put down my just-counted morning, and wept briefly with a manly cry.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and weeping drunkenly with emotion.
Then the young, blonde, mixed man couldn't stand it, and he jumped his head out of the window into the snow.
It was downstairs.
We ran out into the night landscape and were beaten with the happy rabies of the sensitive, the sick soul of the countrymen and the sorrow of the patriots who had passed away - howling and moaning like werewolves until morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantively different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It's a fairy tale about one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fable: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujanu.
There's a bitch lying there, with a gray box on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell a long time ago, and we were drawing lots - what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it in the free influx of inspiration?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such a depth and in such a breadth that it completely transcends our horizon - and so, of course, we are doing exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die in defense and acquisition of new personal territories.
Sometimes there is a breakdown and we radiate compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various malfunctions, standing on the shores of the ocean of unconsciousness and catching tides of wet wind in a holey sheet made of a dirty handkerchief.
I have to write to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama gave up on his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Referring to hundreds of thousands of statements of statements from providers, Republicans have in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama slipped away from his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have functioning health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Considering what he called a “press riot” about the announcements, Obama urged the Americans who received the announcements to look for new insurers in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be surprising that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m telling these Americans the truth: you deserve something better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online market had been "poor" since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Annoyed, Sebelius uttered the sentence, which was captured by the microphone on, yesterday to an adviser sitting behind her at a Committee meeting yesterday, following a turbulent exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, on whether she herself should be involved in Obama's care program.
For more than three hours during the Sebelius hearing, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance and bought the program through HealthCare.gov, which now imposes on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be calling next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the negotiations, and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The announcement of the transaction should come back in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek owns the KKCG group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, the company went on a frequency auction for LTE networks.
And to everyone’s surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company’s desire to infiltrate telecommunications.
But Sazku is now led by a very experienced telecommunications mazack Robert Chv<0xC3><0xA1>tal.
He started as the marketing director of Radiomobile (now T-Mobile), then became the director of Slovak T-Mobile and lastly headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now confessed that she wanted to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
Vodafone would probably not like this, but according to the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, this could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, who will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Saska.
If it succeeds in the tender on LTE networks (as a newcomer can auction a specially designed spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not mind raising only a limited spectrum (there are not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will release Sazka into its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built 900 MHz LTE network), enabling the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
Vodafone could then spend the money it saves on a fixed-line internet provider or cable TV provider.
What about Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) and immediately get a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big moloch that will wait for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would acquire LTE networks for O2 and very likely in synergy with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will share the network.
The auction could finally be a success, but probably not with the high sums that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Is there ever going to be a TV show without signing up?
The era of President Zeman has entered the legendary scene with an ashtray, so it is not difficult to listen to complaints that collect documents of the encroachment of the castle company.
In the past, no one has documented the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k, let alone signed it.
True, the editors stood up for the leadership.
However, the cases described do not answer the question of where such an inclination of some journalists to the Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of inappropriate empathic affiliation.
And when we assume general rottenness, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous, power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, are not seeking to change the situation on television.
Those who say that in developed countries there are no attempts to intervene politicians in the broadcasts are true.
However, the truth is that this does not mean that there are no complaints about the public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be their own tendency, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have simply not yet reached this stage of civilization and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps in a country that thinks it is the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of a clumsy situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings stumbles upon one another.
JAN JANDOUREK: The Curse of This Country: Presidents on the Edge of Power
It is almost a rule that at key moments in the country the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk had been physically and mentally five years younger, he would have lived to see the end of his presidency, and the events around Munich would have happened a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after a symbolic resistance, the air force could fly beyond the borders, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could have fled to London right away without fighting hard for its legitimacy.
And most of all, the nation would not have had a hangover from that capitulation to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and he was still in shape during the Munich war, but during the war he was already starting to get uphill and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
If he had done better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
He said: “The president will not be in a position to make decisions.”
But he had to, though it wasn't much of a decision to make with a knife on his neck at Hitler's in the chancellorship.
Until the last days in March 1939, the head of intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, said what should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not proceed so smoothly and with such profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing; they did not believe him, they were afraid.
The human wreck of Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow had commanded him.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda was finally prevented from participating in normalization and had to be deposed, already senile.
That Husak was a helpless and sickly depressed old man made it easier in November 89, but that is the only benefit.
Havel was lucky not to have met him in the office in recent years, he was spared the worst.
Although Klaus is still a fresh tennis retiree, many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks as they look, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe it's a threat, it's just not so visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (historically) good that the president is not quite strong.
But it is not a normal state.
Couldn't we have elected once again, in this country, a president who is acceptable-thinking and acceptable-healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies, or a little fantasizing about extraterrestrial life on earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw away.
In the concept of his quartet, which on November 6th in the big hall of Prague’s Lucerna ends this year’s Strings of Autumn festival, everything is connected with everything.
The jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter's quartet's score is about the current feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues are supposed to play what they are experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film pictures.
This principle, however, is not explained by the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, winner of nine Grammys, former co-star of Miles Davis and today probably the largest living jazz saxophonist - who likes to explain.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of 80, I decided that it was best to be surprised by life.
“Too many people are planning everything and then they’re disappointed when things turn out differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects from Thailand Raised Paris Bar Sales
You may be grinning at insects, but you have no idea that you eat about half a kilogram per year completely voluntarily.
For example, ground in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you also take care of a unique experience.
The insects were first to be placed on the menu in Paris in early October by Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar.
The bar, inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, can be found in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can now eat not only various larvae, locusts or water bugs, but also scorpions can taste here.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (so that the insects do not damage their wings, their legs or their eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is still learning to eat insects, but elsewhere it is common.
The owner of the Paris bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons why to consume insects.
The first is the environmental benefit, because insect production is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not abandon his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, the right restaurant makes the pleasure, the feeling of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just making a new experience," he said.
Not everyone would be impressed by the idea of eating a pesto-decorated beetle, but the response of Paris bar customers to the insects served is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics, they say, will eventually taste, even if they start with the smallest bites and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and the state’s lack of interest in dealing with the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings Programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens who, after the implementation of the measures, will save significant amounts for heating, but also opportunities for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 new jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, leverage and multiplier effects are significant, and this is also one of the most significant pro-growth measures.
Therefore, the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program so that further challenges can be announced within its framework.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog summed up the carpet, the president tripped and ended up on the crutches
On Thursday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague, where he spent the night in bed, and left for the chateau in L<0xC3><0xA1>ny.
What health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said U.S. espionage “has gone too far.”
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases, the espionage “has gone too far.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilots” in light of the intrusive revelations about NSA espionage that emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The leaked information sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr Kerry said in a video message at an open government conference in London: “There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government really learned about some of the things that happened because of inertia, because that option was, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War and then of course 9/11.”
He was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but stressed that it had not violated anyone’s rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify it to people, and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that abuse has taken place.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was striving for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and blow people up and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happened?
In fact, we have prevented planes from crashing, buildings from blowing up and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage and to convince Europeans that they need to continue to pool their forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because they were disillusioned with the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance.
It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europe stays on the same boat with us, given our joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger at the NSA programs.
News reports that the NSA collected millions of phone records in Europe disrupted relations with some of America’s allies, even though the agency’s chief said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata that NATO allies collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents leaked by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the Allies’ espionage as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office was planning a parliamentary trip to take place this year, and hoped that members of both parties and chambers would appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said the program is still being worked on.
Although Murphy said the trip’s goal was to help repair relations, he added that “well-meaning educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spy programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland this weekend, as planned, to respond to the hostility that the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities, has instigated.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 with wrongdoing by a Phuket court when she told Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, had attacked her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial television recording later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford two days before she learned she had fabricated the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney-based Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about her daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
“Obviously it’s a tough time, but we hope they come back to us safely as soon as possible,” said Tunks.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she was on holiday in a holiday area in Krabi, southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand claim that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that the appeal could lead to court proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in her being jailed for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to correct a flawed image for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.
Jagr joked: Naked from a breech?
He won a puck in the defensive zone and was never caught again.
In addition, the leak turned after a quick forehand call.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jagr scored against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday night he commented on the 119th winning goal in the NHL on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Peter Svoboda was contacted by the director of the Czech Railways and asked if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!" he wrote at the beginning with an exaggeration.
They say we look a lot like each other.
I guess I'm gonna have to quit my night training so I don't get any faster.
"I'm afraid that the Minister of Defense will call after that and would like to do an advertisement for the jets!" he added.
In addition, New Jersey scored a second victory in a row.
"And most of all, you have noticed - the treatment by Maria Rottrov<0xC3><0xA1> works," Jagr concluded.
Place of post-election candle post-election stew
The October elections, rather than the winner, brought a bunch of losers.
They are not only parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOC), but also previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the CSSD because of their internal schism.
Politicians served us post-election goulash instead of the holiday candlestick on the weekend.
The movement of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> became the jumper of the elections, which promised voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party is recorded politically (due to) because of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported.
Although the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians due to an unpleasant event, he still has a few ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the chances of winning the Prime Minister’s seat in my eyes are getting further away, the entrepreneurs are approaching Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The post-election development is still miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the communist-backed left-wing government of the CSSD, this development is still better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore for the economy.
Given the loud opposition of YES to get together with the ODS or TOP 09, the most likely variant of the coalition is still the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL (a total of 111 MPs).
Due to the split in the CSSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak partner in the negotiations, the outcome of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the CSSD.
A minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD composed of "non-Zemanians" at the Castle will probably not pass.
Moreover, any government in which the CSSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not on our own for another early election?"
The next election would rather be a referendum on the strength of the YES electoral mandate.
The plans of the CSSD for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a significant increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank fell hopefully under the table.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, to support entrepreneurship, moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), support the employment of disadvantaged persons, reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The friction areas are most prevalent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES now has the upper hand, so the program of the most likely coalition YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would lean more to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than the left-wing tax program on everything that is still moving in the economy.
