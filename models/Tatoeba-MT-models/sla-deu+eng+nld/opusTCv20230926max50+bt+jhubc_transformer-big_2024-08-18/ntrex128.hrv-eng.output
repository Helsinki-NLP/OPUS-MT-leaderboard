Welsh MPs are worried they will “look like Muppets”
Some Assembly Members (AMs) were appalled by the proposal that they could be called Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWPs) in the future.
This was due to plans to rename the parliament to the Welsh parliament.
Members of parliament from all political spectrums are concerned that they may become the object of reproach.
One MP from the Labour Party said his group was concerned that the name "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
The MP from the Wales Party (Welsh: Plaid Cymru) said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and proposed alternative solutions.
The Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to changing the name, but that the MWP in speech could quickly turn into Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently preparing a law to introduce a name change, announced the following: "Of course, the final decision on how MPs will be titled will be on their own."
The Law of the Government of Wales of 2017 gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that came across broad support for changing the name of the Parliament to the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the name of the deputies in the Parliament, the Committee was inclined to be called "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or MWPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support during the public consultation.
MPs are proposing alternative options, but the fight for consensus could bring headaches to parliament speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on changes within weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the way Parliament functions, including rules on disqualification of Parliamentary deputies and the establishment of a committee system.
During the debate on the law, parliamentarians will have a decisive vote on the question of what they want to be called.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether they want to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The purpose of the vote is to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, where there is a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the annexation of Greek territory and has repeatedly objected to the opening of its accession process to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the referendum decision.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change of name is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin were silent as the churches of Harlem struggled to survive.
“The older people I spoke to said that in the past you could find a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Today, people are socializing in a different way,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people regularly stay.”
When it comes to churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as church leaders think, and “sooner or later it will find itself back in the beginning.”
He added that churches could replace residential buildings with apartments where people would live who would not help the remaining churches in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and therefore the day will come faster when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that the residents who move into these apartments will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis—the Metropolitan Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church ten years later.
The original white Methodist congregation emigrated in the 1930s.
A black congregation that held worship services nearby took ownership of the building.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who also led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed hiring or promoting blacks.
The fire of 1939 severely damaged the building, but as the parishioners of Reverend Johnson planned to rebuild it, they ordered a series of bells, the so-called carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July used another name: "cultural treasure" and "indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, noted that it was also the first carillon in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who has been playing on a larger carillon at Riverside Church for 18 years.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What is happening in St. Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom were brought by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, the governing body of the parish composed of lay people, wrote to the diocese in July amid concerns that the diocese would "seek to shift costs" to the sacristy, although the sacristy was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Sea Dog Injures 13-Year-Old During Lobster Diving in California
According to the official statement, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster in California on the day of the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about an hour and a half on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s distress call, and then he and the group rowed to the attack site to help get him out of the water.
Hammel said he initially thought it was an excitement about the lobster being caught, but then realized he was shouting, “He bit me!
“He bit me!”
Hammel said that when he approached the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone was torn.
“I got myself out of the water so everyone could get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Rescue team captain Larry Giles told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper body.
Authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablado to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours to conduct an investigation and ensure the safety of swimmers.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to chains such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by introducing department store-style cosmetic countertops and hiring specialized retailers.
As part of a major <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market entry in the UK, which continues to grow alongside a decline in sales of clothing and home furnishings, larger cosmetic countertops will be tested in 11 stores across the country and expanded to additional stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in cosmetic products is one way supermarkets try to take advantage of the shelf space that was once intended for TVs, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury’s representatives said they would double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
And the existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will get more space with areas for certain brands similar to stores like Boots.
At the same time, the supermarket is relaunching its range of Boutique Decorative Cosmetics, so most products will be suitable for vegans, and this is what younger customers are increasingly looking for.
Fragrance Shop will also test concessions in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first to open last week in Croydon, South London, and the second to open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and returning to the daily purchase of small amounts of food at local grocery stores means that supermarkets have to make more efforts to attract people.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said that outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to resist bargains like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as a large number of Habitats divisions, because two years ago it bought both chains, which it claims has spurred the sale of food products and made these acquisitions more profitable.
A previous attempt by a supermarket to refresh its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments has not been successful.
Sainsbury's entered into a joint venture with Boots in early 2000, but this ended in a dispute over the distribution of pharmacies' revenues in its supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical business in 281 stores to Lloyds Pharmacy’s Celesia three years ago for <0xC2><0xA3>125m.
Lloyds will play a role in the plan by including a range of luxury skin care products, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to provide a more comfortable environment for our customers.
We have also invested in a special training of colleagues who will be at hand to customers and give them advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and available locations mean that we are now an attractive destination for the purchase of cosmetic products, which will lead to a change in old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragon’s Den Peter Jones left to “cook with rage” after TV host Holly Willoughby gave up an <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract with his brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of homewear and Truly fashion accessories.
Their brand is compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The show's host, This Morning, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon’s Day star Peter Jones cooking out of anger by pulling out of a joint lucrative job at the last minute to focus on her own new great deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “out of his mind” when a golden television girl during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million contracts meant there was no longer enough time to devote to their brand of homewear and Truly fashion accessories.
This job was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and was supposed to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term investment in the future that would secure it for the next few decades.
Her decision to retire stunned everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday so close to launching the entire line.
At the headquarters of Marlow, the warehouse is full of goods that are ready for sale.”
Experts believe that due to the departure of show host This Morning, one of the stars in Britain in which it is most profitable to invest, the company could suffer millions of losses due to the large funds invested in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes, and the possible further delay in launching the line.
And that could mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spends their holidays together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We don’t want to comment on his business activities.”
Difficult negotiations, and then we fell in love
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the newspapers for comments that some might consider "unworthy of the president" and for having such a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
“Why did President Trump make so many concessions?”
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I have not made any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore on Saturday, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North had not noticed a "appropriate reaction" from the United States to North Korea's disarmament activities.
He noted that instead, the US has not yet lifted sanctions aimed at further pressure.
In his speech at the summit, Trump took a much more optimistic stance.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We are at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We have a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results — halting missile launches, helping to free hostages, and bringing the remaining U.S. troops home.
He also defended his unusual approach to explaining his relationship with Kim.
It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of waiting for 10,000 people in front of this crowded arena to enter, we would have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people directly in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, a precondition for the use of international aid resources.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they were very clear about not seeking international help, so all this is a bit problematic,” Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the Office for National Disasters, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to engage in relief efforts.
Due to the constant shaking of the soil in Indonesia, this country is still sadly unprepared to cope with the wrath of nature.
Although shelters in the event of a tsunami were built in Aceh, this is not something that is common in other parts of the coastline.
The absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid, probably contributed to the loss of life.
And at the best time, traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is not easy.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palo, but it takes at least three days to reach the site of a new disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's crumbling structure was the cornerstone of President Joko Widodo's election campaign and a lot of money was invested in roads and railways.
But the state administration under Joko is struggling with a lack of funding, and next year new elections are being held.
Joko also faces pressure from the remaining sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs battle on the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored a goal for a tie against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a defeat in the Premier League game against Chelsea on Saturday, scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received the addition from Xherdan Shaqiri while he was about 30 meters away from Chelsea's goal with a 1-0 score for Chelsea.
He switched the ball to his left leg before kicking it to the opposite tripod.
The ball flew high above the goal towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball eventually escaped Kepaya Arrizabalagaya, who jumped towards her and entered the net.
“It was challenging to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get as close to the goal as possible, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and I only touched the ball once. I didn't think too much about it and I just shot."
Chelsea led in the semi-finals 1-0 after a goal by Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> during that match before turning somewhere in the middle of the field and running into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made a quick addition in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a beautiful passing ball that led Hazard to the goal.
Hazard circumvented the defense and hit the ball with his left foot in the net on the opposite side of Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool play a club competition match against Napoli in the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Sao Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will welcome Videoton to the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the state disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
A spokesman for Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that a large number of people had been reported trapped in the ruins of buildings after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake felt on Friday that caused waves as high as 6 meters.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is filled with the remains of demolished buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was fatally stabbed.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 07:55 with stab wounds on Grayson Mews in John Street, and the 32-year-old was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called in people from the area to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hogan said: “The investigation is still underway, but I would like everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras, to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and that she was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene who believe they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are also in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.
A taxi driver living on Grayson Mews had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one should enter or exit the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now told it will take several hours before they can return to their homes.
The policeman allegedly told someone that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
The woman appeared at the scene of the crime in tears.
He keeps saying, "That's so terrible."
At 14:00 there were two police vans in the fenced area, and another was parked directly outside.
A large number of police officers stood inside the fenced area and monitored the apartment block.
Anyone with any information was asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, citing Minutes 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in parliament is the latest monument to be found in the middle of a debate about "remaking history"
His persecution would be poetic justice for the near-Taliban destruction of so many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's company called Mr. Crick's attempt "stupidity" and "an attempt to remake history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate currently under way over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s character in front of the Palace of Westminster would become the subject of debate.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars is not something Cromwell ordered or carried out.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The beautiful revival of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a person many still consider worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, a defender of parliament against external pressure. Of course, in his case it was the pressure of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely credible opinion is the subject of a historical debate that continues.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
"His achievements as Lord Protector continue to be worthy of honor and commemoration."
Pig Killer Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man named "Yuan" was found dead of a severed artery and covered in blood near a stall at a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the Southern China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pigs on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at a market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring piggy bank was open.
He said there was a big male pig in the barn with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic examination confirmed that a pig weighing 250 kilos bit the breeders to death.
Guiyang's evening news reported that a relative named "Wu" said: "My cousin's legs were bloody and crippled."
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Yuan didn't belong to him or his cousin.
The market manager told Vecernje Novosti that the pig was locked in order to prevent it from attacking someone else while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market administration are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, swine attacks on humans have already been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her wife on their farm in Massachusetts and her husband suffered life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
“They’re just playing.
They bite, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
They just need to show respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa bring heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As reported, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it crosses the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will bring flooding rains over the next few days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 05:00 Eastern time, Rosa was blowing at 140 km/h, making it a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, an area of low pressure is being created over the Pacific and is moving towards the West Coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push a deep layer of tropical moisture northward towards the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture in interaction with the approaching low-pressure area will cause heavy precipitation in much of the southwest.
In local areas, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous torrential flooding, muddy torrents and possible landslides in the desert.
A deep layer of tropical moisture will cause precipitation of approximately 50 to 75 mm per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As much as 25 to 100 mm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Flooding is possible with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to go on foot to the desert because of the danger of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain could turn the canyons into wild rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local storm winds and dust whirlwinds.
The approaching low-pressure areas will bring local heavy rains on parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which can cause less muddy torrents and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the wet season in the region.
Dispersed tropical showers will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday night and early on Monday morning before covering a wider area at the end of the day on Monday and Tuesday.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will spread to the area where the borders of the states of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah touch and last all day on Wednesday.
In October, large temperature changes are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, but the tropical parts will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic temperature differences in the central United States.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri, Omaha in Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moins in Iowa is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the residual summer heat will continue to grow and expand again.
In most of the central and eastern U.S., early October is expected to be warm with 27 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the tense testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, a woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political crackdown continued, with reporters interrupting a regular program to inform of a last-minute turnaround that Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an ardent testimony that he was absolutely certain that this had not happened.
The hearing on Friday was likely followed by more than 20.4 million people, the number stated in the Nielsen report.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other networks that broadcast the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring the number of people watching content in offices.
To give you a better impression, we are talking about an audience that is similar in number to the audience that is watching the playoffs of American football or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose guests in the studio strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest number of viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen said CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
There was still a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake played a central role in the drama that took place on Friday.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that it would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded him being yelled at by protesters as he tried to take the elevator to a Justice Committee hearing.
For a few minutes, he was staring down as demonstrators slammed him in front of CNN's live cameras.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to this country?"
They said to him, “You have power while so many women are helpless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement before the elevator door closed that he would say more at the committee hearing.
A few hours later, all cable and television networks were watching live as the Justice Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so on condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate over the next week, as demanded by the Democrats in the minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons, and then a few more senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision was important because it was obvious that the Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and undermining the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, continued to criticize her so-called Chequers Brexit plan in a second interview in the same issue on the cover, saying the proposal that the UK and the EU should charge each other tariffs was “complete nonsense.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspected gunman, Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and detained on charges of negligent homicide, Baton Rouge Police said.
Officials posted a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims had lost his glasses in the clash.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Wayde and killing him.
A $350,000 bail was requested.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office on Friday released a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head through the neck.
The police department thanks the Louisiana State Police fugitives task force, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local authorities for enforcing the law for “perseverance and the search for the truth.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played basketball for the LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "desperate" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"That's what we always worry about," Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash into Mexico City
The ashes ejected by the Popocatapetl volcano have reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after intensified activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by multiple rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity from a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 quake rocked central Mexico in 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with emergency police and thousands joined anti-demonstrations to mark Catalonia's polarizing secession vote.
A group of masked separatists who were prevented by the intervention police began to shoot police officers with eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that would otherwise have been flooded with tourists.
The fighting also broke out later in the day when police used batons to calm the fighting.
Over the course of several hours, independence groups chanted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", and the Unionists shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were admitted to hospital for minor injuries sustained during the demonstrations, the local press said.
Tensions in the independence-seeking region have not eased for a year since the October 1 referendum that Madrid declared illegal, which Catalan separatists celebrate.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence even though the turnout was low because those who opposed the secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year after police tried to stop voting in polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on the streets on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstrations were held, but the protesters were forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the separatist demonstrations along with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best times.
I watched my parents weep with happiness for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a key, though close, victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalonia’s independence parties are struggling to keep up this year as their most prominent leaders are in self-imposed exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising referendums and subsequent declarations of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed demonstrations on his phone in support of police, said the clash was sparked by politicians from both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has announced he will run for election to the European Parliament next year, told the inquest prison since the end of last year.
"Candidating for the European elections is the best way we can announce the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man Arrested After Driving Into House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at around 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the yard door and the building itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point an arrow from a crossbow was fired at the car.
Menge scored Livingston's victory over the Rangers with a score of 1:0
Dolly Menge's first goal for Livingston was a win.
The new Scottish Premier League club, Livingston, surprised the Rangers and forced Steven Gerrard to admit his second loss in 18 games at the Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Menge's score proved decisive as Gary Holt's team matched up with the Iberian in a second.
Gerrard's team is still without a win in the Premier League this season, and next Saturday they play against Hearts, the leading club in the league, which is eight points behind.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has increased his line of victories to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunity against dead guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead even before they scored that goal, since their directness in the attack caused a whole series of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but he was too slow on his way to the goal, and after that Alan Lithgow could only point the ball wide after slipping in to intercept a blow to Craig Halkett's head towards the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties for the guests
And that's how the key goal was achieved.
The Rangers failed to stop the free kick, and Livingston devised the opening, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson assisting Mengi who scored in the middle of the goal.
By that point, the Rangers were mostly in control of the ball, but faced impenetrable home defense, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly out of business.
This continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to defend the shot.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs were thwarted by Scott Pittman, and Lithgow sent a broad blow from another organized attack by Livingstone.
Long additions failed to cross the Livingstone goal line, and two eleveners were not awarded – after Halkett's clash with substitute player Glen Middleton and one for handball.
“Great” by Livingstone – analysis
Alasdar Lamont from the Scottish BBC in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Great game and the result of Livingstone.
All of them were excellent, which continued to exceed expectations on this entry path.
Their style of play and staff have barely changed since their return to the big clubs, but great credit goes to Holt and the way he has united the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was brilliant at the head of an excellently organized defense, and Menga did not allow Connor Goldson and Joe Worral to have a rest throughout the game.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They were far from the standards set by a good game under Gerrard.
They failed to finish the ball. They only opened a hole in the home team once and this is a kind of invitation to break out for the Rangers who are in the middle of the ladder.
Erdogan welcomes mixed feelings in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th) everything was full of smiles under the clear sky when the leader of Tours and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police blocked a crowd of 25,000 people outside the mosque, but a large number of the president's supporters showed up to see him.
And hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – including a large number of Kurds – have raised their voices by condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The clashes reflect the division caused by a visitor who is celebrated by some German Turks as a hero and attacked by others as an autocrat.
Road crash in Deptford: cyclist fatally injured in car crash
A motorcyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford in the southeast of the city around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision took place several months after another cyclist was fatally injured after the crash and the driver escaped from the scene of the accident in Chiders Street, about a kilometer and a half from Saturday's crash site.
City police said police officers were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus traffic has been diverted due to the accident, and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Injured in Riots
The prison administration said six police officers were injured in riots in a male-type prison.
Riots broke out at Long Martin Prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special “Tornado” units were brought in to contain the riots involving eight prisoners and are confined to one wing.
Police officers on the spot were provided with assistance due to minor injuries to the face.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff have been recruited to handle the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we want to make it clear that all those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they could spend more time behind bars.”
The Long Lartin prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager ended up in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, emergency police were called to prison to resolve a serious situation in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with torrential flooding (possible benefit for arid areas)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa relentlessly crosses the Desert Southwest and brings the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona, across southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is due to approach Phoenix late Monday in the rain and cross right over it on Tuesday.
The National Hydrometeorological Service of Phoenix tweeted that “since the 1950s, only ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or depression within 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) passed 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts 50 to 100 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts of up to 150 mm at the Mogollonian edge of Arizona.
In other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the Rocky and Great Basin, there is a probability of precipitation from 25 to 50 mm, with possible isolated total volumes up to 100 mm.
For those outside the risk of torrential floods, Rosa could come as a rescue as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a great danger, some of these precipitations could be useful because there is currently a drought in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drylands Map, just over 40 percent of Arizona is affected by at least extreme drought, the second-highest category,” the report said.
The hurricane's path first approached the coast along the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, Rosa still had hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 130 km/h and was located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, moving north at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm hit the colder waters of the Pacific and weakened.
Therefore, it is expected that Monday afternoon or evening will approach the coast of Mexico with the power of a tropical storm.
Rain in parts of Mexico could be severe and pose a significant risk of flooding.
"The amount of total precipitation expected in the area from the Baja California peninsula to northwest Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, a possible maximum of 250 mm," the report said.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression that will then pass through Arizona and into southern Utah by late Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is very heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula, in the northwest of Sonora and in the American Desert Southwest," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening torrential floods and mud torrents in deserts and landslides on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
At around 04:00 BST on Saturday, an injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset police said the 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Police have called for anyone with a videotape of the incident to be heard.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered the Anger and Anger of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the brutal and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual assault decades ago when they were teenagers.
And Christine Ford testified at the hearing about the accusation she made.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage."
“The vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a judge with a flawless career in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president touched on Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republicans going to the polls in the mid-term.
“Five weeks separate us from some of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I am,” he said.
That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican aide told CNN that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami continue to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, with a large number being dragged by the huge waves that hit the coast when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday as waves up to six meters high struck the coast at dusk, drawing many of them to their deaths and tearing everything down in their path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately run and were killed," Sutop Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster alleviation agency, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trunks, houses, it hit everyone on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami crossed the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
“Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived,” he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show numerous destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent strikes continued to shake that coastal town on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes could be felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday corresponded to the two-hundredths of the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It states that the geographical location of the city at the end of the long and narrow bay may have increased the strength of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were considered missing.
According to Nugroh, the number of casualties and damage may be higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala that is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications have been completely cut off and we have no information from Donggal."
"There are more than 300,000 people living in the area," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers had moved to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but the situation could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received a lot of criticism for failing to provide information that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials say the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building is panicked to warn people down the street about an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed to the shore, carrying buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused communication cuts around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still need food and other necessary supplies.
The city's airport is reopened only for humanitarian activities and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centers in Palu on Saturday.
The tsunami in Indonesia has claimed more than 800 lives.
The situation is extremely bad.
“Although World Vision staff from Donggala have successfully arrived in the city of Palu, where employees are sheltered in tarpaulin tents placed in the backyard of their office, they have passed on the destruction scenes along the way,” Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a number of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely difficult.
Although humanitarian groups have launched aid wheels in the disaster, some have claimed that foreign aid workers with great expertise have been prevented from coming to Pal.
Under Indonesian law, funding, supply and recruitment of personnel from other countries can only begin if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government says ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but such a state of affairs has not yet been declared.”
When Palu fell on the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still considered missing still hoped that their loved ones would be one of those miracles that mitigate black-scenarios of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Saturday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the rubble next to her mother's body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's state paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of those captured at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Peter Mandaghi, were his students.
“Given the many years spent in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon recalled that after the news of the demolition of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages are still marked with a gray check mark, instead of two blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
The thieves took away $26,750 while charging ATMs in the center of Newport on the Levee
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who charged an ATM in Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement that the driver of the car had emptied an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to fill it with a new amount of money.
While he was busy with it, another man “came into the race behind Brink’s employee’s back” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be put in an ATM.
Witnesses have spotted several suspects fleeing the scene of the theft, but police have not indicated the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West has changed his name to 'Ye'.
Rapper Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday, he announced the change, saying: "A living being officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change comes ahead of his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
The show's authors said it replaced singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons".
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year in an interview with radio host Big Boy about the title of his album.
“So I am you, I am us, that’s us.
It started with Kanye, which means “one,” in just Ye – it’s a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused, everything in us.
The album itself is actually a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
And West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, played with versions of his name without a hyphen and with a hyphen and written in capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against citizens
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against citizens as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of its bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Square that he would "never use an army against the Mexican people."
Military units fired during peaceful demonstrations in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people as leftist student movements began to spread across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to those studying and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of education opportunities were attracting young criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence (AI)
“As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount it invests in research in this area,” said Kai Fu Leeu, an artificial intelligence investor and expert in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment came after various parts of the U.S. government announced plans for artificial intelligence, although the U.S. lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence in principle.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: It aims to become the first country in terms of AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are looking for the next big AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
“Doubling investment could double the chances of the next big AI achievement in the U.S.,” Lee told CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American game player Othello, and later served as the director of Microsoft’s research department and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as Defense Advanced Research Projects, the Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to find new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state scholarships.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the brightest minds from the university to work on artificial intelligence research in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I believe that PhD students in the field of artificial intelligence should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
China’s state council has announced a plan to develop next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
“China’s National Endowment for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals in academic institutions similar to how the National Endowment for Science and other government organizations provide funding to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to involve business partners and the academic community, and the White House announced the establishment of the Artificial Intelligence Committee.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
When it comes to NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that wanted to establish the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been doing nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change their country's name
Macedonian citizens voted on Saturday in a referendum on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia". This is a move that could resolve a dispute with Greece that has been going on for decades and which has led Greece to block the opening of negotiations for accession to the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a province called Macedonia and Greece claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents the seizure of its territory and has vetoed the country's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and a campaign to boycott the vote cast doubt on whether the turnout would meet the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership while accepting the deal with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying to allow Macedonia, one of the countries created after the breakup of Yugoslavia, to join bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I came to vote for the future of the country, for young Macedonia so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska (79) in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect it to be considered decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared with 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters voted.
"I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko joined a referendum in Strumica on September 30, 2018, to change the country's name, which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join.
The 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage in front of parliament in Skopje and held up chairs in front of a tent set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not as servants," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to receive us under the name of Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, a country where the unemployment rate exceeds 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will support the referendum, since more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a “positive” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research shows that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will join the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
A second survey, conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of that number, 70 percent said they would support the referendum.
For a referendum to be successful, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it took office in May last year.
Manchester City player Sergio Aguero goes through the entire defense of Brighton to score a goal
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's defenses at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and won 2–0 for Manchester City.
Aguero made the win insanely simple, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield addition at the start of the attack.
He broke through three players in Brighton's defense and then landed on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four opponents in green shirts.
He bypassed one defender and then overtook a few more on the edge of Brighton's space.
Then he added the ball to the left towards Sterling.
The English striker from the first attempt returned the ball to Aguera, who threw the right dice ball into the right side of the net and defeated Brighton's goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some foot problems," Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We wanted to play for 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We are very happy to have scored at that time.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Sky Blues their initial advantage in the Premier League.
That goal was scored in the 29th minute.
During this game, Aguero won the ball deep on Brighton's court.
He beautifully added the ball to Leroy Sane along his left flank.
Sane pushed the ball several times before leading Sterling towards the tripod.
The Sky Blues attacker threw the ball into the net just before it slipped into the car.
Manchester City is battling Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to stop Rockies
Since the Nationals players were eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to insist on a new start.
But always competitive Scherzer hopes Sunday's win against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have the advantage of one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West, get into play-offs.
On Friday night, the Rockies secured a 5–2 win over the Nationals, but they still hope to win their first title.
“Although we play for nothing, we can at least throw knowing the atmosphere here in Denver with a lot of fans, and the other team would play at the highest level I would have seen this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete?”
The Nationals have yet to announce Sunday's starter, but are reportedly willing to offer Scherzer a chance to play.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, warmed up in the pitcher area on Thursday and will play on Sunday, when he usually rests.
Desnjak from Washington this season scored 18 : 7, the average of won runs (ERAs) of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 two-thirds changes.
Trump at a rally in West Virginia
During a speech on the importance of the Republican voter turnout in the general election, the president quizzically commented on his choice of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court Justice.
“Everything we’ve done will be tested in November.
It's still five weeks until one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the big, big ones – I didn’t run, but I’m actually in the race and that’s why I’m everywhere to fight for great candidates,” he said.
“You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it’s happening right now.
Their intention is to take back power in any way; you see evil, corruption.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over in order to take power and control; therefore they want power and control, and We will not give them."
The Democrats, he says, have a mission to “resist and interfere.”
“You’ve seen that over the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “angry, evil, corrupt and lying.”
He won Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her response?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for the document - it was really bad body language, worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer accepts differences of opinion.
Does not tolerate making personal bets
I was not too surprised when Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me.
Finally, I am the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome – all because we have said what is on our minds.
According to my MP, Joan Ryan behaved similarly because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was criticized in the proposal for censorship for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically similar topics on which Jeremy Corbyn disagreed with the previous leadership.
The announcement of the Nottingham East branch meeting on Friday said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of the eight years I have been working as a local Labour Party representative, the meetings of the General Council on Friday nights have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, nowadays many meetings take place in a different tone, and the promise of a “kinder, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if its fulfillment ever began.
It has become increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and each opinion is assessed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as collaborators who I thought shared similar political views began to demand a drastic change of mind and an attitude that I would otherwise never agree with – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I address the public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there’s a ton of insulting words on social media calling for my impeachment, renouncing the center’s policies and telling me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I know I’ve had more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments I’ve received are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face an avalanche of sexist or racist comments on a daily basis, but never give up.
One aspect of this political era that has disappointed me the most is the tolerance of offensive speech.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
Reality tells us that we no longer respect different opinions and that with each proposal of no confidence or change of electoral rules we become an increasingly narrow-minded party.
“Many times in the last two years I’ve been advised to bend my head, not to be so loud, and told that everything would be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the neglect of the government of Margaret Thatcher, who left my school multi-purpose classroom in ruins, I wanted to provide better public services for those most in need – whether as a local councilor or as a minister in government.
I've never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be misled about my political positions and the area of disagreement with the current leadership.
All I would say to those who supported the proposal on Friday is that, at the moment when the country is grabbing towards Brexit that will have a negative impact on households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituencies, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of impeachment or political gain will deter me from acting as I think it is in your best interest.

Ayr – Melrose: 38 : 17 undefeated Ayr goes to the top
Two late attempts may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
They have now reached the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated of the ten teams.
Ultimately, a superior defense and better use of opportunities led them to victory, and coach Peter Murchie certainly had reason to be satisfied.
“So far we have been tested in every game and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: “Honor Ayr, they took better chances than us.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute by Frazier Climo brought Ayr to the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish player Rory Hughes, who was excluded from the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose the opportunity to raise the score, and Jason Baggot took advantage of the unrealized attempt.
Climo increased Ayr's lead with an eleventh before, at the very half-time, he scored and made a stand-alone attempt to change the score for Ayr at 17:5 on the eve of the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which Baggot realized, reduced the advantage to five points.
There was then a long hiatus due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on a stretcher, and when the game resumed, Ayr continued the good game with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who realized Climo.
Ayra captain Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again forced an additional player to pay, an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the game under heavy pressure.
The side player, however, returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to demolish the Clim who didn't have the ball; from the penalty line, MacPherson made a bet behind Ayr in a full swing of breakthrough.
Climo realized, as he did almost from the start, after Kyle Rowe received a high kick from David Armstrong and sent side player Gregor Henry in the fifth attempt of the domestic team.
The star of the series Still Game seems ready for a new career in the restaurant business
Ford Kiernan, the star of the Still Game series, seems ready to continue working in the service business after it was revealed that he was appointed director of the company's licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's favorite series, which he is a screenwriter and one of the stars, along with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last to be shown, and it seems that Kiernan plans to dedicate his life after Craiglang.
According to the official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although one source for Scottish Sun hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in “the growing restaurant business in Glasgow.”
"The Sea is Ours": Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, hopes that the court will grant it access to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling the nautical center full of cranes in La Paz.
The flag of the color of the ocean is displayed on public buildings.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are winged: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
In all of Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the lost seashore in Chile’s favor during the resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive – just like the longing for re-navigation of the Pacific Ocean.
While Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice expected on October 1, after a five-year trial, those hopes are perhaps at their highest level in decades.
"Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, optimistically awaits the outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on the big screen and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s position that Chile, after decades of demanding negotiations, is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president who faces a controversial battle to be re-elected next year, may also benefit from Monday's verdict.
"We are close to returning the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that little would change if it did.
A UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign Chilean territory and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final hearings, meaning the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Instead of promoting Bolivia's interests, the last four years may have reversed them.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian leadership," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales' belligerent rhetoric has buried all the goodwill of Chile, he believes.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after this it will be extremely difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, disagrees with the view that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as a political cripple.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is an opportunity to see that we need to get through the past.”
North Korea says it won't achieve nuclear disarmament if it can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be able to disarm nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri addressed the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises during a meeting between the leaders of the two opposing countries in Singapore.
The comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears set to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear issues soon, more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the sanctions have continued because of "blasphemous fantasies" and that U.S. opposition to the declaration to end the Korean War will in no way bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to back the declaration without Pyongyang first taking concrete steps to disarm.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s serious intention to give up its arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal that the last line of large headgear is on its way to a luxury store in your neighborhood
Whether you want to upgrade your hat collection or completely cover the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne on the runway presented a line of crazy huge headgear for their spring and summer 2019 collection and delighted style lovers at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have swept Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their creations that attract attention on the runway.
The example that stood out was designed by Valentino, and it is a large beige hat decorated with a wide circumference resembling feathers that completely "taken over" the heads of the model.
Other bulky accessories included watermelons decorated with jewelry, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but these accessories are not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than pieces of high fashion.
One of the creations resembled a diving suit with a windshield and a mask, and the other looked like a cornet with a melted ice cream.
If you follow a great fashion statement – happiness is on your side.
Stylists predict that huge hats could come to luxury stores in your neighborhood.
The huge hats fit perfectly with the heels of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a circumference of about 60 cm that has been seen on many famous people, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the extremely impractical hat that subdued social networks sent another great creation to the runway – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model in the swimsuit who wore it.
The extinguished orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia ribs and a white leather handle, was an exhibition item in the summer collection of Jacquesmus' La Riviera for 2019 at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous and celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags in luxury stores for next summer. Since the designer has made such a strong impression, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for big fashion accessories.”
John Edward: The Language Skills the World's Citizens Need
Scottish independent schools have a tradition of academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, and additional weight is given to this by individual and joint successes in sport, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further education and higher education, a career they want and make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement the mentioned school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in your mother tongue, it goes to his heart.”
This statement is a strong reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build trust and relationships with people from other countries.
The latest results of the final exams this year show that the highest scores in languages were achieved by participants of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages received excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students received an excellent grade for Mandarin, while 72% of students learning German, 69% of students learning French and 63% of students learning Spanish also received the highest possible grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a key skill that children and young people will surely need in the future.
Today, languages as elective subjects are considered as important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, as well as in other places.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers are unable to fill jobs due to a lack of language skills workforce.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming an imperative for preparing young people for careers.
As more and more jobs require language skills, these skills are crucial in a globalised world.
Regardless of career choice, people who have learned to speak a foreign language in the future will feel the benefits of such a long-term skill.
A person who speaks several languages can communicate directly with strangers, and this gives him an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in 2013, 75 % of respondents in the UK do not know a foreign language well enough to communicate in it, and French is the only language that speaks a two-digit percentage of respondents, namely 15 %.
Therefore, investing in language learning is very important for today’s children.
If children learn more languages, especially those of developing countries, they will have more opportunities to find good employment.
In Scotland, every school offers a variety of languages.
Some schools will include classic, modern languages in their curriculum, while others will opt for languages considered to be the most important in the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools he will always have a diverse selection, as well as teaching staff who are professional in the field.
Scottish independent schools provide children with an environment where learners can prepare and equip themselves with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds for us.
One cannot ignore the fact that in today's global business, language skills are very important for the future of every country, so this must also be reflected in education.
Therefore, the knowledge of modern languages should really be viewed as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer language choice, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron will play Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
LeBron James will be playing for the Lakers in Los Angeles.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in his first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one minute and less than 48 minutes,” Walton told the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier this week, James answered questions about his plans for a six-game preseason at the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I really don’t need pre-season games,” he said.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia, a YouTube channel.
President Donald Trump is kicking off the campaign with numerous rallies tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned rallies Trump will hold next week, including short visits to Tennessee and Mississippi.
Trump has not yet cast his vote for a new Supreme Court judge and plans to increase support for the upcoming election as there is a risk that Republicans will lose their majority in Congress after a November vote.
What time does the Trump rally start in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week's hearings of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that have sparked controversy over allegations of sexual abuse. The Senate's confirmation decision has been pending for a week now until the FBI investigation is completed.
But the primary goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain the upper hand in the November election.
Trump's campaign headquarters said the five meetings scheduled for next week were intended to "stimulate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and increase the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," Reuters reported.
“The majority in Congress is so important to the president’s plans that he will travel to as many countries as possible as we enter a turbulent campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Tonight's rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News reports.
Trump will visit West Virginia on Saturday for the second time in the past month. He won in that state in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey from West Virginia, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to help him improve his ranking in the polls," political scientist Simon Haedar of the University of West Virginia told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team left the heart on the field ahead of Sunday's individual clashes
After three one-sided sessions, a couple's match on Sunday afternoon may be exactly what was meant to reverse the Ryder Cup.
"The Wheel of Fortune Turns" is a saying that is especially true in sports and that athletes believe in, and especially in competitions like this.
Who is the wheel of fortune now favored?
“They had six points advantage and now they have four. So I think luck is on our side right now,” Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
The Europeans are in the lead with four points, while there are 12 points remaining until the end of the game.
Spieth says the Americans got a little wind in their backs and were encouraged by his pairing with Justin Thomas, with whom he won three out of four points after a full day's game.
Spieth has played a murderous game from tee to green and can serve as an example to others.
The cheering exclamations became louder when Spieth and Thomas reached two points behind, and everything culminated in a key path that Spieth came to an unsolved result.
After winning the 15-hole game, a similar cheerleader snarl followed, in which one can recognize the hope and faith that the Americans can turn everything around.
“You just have to concentrate and think about your game,” Spieth said.
Now that’s all that’s left for the players.
18 holes and I can celebrate.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a Ryder Cup sensation.
European odd but irresistible couple has the maximum number of points and can not go wrong.
Moliwood is the only couple not to lose a point on Saturday afternoon, but it also avoided bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, as well as back nine on Friday morning.
This winning streak, as well as the incredible energy that connects Fleetwood and Molinari, show that they are exactly the players to be beaten on Sunday. There is no more popular player than the two who can seal the victory of the Europeans as the sun sets over Paris’ Le Golf National.
Maybe they both win at the same time on different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the victory of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly took down Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, who had a great performance in this morning's doubles game.
One bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes in the course buried a Spaniard and a Swede in a hole from which they failed to dig.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help individuals dig out of their hole.
It’s fascinating to watch couples’ games up close because you can see the interactions of the players in the pair, hear the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, as well as study the strategy that can change in an instant.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far, and on the last day they enter with a significant advantage, but this game in pairs has also shown that the US team has the necessary combativity, which some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europeans on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a lead of 10 : 6
Europeans after Saturday's couples games on the last day of the Ryder Cup enter with a significant advantage over the United States of 10:6.
Dynamic duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari with two victories over Tiger Woods led with four points difference at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team in an effort to win the trophy she missed at Hazeltine two years ago was superior to the American team in the morning doubles games, scoring 3–1.
The American team showed greater fighting in pairs by winning two games, but the difference in points was already large.
To win the trophies, teams of Jim Furyk need to collect eight points in 12 individual games held on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European team debut to score four points in a row, while he and Mollinari, known as Molliwood, are just the second pair to score four points in a pairing in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they proved to be superior in the game against Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau in a 5&4 win.
Woods, who did not show the best performance in two Saturday games, made some brilliant moves, but now has 19 defeats out of 29 games in fourballs and pairs and seven defeats in a row.
Justin Rose paused the morning fourballs to return to the doubles with his partner Henrik Stenson and suffered a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki, the world's first and third best players.
But for Europeans, not everything was going so smoothly on a pleasant day southeast of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points on Sunday, setting the ladder high for their American team.
They first defeated Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter with a score of 2&1 in fourballs, and then defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy with 4&3 in pairs after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team that was four points behind managed to return in individual games, although Fury's team only needs an unresolved result to keep the trophy.
After two days in arrears, Sunday's counterattack seems to be hard to come by.
North Korea Says 'No Chance' for Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that further sanctions had heightened distrust in the United States and that there was no chance that North Korea would unilaterally disarm and give up its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea took “significant goodwill measures” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and making a decision to halt the development of nuclear technology and weapons.
"However, we have not received a satisfactory response from the United States," he added.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we don’t have faith in our national security. Under such circumstances, there is no chance that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to a "gradual" approach to denuclearization that would gradually lift sanctions against North Korea, his statement is significant because he has not rejected unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting in the history of the incumbent U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea wants to officially end the Korean War, which lasted from 1950 to 1953, but the United States has conditioned Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons before that.
Washington has also ignored calls to reduce tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization be carried out first and increases pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal, and even opposes a ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is just a misconception of people who know nothing about us.
The main problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases mistrust."
Ri did not mention whether there were plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which the US president spoke about earlier this week at the United Nations.
But the minister noted that Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in had held as many as three meetings in the past five months, adding: "If the denuclearization had been sought by South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a standstill."
In any event, the tone of Mr. Ri’s speech was vastly different from last year when he spoke before the UN General Assembly and said that targeting the continental United States with missiles was inevitable after evil President Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “total destruction” last year at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to disarm, but added that there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday there was no timeline for denuclearization, adding: “It doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia have expressed the view that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must be strictly continued until there is complete, definitive and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in a bid to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second meeting.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but North Korea called him "gangster demands" after a few hours.
North Korea has agreed to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile site and nuclear complex that will take place if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He added that Kim had revealed to him that the “appropriate measures” were related to the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and certain steps toward stabilizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to learn how to rest well
A new course at Harvard University has allowed all students to get a good night’s sleep in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of caffeine- and sleepless night-time learning.
The academic found that students at the world’s best university often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep science at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea for the course came after he gave a speech on the effect of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, “Why did I only find out this now, in my final year of college?”
She said no one told her how important sleep was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and sporting success and generally improve health.
Professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health service, Paul Barreira, said the university decided to introduce the course after students were noticed a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive tasks.
One of these tasks includes a picture of a dormitory where students have to click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books to find out what the effects of caffeine and light are, how lack of sleep affects success, and how important sleep routines are.
During the lecture, students also learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
After that, a map of the campus with interactive icons is displayed that encourages students to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” Czeisler added.
A culture of pride in all-night learning before exams still exists, the professor says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students prove that lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
The professor says that the secret weapon of students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety should be a good and quality sleep. Sleep also helps in the fight against obesity because lack of sleep affects the brain, puts it into a state of starvation and provokes constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student of chemistry and biology from California, helped Professor Czeisler come up with a course after attending his first year of Harvard.
He says the course opened his eyes and inspired him to extend the course to the entire campus.
As the next step, it plans to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study course before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students turn on the alarm during sleep, as well as during waking up. They must be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices, as well as LED lights that can disrupt the circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston – Rangers 1 : 0: Mengin goal defeated Gerrard's boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat after Dolly Menge's goal tore down Steven Gerrard's flawed defense and ended the game with a 1–0 win over Livingstone.
The Ibrox team wanted to make their first away win after a 4–1 win in St. Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, so his team now lags behind eight points in the Ladbrokes Premiership for leading Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers seemed to be left without inspiration and didn't seem to match the score.
While the Rangers now fell to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third with only one point difference behind Hibernian.
There could be new problems for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence sustained a head injury when an object was thrown from a distance.
Gerrard made eight changes to the flanks, and so fought alongside Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livingston line-up that took the Hearts last week and would have been thrilled that his well-thought-out line-up had stifled any attempt by the opponent.
The Rangers may have had the ball in possession more, but Livingston did more with it.
They had the chance to score two minutes after Menga was first kicked out of the game, which opened up space for Scott Pittman to head towards Allan McGregor's goal, however, the midfielder missed the opportunity.
The deep free kick of Keaghan Jacobs was intercepted by Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only pass an imprecise kick to the back rows.
The Rangers took control at one point, but in the final third of the game they seemed to play with hope instead of with conviction.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that the judge should have awarded him an eleventh in the 15th minute after his collision with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson did not heed Columbian's request.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's one shot at Lassane Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's pitomi shot were not a big problem.
Although the 34-minute gameplay of Livingstone slowed down the game, no one can deny them the effort.
The Rangers again failed to take advantage of Jacobs' deep return ball.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept the pretense and chose Menga for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent. The replacement had almost an immediate effect as the wing player added the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly blocked it from his line.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into exactly the kind of game they enjoyed, while Lithgow and Halkett scored one long shot after the other.
Holt's side could have extended the lead in the closing moments, but McGregor effectively disabled Jacobs before Lithgow made a wide angled inlet.
Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, asked for an eleven-year-old again late because he got tangled with Jacobs, but Thomson turned a blind eye this time.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Almanach on Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, 136 years and a few days ago...the birth day of the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, and from this invention later developed a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter has also become a major pillar of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Bells of Colorado, in which the seemingly amazing scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the atoms reacting to the radioactivity in the minerals."
Evans: "Look at that, you can hear it!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Bad Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to 'See' Bad Cells and Destroy Them
“The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing the cells of the immune system from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
Cells are treated to “recognize” the protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injected into the patient.
The experimental vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches her immune system to recognize bad cells, ovarian cancer has receded for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves extracting immune system cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory to know how to “recognize” a protein called HER2, which is common to many types of cancer, and re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer," explains Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune system cells from a patient and “learning” them to recognize cancer cells has been successful in treating one type of leukemia.
Kanye West, after hosting Saturday Night Live, joined Trump’s discussions and supported him by wearing a cap that read, “Make America Great Again.”
Didn't go well
Kanye West was whistled in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an intermittent performance praising U.S. President Donald Trump and announcing that he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song on a night called Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap that read “Make America Great Again,” he went on to speak out against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people so often and they tell me, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago," he said.
Saturday Night Live began with a satirical sketch in which Matt Damon ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although it wasn't broadcast, West's video of the speech was shared on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was trying to make fun of West.
Also, West complained to the audience that he was being played behind the stage because of the hat he was wearing.
“I was being bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go anywhere with that hat."
I've been bullied!
They said I sank," said the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the bottom?" and said that he would wear his Superman cloak because that meant they couldn't tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
Variety magazine wrote that his comments caused at least two public outcry, and members of Saturday Night Live seemed embarrassed, while one person told the magazine: "The whole studio is silent."
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West's performance of the song "I love it", dressed like a bottle of Perrier mineral water, stunned many.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, the head of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people in the world: THANK YOU for marrying the Mafia."
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "his own and that's absolutely wonderful."
But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music, clothing, or supporting his “art”) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, saying he was now "a being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's footsteps, who is also known as Puff Diddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was called Snoop Lion, and of course, the late music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accusation of attempted murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with trying to kill a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear before the Belfast Misdemeanour Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington has turned to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor turned to the stereotype of macho heroes, saying that because of such television roles, boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and asked himself how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie from Game of Thrones, has admitted that he wants to “very resolutely” confront this problem.
“Personally, I feel very determined at this point — where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, in relation to the problem we now see?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to the very masculine characters on the screens, could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes boys feel they have to have these specific traits of a man?
I think that’s actually one of the big questions of our time – how can we change that?
“Something went wrong for the boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not shoot sequels to the Game of Thrones series after its end next summer and said he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will star in a new performance of Sam Shepard's True West theatre play, the story of the film producer and his brother the robber.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him during the filming of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife filming this series, which gave me a family and a future life,” he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Whale character Jon Snow, in a fantastic Emmy-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, a change from the past.
In the past, HIV was rapidly transmitted throughout parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health authorities said that people who become infected with HIV in this way are almost gone.
However, every year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS increases by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is a persistent problem among the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be high.
Research estimates that because of conservative values in the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease in such relationships occur due to inadequate protection during sex.
As part of efforts to tackle the problem, the Chinese government promised free access to HIV medicines in 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member of the public has leaked information about GOP senators, calling it “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Walters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on Wikipedia.
A Los Angeles Democrat says the allegations are being disseminated by "ultra-right wing" individuals as well as websites.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked data reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing over allegations of sexual misconduct by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address revealing the source of the disclosures belongs to the Waters House of Representatives, as well as information about the MP’s staff member, The Hill reported.
"These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false," Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false and untrue allegations – is in no way responsible for the leakage of that data.
These unfounded allegations are completely wrong and absolutely false."
Ms Waters’ statement quickly attracted critics on the internet, including former White House spokesman Ari Fleischer.
"This is an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that Waters has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
Someone who's accused of something he didn't do shouldn't be angry.
He can't be defiant.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
It has to be calm and calm."
Fleischer seemed to compare Barbara Walters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate competing in the general election against Waters, also tweeted.
"It's important if it's true," he wrote.
Waters said in a statement that her office had notified the "relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies" of these false claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are identified and that they bear the legal consequences for all actions that are harmful and dangerous to my entire cabinet," she continued.
"Johnny English: Back on Mission": Rowan Atkinson Fights Spies
It is now common for every new British film to look for messages about Brexit, and it seems to be so in the new adaptation of the action series "Johnny English" whose first sequel, "Johnny English" was first shown in 2003 and returned to the big screen in 2011 with the title "Johnny English Rides Again".
Will a twisted satire of our own about how obviously worthless we are become a new national export opportunity?
The incompetent Johnny English with his eyes out and a rubber face again has permission to complicate situations, while his name tells him more than anything that it is a comical creation for a wide audience designed for countries where cinema is not in English.
He is, of course, a crazy undercover agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions of "diluted" glamour, resembles Inspector Clouseau, has a touch of Mr. Bean's character, and somewhat resembles the guy who sang one note of the opening song "Chariots of Fire" at the 2012 London Opening Ceremony.
His character is also inspired by the traveler and mysterious world man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercials for Barclaycard and who is the epitome of chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this latest release of the film.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is visible, but humor seems rather uninteresting and unusually superfluous, especially now that "serious" film titles such as "007" and "Impossible Missions" offer elements of comedy themselves.
Humor seems to be meant for children, not adults. In my opinion, Johnny English's crazy stories are not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent gegs embodied in the character of Mr. Bean.
The assumption that the UK is in serious trouble is now a widely accepted fact.
The hacker entered Britain's most secretive web of spies and revealed the identities of all British agents, to the horror of an agent on duty, who, unfortunately, is played by Kevin Eldon.
This has spilled a glass of the prime minister’s patience, the arrogant and belligerent character who is experiencing the complete collapse of the system because he is politically hated: Emma Thompson tries to faithfully portray the character she should represent Theresa May, but she hasn’t exactly gotten the material with which to do anything.
Intelligence advisors reveal that all active spies have been compromised and will therefore have to rehabilitate a retired agent.
And that person will be a careless Johnny English head and beard who is currently employed as the headmaster of some fancy school, but secretly teaches how to become a secret agent: there are a few handsome gegs here because English teaches rocker-style spying.
English is quickly brought to government premises for an emergency meeting, where he meets again with Bough, a former partner and his eternal victim, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to an overly enthusiastic submarine commander, played by Vicki Pepperdine, whose potential is largely wasted.
And so two members of Her Majesty's Secret Service who are doing everything completely wrong return to action and meet the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, embodied by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems, the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their exciting journey with absurd and ridiculous stories: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fancy French restaurant, causing a huge mess by smuggling into Volta's luxury yacht, and English challenges complete anarchy by trying to use virtual reality headphones to find out what Volta's interior looks like.
Everything has been done as it should for this last sequel, but as attractive and entertaining as the film is, it still contains a lot of children’s elements.
Quite a mediocre achievement.
And as was the case with other Johnny English films, I wondered again whether the British film industry could not give Rowan Atkinson a role that suited his talent?
The Labour Party has denied a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider a radical plan that would allow the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days of work.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to pass on AI savings to workers and give them an extra day off.
This would mean that employees would have the right to a three-day weekend with equal pay.
Sources say the idea could "fit" into the party's economic agenda and plans to favor the country's workers' interests.
The trade union congress backed the shift to a four-day work week as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
"The four-day working week will not take place overnight, but it represents an aspiration that fits the approach that this Party has towards balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of this Party."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party also promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not fully accept this tendency.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "The four-day working week is not the party's policy and the party is not considering it."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to work out his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to seize power from the hands of "faceless directors" and "profiteers" in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s shadow plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not be able to recoup their entire stake as the Labour government could make “deductions” based on perceived irregularities.
He also confirmed plans to include workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to give 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who would earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency’s conclusion could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was a possibility the FBI would discover something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
“I said going to the hearing, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, after the allegations were made to you, and asked, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, unwavering, unequivocal."
Graham's voice, however, seemed to be carved in stone.
“I’m determined when it comes to Brett Kavanaugh and I really should have a strong accusation to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know the following: Brett has resolutely denied everything,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people she named could confirm her claims.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it achieved anything in terms of poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars and an equally impressive mission – ending poverty in the world.
For the seventh consecutive year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people in Central Park to enjoy not only performances by stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the real goal of the event, ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (unless they were willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to perform a series of tasks or “works” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, phone calls, or any other meaningful ways to raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen actually, given that it has 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince people that they are demanding a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicticism” – where people feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet really changes something?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters striving to achieve a range of different goals.
He argues that these actions were an incentive for world leaders to announce commitments and policies that will lead to more than $37 billion, which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements arising from its activities, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include “The Power of Nutrition”, a partnership of investors and practitioners in the UK that advocates “helping children develop to their full potential”, with the promise that after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens, it will provide $35 million in aid to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the area.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Foundation, told an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions taken to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the “The Power of Nutrition” project, which will provide food interventions for 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on its website, which is: “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responds: “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey, and we’re going to fail sometimes.
But we will succeed, as did the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, because together we are stronger.
The performances of Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among some of the performances at this year's event in New York that will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a “blockade” to prevent Russia’s energy exports
Washington can, “if necessary,” use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in Syria is “particularly where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government” as an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason Russia is in the Middle East is because it wants to sell energy in that area, as it does in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he said.
But in his opinion, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, with the help of the Navy, can ensure the openness of sea routes and blockade, if necessary, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at an event hosted by the non-profit Consumer Energy Alliance, which in the United States presents itself as the “voice of the energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they are actually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as “serving the same trick” in fossil fuel-dependent economies.
The statements were made at the same time as the Trump administration’s intention to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a far cheaper option for European consumers.
In this sense, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During an imminent meeting with citizens in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running herself.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that means a woman at the head,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren gave an opinion on President Donald Trump during a meeting with citizens, saying that “this country is heading in the wrong direction.”
“I’m terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that most Warren’s voters don’t think they should run in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Research at the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent of the vote for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democratic names debated over a potential 2020 presidential race are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD of Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged for an incident of domestic violence that occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through after his return, is comparable to other families who are feeling the consequences of PTSD and other wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told an audience at a gathering of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a general problem that she has been silent about for her son and other war veterans, saying "they come back a little differently, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is any respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the army, have given to this country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing reports of domestic violence, and possessing a gun in an alcoholic state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the review of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and counties submitted a friendly report in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenges policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's lawsuit against Sessions filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys who backed Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the United States, as countries facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Committee that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires all asylum applications to be settled on the basis of the concrete facts and circumstances of the action, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers have also argued that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “ensure the necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland for persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
The purpose of asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems that people face on a daily basis around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“The situation is very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her boy who was shaking in a fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Emergency vehicles bring in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, searching through flooded things, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake were crowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who suffered a fractured back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors for continued severe aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he talked about the feeling of a violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I was crushed inside the wall ruins," Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Missing” Through “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page long ad in the US daily that promoted the mutual benefit of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of misusing the US press to spread propaganda.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid addition to Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials described in a statement to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up commercials to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war that has led to high import tariffs.
China's retaliation at the start of the trade war was designed to hit exporters in countries like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, Branstad states that China “now doubles that bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“Through the spread of its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, at the newsstand on the streets of Beijing you will find limited voices of opposition and you will not see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s disturbing economic trajectory because the media is under strong pressure from the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that "some of China's most prominent newspapers have declined an offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspapers were in question.
Kavanaugh's Republican Debacle Removes Voters from Midterm Elections, Analysts Warn
With many Republicans standing by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and defending him over several allegations of sexual abuse, analysts warn it will lead to negative reactions during the upcoming midterm elections, especially among women.
The emotions surrounding the event have been turbulent, and most Republicans have already shown that they still want to cast their vote.
Such things cannot come back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell University in Syracuse, told an article published on Saturday.
Reeher expressed doubt that Senator Jeff Flake's latest insistence on an FBI investigation would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, neither tomorrow nor November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!”, protesting in the Senate hallway as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee prepared to proceed with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be beyond all expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news.
“People say they’re already at a high level, which is true.
But they could also be higher, especially among women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault by a Supreme Court judge’s nominee, analysts have suggested that there could be a negative reaction if Republicans continue with confirmation.
“It’s a real mess for the Great Old Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting on the committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh was sent to the Reserve Bank, but also about how the Republicans approached it and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news agency.
However, it seems that Americans are somewhat divided about who they will trust after Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a little more leaning towards him.
A new survey published by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford’s testimony to be true, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same for Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating allegations Ford made, along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her in a drunken state when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court judge candidate showed her his genitals at a party during his studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to download Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that aims to become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology, Inrupt, is a company that is developing on the basis of Berners-Lee’s open platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of their data and the people who will be allowed access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal network data storage" or POD.
It may contain contact lists, duty lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique when it comes to personal online data storage is that the decision on who can access which information is fully user-generated.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrupt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the company with the resources, processes and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several engineers who signed a contract to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world were able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change in which all of their business models would completely reverse overnight.
“We’re not asking for their permission.”
Berners-Lee said Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Order of the First World War Priests by the Victoria Cross
A celebration in honor of the only Anglican priest who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a fighter in World War I was held in his hometown 100 years later .
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never found out that he had received Britain's greatest military honor.
The memorial stone was discovered by two of his grandsons at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone would be discovered exactly 100 years after the venture of his grandfather for which he received the recognition.
According to a report by the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the St. Quentin Canal "through very dense fog and under heavy fire coming from the direction of the battlefield and machine guns".
Later, he rushed to the front lines and with "incredible courage" led the unit forward before rushing to the Polish cannon without anyone's help and chopping down three men from the military detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know that I could never achieve, and that stirs humility.”
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to be participating in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown through the support that many people will give."
Fans of mixed martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Peppa Piglet
Imagine this <0xCC><0xB6> you stay up all night watching a series of Bellator 206 matches to end up being disabled from following the main event.
The San Jose program contained 13 fights, including six on the main list, and in the UK they were shown live at night on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for each other’s match, spectators in the UK were shocked when Peppa Pig interrupted the broadcast.
Many were not impressed at all after just staying awake until the early hours of the morning for the sake of fighting.
One fan described the interruption of the children's cartoon on Twitter as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to state regulations, this content is not suitable for broadcast at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the broadcast.
"Jupi, Peppa's Pig."
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said he would align his schedules to include UK viewers in the future.
“When I consider rewriting, I think we can probably sort something out,” Coker said.
“But the transfer is there at six in the morning on Sunday, and we will not be able to realize anything until Sunday, when it will already be Monday, comes to us.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the transmission was interrupted, there were many correspondences circulating that were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it's a state problem.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We're gonna keep five fights instead of six, which is what we normally do, and we've tried to give more to our fans, but we've gone too far.
It's about unfortunate circumstances."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" to sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to become successful.
The twenty-four-year-old said that until he went to high school, he was not aware that “not everyone is like me.”
In a statement to Radio 4's Desert Island Disks, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights in order to give others "hope".
He also said winning the Olympics was less important to him since he became a father.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing as a renegade on Laverne's first show, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "it was not socially acceptable to love both boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and diversity over others have been the right things that have given me the power and strength to succeed."
He said he wanted to prove he was “someone and something” so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The double bronze medalist has become a prominent LGBT advocate and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt he was happy to be able to live openly with no consequences and because he wanted to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said he was surprised to fall in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married an Oscar-winning actor who is 20 years older than he was last year, but said the age difference had never been a problem for him.
“When you’re so young you go through so much,” he looked back at his first Olympics when he was 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, and said it was hard to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, the whole story would have been about me having to win a gold medal," he said.
“You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
"Robbie is my Olympic gold medalist."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father didn’t accept that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they got tickets to London in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t say to him, ‘Daddy, you won’t be here long enough to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand as he exhaled, and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“All I knew was that what I’d dreamed of my whole life was jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for the selection of the first song <0xCC><0xB6> "Proud" by singer Heather Small <0xCC><0xB6> , which echoed in it during the preparations for the Olympic Games , and which he always frets about .
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson out of shape on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
Phil Mickelson will set the record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but will have to fully recover to avoid an inconvenient milestone.
Mickelson, who plays a record 12 times in this two-year competition, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he often was for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day cheering and elaborating his game on the training ground in the hopes of correcting what was troubling him.
Never the most accurate player, not even at the height of his career, this 48-year-old is unprepared for the demanding terrain of Le Golf National, where long uneven terrain routinely punishes inaccurate kicks.
And if the pitch itself isn’t scary enough, Mickelson faces precision British Open champion Francesca Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who won all four matches with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week.
If the Americans, who start 12 individual games with four points less, come to a hot start, Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk said he had confidence in his man <0xCC><0xB6> more than that and could not tell.
“He fully understood the role he had today, he patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“There’s a lot of confidence.”
He is famous and has contributed a lot to the teams in the past, and this week.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I imagined there would be more, but that's how it turned out, and we thought that's what we should do.
He wants to be on the field, like everyone else."
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never really reached the level of his personal achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible value to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s funny, he likes to joke with people and he’s a great guy for the team,” he said.
“I think the younger players had fun with him and this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than a game.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a great advantage in the last day of individual Ryder Cup matches can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where the team of captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but the game ended with their victory with a narrow margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 <0xCC><0xB6> 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that we had a big advantage in Valderrama; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but with a narrow difference,” said Bjorn, in the picture, after watching the team of 2018, which won with a score of 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 on Friday and yesterday led by a score of 10.
So, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow you will play at full strength.
Get out on the field and do everything right.
Nothing's over until the floor on the board rings.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy, and that remains the focus.
I talk all the time, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware of who is standing in front of us, the biggest players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about his players’ performance on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never run in front of a ore in this.
Tomorrow we have to face a different beast.
Tomorrow's the main individual performances, and it's something completely different.
It’s great to play with your partner when everything is going well, but when you’re there as an individual, they’re at the ultimate test of your golf player skills.
It's a message you have to pass on to the players, and it's that tomorrow they have to give the best of themselves.
Now leave your teammates, because he has to do the best he can."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart on the other side, Jim Furyk, will ask his players to play better individually than they did with their teammates, excluding Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of these big upheavals on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser after Europe performed a "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, encouraged his players before the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you should try to achieve excellent results at the start, like what you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this attack takes place in a certain direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the midfielders.
Accordingly, we organized our line-up and placed the boys as if we were going to, you know, try to perform the magic tomorrow."
Thomas is assigned to try to lead the counterattack and face Rory McIlroy in the main match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter to face the other Europeans in the upper half.
I have decided that this group of guys is going in this order because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said of the selected players for the individual matches.
A German warship has been put on hold again.
The latest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era warships, but it will not be ready until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The launch of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the all-new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but worrying issues after the delivery struck the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
As far as is known, it will have a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period <0xCC><0xB6> it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates over a period of up to two years without returning to their home ports.
However, the constant delays mean that state-of-the-art warships, which are said to enable Germany to exercise power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The unlucky frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that would render a warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors half the size of the older Bremen-class frigates.
Also, the ship has been shown to be dramatically too heavy, which reduces its efficiency and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
The price is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) <0xCC><0xB6> compared to the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The problems affecting the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was in fact "running out of ships capable of deploying".
The official said the problem has increased over time, as the old ships have been put out of service and there have been no replacement vessels.
He expressed regret that none of the Baden-Württemberg class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Foundation eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
New research on a Scottish Highlands estate aims to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the results will explain the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
A study conducted by scientists at the National Endowment for Scotland (NTS) will follow common and swampy dwarf bats, as well as brown long-breasted and river bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile inspections using handheld detectors.
A professional analysis of the sound of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat voting and what kind it does.
Then a habitat map and a report will be created to create a detailed picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow formation and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and landscaping works that affect shelters and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flycatchers and certain chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find bugs and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct research, inspections of shelters and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even set up the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Three Mansion in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of the ten bat species that inhabit Scotland.
The manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal area for them.
“We have a huge area for bats here in Threeve,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good habitats.
However, there’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and at other facilities will help us better understand what they need to progress.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking the presence of bats before starting maintenance work inside buildings, since unintentional destruction of one litter can kill up to 400 females and young people, thus probably destroying the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or harass or destroy their shelters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a representative for Scotland's bat protection association, urged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are progressing."
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus attackers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 at the time to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video posted on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, criticized the allegations as "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," said the five-time Golden Ball winner in the camera.
“They want to be promoted using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations they called “unacceptable reporting of privacy concerns,” Reuters reported.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the severity of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that “99 percent” was a “good guy” who was let down by that “one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual intercourse, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed of her injuries at the hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and worried that she would be “publicly humiliated”.
The 34-year-old says she now wants to cancel the settlement because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of moving to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve as part of a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million transfer.
Brexit: UK will “repent forever” for losing automakers
The UK will "repent forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of waiting at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My position is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, we will experience production disruptions at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal over the possible consequences for the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The carmaker’s main concern is the risks in the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border break that industry says could lead to delays and a shortage of parts.
Toyota would not be able to hold more supplies at its Derbyshire plant than needed for one day, the company said, and production would be halted.
Mr Clark said the Chequers plan offered by Theresa May for future relations with the EU was "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need to agree. We want to reach the best possible agreement that will allow, as I say, not only to maintain the current success, but also to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's program today.
“Evidence from not only Toyota but also other manufacturers shows that we absolutely need to be able to continue this very successful supply chain.”
Toyota could not say how long production could be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked for 24 years in Burnaston and is a member of the Unite trade union, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have come up with a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus endanger Mueller’s independence, has been fueling gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a wire to record talks with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected these statements.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amid announcements that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date has not been set, it could be this week; and it could be postponed for another week taking into account everything else that is going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to report everything to the press."
Some journalists would dispute this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not the result of a reluctance to the "theater behavior" of television reporters, although she said: "I will not oppose the fact that they're messing around."
She then hinted that direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president is organizing more meetings to answer questions than any president before him," she said, adding without providing evidence: "We have analyzed the numbers."
Short speeches will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask a question to the president of the United States, it’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to make that happen often, and you may have seen it in the last few weeks, and it is that you can talk to the President of the United States that will replace short speeches to the press.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Independent press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why, a free and sometimes bizarre performance in front of assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers employed by the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland because of fears of Brexit
The health minister sent a letter to EU staff working at the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and desire to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of applying for residence status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on a withdrawal have resumed, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and help patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers line-up player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, reports Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before half-time.
“He came to the field line and just crashed,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the edge of the field before putting him on stretchers and sending him for further tests.
A Tennessee State University spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there were no "details about the type/scope of the injury" and that the Tennessee State was trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a third-year student with two years of playing experience, plays his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he had a total of five knockouts before leaving the game, reaching a total of 18 knockouts in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the United Kingdom
According to the new Conservative plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s bid to attract young voters.
The increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will be charged a higher fee when buying real estate in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing solutions and focus on those with high wages.
The tax increases will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and additional money will contribute to the government’s efforts to combat homelessness.
The additional fee <0xCC><0xB6> added to the current fee, including the increase introduced two years ago on other homes and real estate purchased for issue <0xCC><0xB6> may be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built real estate in London is bought by residents who are not resident in the UK, which increases prices and makes it difficult for buyers who buy the first real estate to get involved in the company of those who have their own home.
Many rich areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help more young people get to their first home.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by taking but not exploiting the land, and urged Mrs May to drop quotas on affordable properties to repair “the embarrassment of the housing situation” in Britain.
Corbyn has announced proposals for a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to unintended evictions.
He also wants to give councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my mandate to renewing the British dream that every new generation should have a better life.
And that means repairing our failed housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be right that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes easily as well as valuable Britons.
The dream of owning a home has gone too far for a lot of people, and the shame of homelessness is still very real."
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to one day become Scotland's governor.
Scotland, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the Premier League, with three points less than the tops.
This summer, he moved to Stadium of Lights after again leading St. Mirren at the Scottish Football Championship last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told BBC Scotland.
But I grew up looking at Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and it always pulled me back.
But that opportunity could only be realised if I was successful in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paul Di Cani.
Former Alloa Athletica boss says he didn’t feel fear because he inherited such famous names at such a big club after previously refusing calls to Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at this point will be measured by whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and content, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I’d probably consider myself successful only if I could take the club there again.”
Ross only reached the third year of his managerial career, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and 15 months of experience as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloi recover from falling into the third category and took St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the champions of the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” recalled the takeover of Aloe.
“I really believed that managing is what suits me more than playing.
It sounds unusual because I was doing well, earning solid income and enjoying pretty successful moments.
But the game can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I'm still going through it in terms of stress and work pressure, but management seems like the right thing to do.
I’ve always wanted to manage, and now I’m doing it. I feel more comfortable in my own skin than I’ve ever felt in my life.”

The perfect time for a pint is at 17:30 on Saturday, according to research
The summer heat wave has increased revenues for British pubs struggling with finances, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows that pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in revenue in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, from the business consultancy of the Office of the Chief Book Controller, who collected the data, said: “The continuation of the good weather and England’s participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July would be similar to the previous month in June, when the revenues of the pubs increased by 2.8 percent, with the restaurant being even more so now.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars where drinks are mostly served have achieved much greater gains on equal terms than the losses suffered by restaurants.
Pubs where food is mostly served have also been killed by the heat, though not as dramatic as restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In managed pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s Recreation and Hospitality Analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to sales on the foreign market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle with difficulties, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to constant cost pressures.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened the fear of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children, some of whom are just 11 years old, open secret accounts on social networks that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of "fake Insta" accounts <0xCC><0xB6> a reference to a photo-sharing site.
The news has heightened fears of publishing sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they used a cleaned-up "main" account to show their parents while also having private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret website of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others with the words “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools, found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to owning private accounts.
HMC’s chief executive, Mike Buchanan, said: “It’s worrying that many teenagers are trying to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘voice of athlete’ on Scottish Athletic Board
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletic Board as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated athlete, and President Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to capitalize on her broad international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by making her a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I want to be the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute to the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games out of his four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, was unable to walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was exhausting, but he recovered completely, he learned to walk again today for the purpose of agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouragement!"
Shared opinions on the Internet about an ad for a traitor who compares mothers to cows
A company producing traitors with its advertising that compares mothers who breastfeed their children to cows who are aroused by the muse has shared opinions on the Internet.
To mark the launch of a product claimed to be “the world’s first silent wearable publisher,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by an ironic music video to show the freedom the new publisher gives mothers.
Four mothers dance in a barn full of hay and cows with music that reads: “Yes, I can do it myself, but you can’t see any tail” and “In case you haven’t noticed, this isn’t a udder, it’s my breasts.”
Then there is the chorus: “Pump out, pump out, with it I feed the baby, pump out, pump out, I muse my ladies.”
However, the advertisement, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the “horrors” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their children are stolen a few days after birth,” one person wrote.
Traitor Elvie discreetly fits into breastfed bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person comments: “Understandably traumatic for mother and child.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise traitors to mothers who will be able to keep their babies?"
Someone added, "Completely mindless advertising."
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that her song was "ridiculous".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I were still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The milk release made me feel just like a cow.
It's kind of crazy, but I've seen it the way it is.
“It’s a great product,” she said.
Another person commented: “This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who give out milk (often in their workplaces or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were all dancing with discrete traitors placed in bras.
The concept of the campaign is based on the knowledge that many milk-producing women say they feel like a cow.
Traitor Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or pipes, and discreetly fits into a breastfeeding bra, allowing women to move freely, hold their babies, and even go out during the betrayal.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and executive creative director, commented: “Elvie is such a revolutionary product that she deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the depiction of women and cows, we wanted to put betrayal and all its challenges in the spotlight, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new traitor will bring.
This isn't the first time that a traitor named Elvie has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Transferred to Tent Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the heavy rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children under sponsorship.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors were undocumented immigrants themselves and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by stepping out and taking responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously recorded in criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household in the country are illegal, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
Therefore, we continue to search for these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to shelter workers, in order to speed up the procedure for children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than after 60 days, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via a videoconferencing call, not in person, to bring their case for legal status before the immigration court.
Those who do not meet the criteria will be deported quickly.
According to shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escape.
Proponents said these concerns were expressed in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where, due to its size, it is very likely that signs that the child is struggling will be overlooked.
They added that moving children to a tent city without enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to immediately withdraw
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, while millions have been left homeless.
He said Damascus would continue "fighting in this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleared" of terrorist groups and "any illegal alien presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in a war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were met and blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees not to return.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to resume political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a massive attack by Syrian forces with Russian backing on a province of three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be aimed at jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, "who will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "revision of articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, the impeachment and scandal end his presidency prematurely.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
There are currently no signs of spectator fatigue.
Since 2014, audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on strike, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” surpassed audiences with as many as 3.5 million viewers on mainstream news nights.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” about the secretary of government who becomes president after the Capitol-destroying attack.
Nell Scovell, author of the comedy Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, "Because he makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell said.
There's a lot of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington could determine the future of the abortion law stemming from the Roe v. Wade trial, whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Yet, you exceed the level of an informed citizen when you catch yourself watching a group of experts for six hours discussing how Bob Woodward used “deep background” sources for his book Fear, about Mr. Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“a garment full of arrogance,” writes the Washington Post and the Trump Post).
I, for example, will never look at Super Maria with the same eyes again.
“Part of what makes him feel like a reality show is that he feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawnshop, about the rotating cast and everyday plots of the Trump show.
You can't afford to miss a single episode because you're going to be lagging behind.
When I reached Mr. Fleiss this week, in front of his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, it was sunny with a temperature of 80 degrees (about 27 °C), but he was inside watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t separate himself from the TV, not while Brett Kavanaugh was face to face with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hung over.
“I remember doing all these crazy shows in the past and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Money from the outside to the left in the most uncertain mid-term election race for Congress
Not surprisingly, the 17th District of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that resulted in two candidates running for the same spot.
This recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh highlights Democrat Conor Lamb, who won a seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
Lamb competes against another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement triggered a campaign funding battle between the main party fundraisers, the Democratic Campaign Fundraising Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Congressional Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely followed special March elections for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
This position was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political analysts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
U.S. to punish El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraw
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to summon U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the Department of State.
But the penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and high unemployment and homicide rates.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to resume a similar gathering last year, which was seen as progress in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
However, by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending any consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
Vice President Mike Pence should address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further heavy messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman on behalf of Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, who also wanted to remain anonymous.
History
The next step could be a report by Special Investigator Robert Mueller on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is now very substantial publicly available evidence.
Mr Mueller also reportedly focused his investigation on whether Mr Trump’s campaign was secretly negotiated with Russia as part of its attack on our election.
If the majority in Congress changes, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to speak again to voters, and perhaps ultimately to a jury of his peers.
There are many “ifs” and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trum is inevitable - nor of those like him in Europe.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, only that the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
History revolves around such points of inflection, and the relentless march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these points of inflection.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the newspaper reported last year that he secretly suggested filming the president and speculated on his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently commissioned investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it has been upheld by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?”
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term congressional elections that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will sleep a long winter's sleep.
But I believe that we will not fall because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that used to sit in my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, sent me to light a sabbath candle on that table with a crucifix.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the return of Rapid from Vienna.
The Rangers hosted Rapid from Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarrel earlier this month, would put them in a strong position to qualify for the Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in a 2'2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for bigger things.
“It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opponent,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game believing that we could achieve something and we got a point.
We may have been able to steal the game in the end, but overall, the unsolved result is probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second.
Thursday is another big European night.
Let's hope we can win three points, but it will be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but with the support of the fans, I am sure that we can attack and achieve a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough year, between what happened to my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there’s some good feeling.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
Let’s hope we can continue, leave last season behind and be successful.”
Women can't sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the study participants had a clear idea of what kind of care they wanted, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the respondents to the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to start a conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Engage your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out a way to pay these costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value that will help you cover those costs, or self-insurance with your own wealth as long as you have the money.
Arrange your legal documents: Prevent legal battles at the root.
Hire health care representatives to identify a reliable person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your wishes in case you can’t communicate.
Also, consider giving power of attorney to manage your finances.
You want to choose a reliable person to make financial decisions on your behalf and secure the payment of your bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your aging parent is in a situation that requires urgent medical intervention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Provide details in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
“Keep that plan on hand.”
Man shot multiple times by air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot by an air rifle as he returned home after a night out.
The victim, in her forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arms.
Police described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
As communications were interrupted, aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the province of Donggale, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a county that stretches along more than 300 km of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstone of the economy of Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mostly concentrated in Moraweli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Fire Circle and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree tsunami struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake hits the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released on Saturday by an Alaska state police officer.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is being held in custody by Mat-Su and is being held on an uninsured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent, of course," when asked about his pleadings.
Palina is charged with three class A offences, which means he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which are punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reports of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD after his service in Iraq.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the earthquake that struck Indonesia's Sulawesi island on Friday.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake hit the immediate vicinity of central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death sentence for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been carried out in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a truck to rent a Home Depot store to attack a bike lane along the West Side road in Lower Manhattan, where he mowed down pedestrians and cyclists on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight victims and "deliberately" inflicted severe bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, which was filed in the southern district of New York.
Both of these points lead to a possible death penalty, according to a court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov’s federal grand jury struck with a 22-point indictment that included eight murder and extortion charges, which federal prosecutors typically use in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted injuries, damage and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Feruchi, Herna Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Dajandro.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York City in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953, in an electric chair.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed a lack of remorse in the days and months after the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that after watching a video of ISIS on his phone, he was inspired to carry out the attack, according to the indictment.
He also asked for the flag of ISIS to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting an admission of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army” during a Conservatives’ conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative lawmaker Peter Bone told a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "exited" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is underscored by Tories prone to remain who join a special anti-Brexit protest in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain her Chequers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexiteers, Brexiteers and the EU.
The Allies insisted that she would continue trying to conclude an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bone said at a campaign rally in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr Farage should have won the title and be responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we have to kick out the Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be subordinate.
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bone dismissed the allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely inaccurate.”
Conservative and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also in the procession, addressing reporters with the words: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular in our party and among our activists who were actually the ones who took to the streets and elected us.
Please drop Chequers and start listening."
In a prominent message to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers retain their jobs when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the crowd that politicians must be forced to "feel pressure" if they are to fail in a 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them ‘you’re not going to get away with it.’”
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remainder marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Crowds of activists waved banners "Toryians against Brexit" after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they suffered with the party's application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can have IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus Plus plan, for a smooth border situation, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Seriously Consider’ Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "seriously consider running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a face-to-face meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been at the center of speculation for some time now that it could stand up to Trump in 2020.
The meeting on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with citizens since Trump took office.
He asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that meant a woman at the head.
Arrest for the murder of LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in a shooting with the death of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims that occurred on Friday.
Baton Rouge police released information about the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), at 11 a.m., at an ET press conference.
On Friday, they released a video of the murder, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was killed early on Friday near the campus of Southern University.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being at the crime scene and possessing a weapon and killing Wayd Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by East Baton Rouge County Police.
Sims, a 3rd-year, 198 cm tall student who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games in last season's top 10 for an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion after the order ensures his victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team's order would "play a major role in the race".
From the starting position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton behind while defending his position in the first two laps and calling on Vettel to attack a member of his team.
Vettel first went into boxing and left Hamilton to get into circulation at the start, something that was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes entered the pit one lap later and exited behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved forward after a wheel-on-wheel action that left the Ferrari driver reluctant to leave the free interior in danger of lagging behind after a double move in defence of the third curve.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race as he relied on his tires to reach a quick finish and overtook Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally reached boxing in the 44th round, but failed to accelerate his pace in the remaining eight laps while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he's a real gentleman for letting me pass.
The team has done a really great job to achieve the formation finish,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Addressing a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “evil and nasty and dishonest.”
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean, nasty and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at publishing and leaking information to the public, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leave any information?
Remember her answer...did you release the document to the public – ‘aaa, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't.'
Wait a minute.
Did we let go... No, we didn’t,” he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Senator Feinstein in July detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, and it leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t make her story public,” Feinstein told the board.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret, which she asked for.”
However, her denial did not meet the approval of the president, who commented at the meeting on Saturday night: “Let me tell you something – it was a very bad body language.
Maybe not, but I've never seen a worse body language in my life."
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to restore power at all costs.
You see the evil, the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5 <0xCC><0xB6> 3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for their loss to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by winning Dundee on Saturday with a score of 5'3.
In the early minutes, the Giants came up with the advantage of two naked shots by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the home team to a tie, and then Dwyer brought the Giants back to the lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's Elite League team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2'1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute, at 3:35 a.m., with Kendall McFaull's assistance, with David Rutherford's assistance to double the lead by scoring Beauvillier four minutes later.
In the game's hectic opening, Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10 minutes before Matt Marquardt allowed Cownie to equalize at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants finished the first third with a lead when he scored his second goal that night at the end of the first third.
The locals regrouped and Bouchard once again led them to a tie in the 27:37 draw.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen for Dundee's first lead at the end of the second third, and he made sure to win when his team was already halfway through winning the final third of the match for the fifth time.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are hosting the Milton Keynes team in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to ensure hundreds of passengers on plane avoid earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller was declared a hero after he died while ensuring the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many were reported missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area, with many trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower, which was rocking heavily.
He remained to ensure the safe take-off of the Batik Air aircraft on flight 6321, which was then on the runway.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our heart breaks because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the state disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggali, Sigui and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll continues to rise, as many bodies are still under rubble and many could not be reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves that reached heights of up to six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency vehicles are bringing in bodies every minute.
The government is running out of clean water.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse."
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” reports CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok earlier this year, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which owns the plane that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now claims one man is missing, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that sank.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to track one of the passengers since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane fell into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
What caused the fall and the exact sequence of events remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some eyewitnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger from America, said the plane was flying very low.
"That's very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others were able to break through the water that reached their waist to the exit in case of an aircraft sinking.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby to repair the dock also helped rescue using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have been killed in accidents involving air carriers registered with PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included Air Niugini.
An Analyst Exhibits a Timeline of the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
On Saturday, prosecutors completed a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
The jury described how he used cell phone data to piece together a puzzle about the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got the location data from several phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was in the same location as Chambersin at the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records indicate that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis, some time after Chambers' death, deleted her messages, calls and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be sent to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to provoke a negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol-based singer-songwriter The High Breed claims hip-hop music has drifted away from its origins filled with political messages and a look at societal issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common are reborn in the UK through artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues couple over dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York City nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother calling her “another black woman.”
The couple denies being racist, comparing the accusation to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned on her first day of work in 2016 that her children's new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was a black woman.
“NOT ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN,” Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After realizing her mistake, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman found herself in an “inconvenient” situation and fired Ms. Maurice, she claims, because their then-former nanny, who was African-American, was doing a poor job and was expecting a Filipina instead.
Mrs. Maurice got a paycheck for one day of work, and then she went home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for dismissal fees and seeking $350 a day in damages for the six-month period for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that I can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they were racists, saying that ending Maurice's employment was reasonable to do, out of fear that the insult would later make them unable to trust her.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her in the message.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to the person you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your baby?
Come on."
Plasco said his wife had only received two months of maternity leave after giving birth and was in a "very difficult situation".
“You’re going to sue someone who’s in a situation like this.
"That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with the talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, says in the letter: “It is difficult to put yourself in the skin of someone who will read the book for the first time before it is published.
It’s very fun what we know now about Paddington’s huge success.”
Saying that her father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a little teddy bear to write a children's book, would have been optimistic if his work had been rejected, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was filled with happiness and sadness after his death last year.
About Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of the family," she added that her father was silently proud of his final success.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn’t a boaster,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, everything felt like an achievement of your own child: you are proud of him even though none of it is really your doing.
I think Paddington's success was seen that way.
"Although it was his work and his imagination, he was always credited exclusively to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and we had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad has called regularly to say it's really bad and to believe it won't get away," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
Which I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you so much.
I'll join you soon.
I'll join you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to maintain her heart rate slowly lost their effect and left her body system.
She died shortly before boarding, and then it all went out.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing what was going to happen.
I couldn't scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to keep everything in me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was already in mourning over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - who were unaware of the temptations she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I lowered my head, and tears were pouring down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt a strong sense of compassion for Hope.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Messages from women in mourning on a bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have been left without loved ones for suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parents to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a chef with an infectious smile that awaited a brilliant career.
“Everyone remembers him for his smile.
They always said that his smile could fill every room with joy.”
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was in a “really dark state.”
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was then 11 years old, found his brother after he took his own life.
Mrs Davis said: “I’m constantly worried that it will have a negative effect.”
Mrs. Davis came up with the idea with cards “so that people would know that there is someone you can go to and talk to, even if he is a friend.
“Don’t sit in silence, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt sad, depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas, he was at the very bottom when the children opened the presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or want anything else.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they must overcome it: “All this leaves a great cavity in the family.
He's kidnapping us.
We will continue to fight and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought maybe we could bring a little unity if we really managed to get something like what he asked for in a time-limited and extensive investigation," Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "breaking up" in the midst of a rooted party blockade.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is prompted by the choice of the moment.
The midterm elections are coming in just five weeks, November 6th, if Republicans are not expected to do well, then they will be seriously weakened in attempts to lead the desired man to the election for the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly calls on the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI draws up its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to break through with a decisive vote and confirm his seat on the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors 'falling' under Kim
The number of defectors from North to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the United Southern Alliance ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the key factors are tighter controls at the border crossing between North Korea and China and higher taxes that smugglers charge people.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
The vast majority of North Koreans eventually acquired South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often violently returns them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on stalled denuclearization talks.
This came after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to free the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for not making any progress since then.
“Without any trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and it does not come into consideration that under such circumstances we are the first to disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical,” says he is incompetent to serve on Supreme Court
Opposition leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that a woman, if she had ever behaved like that, would be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During the opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and suffocating as he discussed his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and coordinated denigration” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not participate in the Supreme Court because he showed prejudice against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he attacks Mrs. Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi withdrew.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not capable of not only being in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law stemming from Roe's lawsuit against Wade, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions about whether to overturn some Supreme Court rulings.
"It's not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't that wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
Women have to deal with it.
Justified criticism, anger that has accumulated for months and years <0xCC><0xB6> all this can not be rid of without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. What do you think?"
She continued: “I was greatly helped by a woman who used to be an executive who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to: ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry.'"
And then she went on.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs, in an office dominated by men, is how, one time when I was crying out of indescribable anger, an elderly woman, a cold manager who I was always a little afraid, dragged me down the stairs.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, so they'll be happy because they'll think they hit you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard the Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, concluded that there was no reason not to consider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and they certainly didn’t need another one.
Someone called them “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had already been pushed back, it was lagging behind in raising funds, and vowed not to enter the race if it did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of the supporters, who gave the men $1,000 each, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I have a discount?” she asked.
While she was saying she wasn't going to run a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotion of gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and target voters instead of delegates, and the anger at sexism that shook her throat.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms Schroeder recalled the media's reaction to her.
"You'd think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor."
I remember thinking about what they would put on my tombstone.
"She cried."
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The start of the U.S.-China trade war has resonated loudly, and while the battle is far from over, a rift between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, issued a first warning earlier this year, taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, in fact taxing half of all goods coming to the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated in some way each time, and recently it has imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has vowed to retaliate with a blow to the United States, and the world’s second-largest economy will certainly not surrender soon.
Washington’s withdrawal could be achieved by yielding to demands, but public submission to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions to trigger an economic downturn in both countries is actually much more dangerous than observers believed,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate for strategic thinking who focused on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorist attacks in order to establish a normal situation.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily life and existence have now been met.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime could use help rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The Europe team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 <0xCC><0xB6> 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown as the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for almost the entire tournament, on the 16th hole pair 3, sent the ball into the water on the first blow, leaving the match to Francesca Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was brilliant in all rounds and became one of four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the tournament began in 1979.
Jordan Spieth was kicked out of Denmark by Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen, Europe's lowest-ranked player, with a 5&4.
The best player in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the European with the most wins in the tournament with 25,5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop the tears.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win the cup again.
It's all about the team. I'm happy to be able to help," said Garcia, full of emotions after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated legendary American golfer Tiger Woods in individual games on Sunday, scoring 2&1.
“I’m incredibly proud to have won over Tiger Woods; I grew up watching him play,” Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
An unusual statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, and is located just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a way out, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
After a disappointing performance by his team, Captain Jim Furyk said, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought."
At some point, we resisted Europe.
We didn't make it.
I'm taking my hat off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna get over it, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're gonna move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
