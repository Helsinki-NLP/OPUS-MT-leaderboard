You never know what will happen tomorrow.
Thanks for the email!
Choose one.
You'll be completely safe.
I turned around.
Stay there.

A man has many desires that he actually does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it had been fulfilled, the man would have become completely sick of lifelessly desire.
