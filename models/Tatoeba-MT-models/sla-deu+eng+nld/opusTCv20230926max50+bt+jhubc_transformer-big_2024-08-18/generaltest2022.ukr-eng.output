In Kherson, people again went to a rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told to the agency participants of the event, the Khersons had time to hold a rally before the military of the Russian Federation arrived on the scene for dispersal with equipment.
"We managed to hold a rally. Now there arrived the equipment of the Russian Federation," - said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered at the protest on Svobody Square - near the building of the Regional State Administration and the regional council.
This area, like the building, is currently controlled by armed Russian troops who use weapons against rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk region regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, they are wounded and detained.
Russian invaders also kidnap residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title of "Hero City".
On February 24, Russian President Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers and ballistic missiles.

Zelensky: Mariupol is the heart of war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelensky believes that the fighting for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces of Ukraine are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights – we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) – people who have drawn on themselves a large number of the enemy.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the OOS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer to us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our results, in our victory...”
Details: Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution, if they will be in our country."
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to end.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied by any peace under any conditions.
But if we speak not emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end in millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, all comes to the end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight – but for the sake of life.
You cannot fight for the dust when there is nothing, no people.”

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows us to analyze the postmodern context as one where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of war crimes in Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 soldiers of a separate motorized rifle brigade directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha," the report says.
The Ministry of Interior noted that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine all war criminals will be tried and brought to justice.
You can view the list by following the link.
According to Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
Mass killings of civilians by the Russian military have been recorded in the liberated towns and villages.
On April 1, the mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, reported that 280 people were buried in fraternal graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of the Kiev region liberated from the Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders shell and destroy key infrastructure facilities, carry out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket launchers, ballistic missiles, air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
Bulob is great, I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal bullying of the civilian population north of Kyiv.
Photos of tortured and shot people confused the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But nothing surprised me at all. It happens exactly what I was sadly waiting for...
I took out the children and elderly parents from Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces of Ukraine and for no moment doubted that in case of occupation, the suburbs of Kiev will not spare my family.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given to remove a copy of the shooting case of his great-grandfather: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to be executed is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, poor "one-man" nobility, never went to serfs.
The fact that they lived on farms and had several cows was enough to condemn the baker and feeder of young children to execution.
My parents didn’t even know where the grave was.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case there is the name of the knocker Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I would not be surprised if it was his relative who was a KGBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far away, as you know, falls...
The shooting trio, which condemned the execution of the peasants, were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of his great-grandfather, he became interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources such as the "Immortal barracks", which qualitatively remind of the events of those years.
So, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of the killers – the system first discredited and then destroyed.
As if on a computer were found files with child pornography, for it was put in prison, and there quickly died.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
Why are you surprised at what they are doing now?
There are concentrated the most vile features of human nature.
Slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th and 19th centuries overlaid on the thousand-year-old Ordinian tradition.
And then over what turned out, they did a beastly genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligentsia during several waves of red terror.
Watch the 1992 semi-French film Chekist, that’s how it was.
You've seen my photos in the swimsuit.
Can you ask my wife what I can buy from a cough .
I'm sorry, I don't have anyone to ask.
I still wanted to ask you maybe you know where the kids went, because Galya can't know them.
Lyubosh, Igor asks if it is convenient for you to go tomorrow? (it is a weekend and can go, because the car has not been seen at the station today).
We are very uncomfortable to bother you so much.
You are very helpful, thank you!!

We talked about children with special needs you and the system of their education in Ukraine.
When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as an employee of Fpoint, the first question was how they found the dog, how they found the pug.
Everyone is following the page on Facebook.
We were asked to convey our congratulations and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news.
We also talked about people of Roma nationality who have privileges in Ukraine.
And we agreed that if the child comes and the parents do not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them in the phone mode.

Yes, we took home and took my aunt immediately.
She was very grateful, she was crying.
I told her about you and how you help Ukrainians.
Tears were in her eyes.
She said if it was possible there might still be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm very grateful to you, too.
I always felt sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.

As reported by "European Pravda", this writes Welt with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the German Ministry of Economy on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
Also offered howitzers in the variant on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in combat have to pick up relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
According to the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kiev with 100 howitzers in the shortest possible time, and the gaps formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, that is, before the second half of 2024.
Full deliveries will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?
Thank you, we will find how to fill rachunoe and naberkmo. I will write you back. Thank you

Can you tell me how to get to the city center?
I will share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their family or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are there.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

How do you feel today? <0xC5><0x9B>wi<0xC4><0x99>cim<0xC5><0x85> after the celebration?
Hi, I'm sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly.
Sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that Kolya and I had a bad time translating the test yesterday.
I will ask either Grigory Denisenko or Jonashek)) to help me with mathematical concepts at least a little.
Maybe I can be of some use to them?
If it is possible, I want to tighten the mathematical terms for the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with Kolya so that it is without errors.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We are very much hoping for that too.
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to her Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian woman - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn’t stay away.
We agreed that we would be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because this is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
Branch in Hall No29 is designed specifically for filing and processing applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a spare card
Don't worry, I'm just a man.
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I didn't go. Yes, I did. I can do that! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you leaving the city for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we honored the 80th anniversary of the mass shooting of Ukrainian Jews by German soldiers in Babin Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, among whom was the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must defend this foundation – it is also part of our responsibility to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and letting them die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babyn Yar.
For more than a month, the Germans see it in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany is imposing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which was not so long ago impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of heavy weapons necessary for Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and sacrifices to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be collected

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
Nine years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the war in Donbas, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, grew.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine’s support for NATO’s accession and NATO’s help in the face of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries – for the untimely supply of weapons, the refusal to close the skies, the reluctance to “harass” Russia.
In addition, there is a high risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon the desire for membership in the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how exactly the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of NATO membership is closer than ever in history, and why the security guarantees that can be discussed at the re-enactment
What do you think is here
I have a volt partner that indicates that my statement is under consideration.

Denise was in a good mood today.
I made an agreement with a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school, so that he would show him everything.

Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to talk to him, and I felt sorry for him.
I’ve been mentally supportive of him for almost a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
At the same time, I started having problems at work.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe we really need to look at him differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
God has decided our own destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He speaks only Czech.

I don't remember this schedule.
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say “have not done this before”
Direct speech of Konashenkov: "We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike decision-making centers, including in Kiev, which the Russian army previously refrained from doing.”
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remains of Russian missiles shot down by the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital's Poznyaks.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a high-rise building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit the TV tower in Dorogozhychi near Babyn Yar, killing 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles over the Southern Railway Station, flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building.
March 14, the wreckage of a downed missile of the invaders broke the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential complex on Vinogradar, killing one person and wounding 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles completely destroyed the modern Retroville shopping center on Vinogradar, killing at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, are still early to return.
The military explained to local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are a lot of mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the brutality of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly due to an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that a “Ukrainian projectile” had fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing into a cold sweat from the very idea that NATO fighter jets will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky speaks not so much to them as to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of Europe’s largest cities, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this subtle fusion of strength, touch, and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Whether Paris or Brussels opposes the acceleration of Ukraine’s accession, but this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.

I have a lot to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You are planning to buy this dress that you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t accept that.
He's vying for the old reality.
You call for work, find out whether to go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the children at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it's not for long.
Now .... agree ... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket, everything we spent at home.
Many of our managers, on our work did not give wages.
Where should I go ?? Who needs me ? How should I provide for children ? Where should I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you've got to drive 1,000 miles.
You don't know what you're going to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next? I don't know. How much is it? I don't know. Children ask for sweets. And you can't . It's dear to you.
And from every iron - we do not have this.
We have the choice to stay there and put the children in danger, or try to escape here.

These are small entrepreneurs who opened volunteer headquarters in their premises and shops.
These are tractors who actually go into the field under fire, because it is time to sow.
These are bus drivers who agree today to go in rubber convoys to the temporarily occupied territories to take help there and pick up people from there.
These are heroic guides who go to the combat zone without fear, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peace stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are tankers who stood on the Zhytomyr highway in the early days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities, which under fire take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in their spare time they still volunteer, collecting first aid kits to the front.

My daughter is 8 years old, is this age acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports for a visa to Canada.
There are a lot of people in the visa center in Warsaw and they do not work on-line.
I wanted to come for a day, but it's a long way, it takes a long time to travel by train, the child will have a hard time.
So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, everything suits us.

Until then - put stamps like this and then equated these stamps to visas
The Overseas Electoral Commission of Ukraine (ZVO of Ukraine) is a constituency that unites election precincts located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of voting premises in embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises at military bases abroad,[note 1] which are the Ukrainian peacekeeping contingents (Kosovo and DR Congo).
In the Foreign Electoral District, only nationwide votes are held: elections of the President and People's Deputies and all-Ukrainian referendums.
Local elections are not held in ZVO.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is it?
The head of the Office of the President Andriy Yermak said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” on weapons handed over to us by the Allies.
Yermak’s direct speech: “They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness, and they are trying to “shut down” the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the latest fakes is the destruction of the S-300 air defense system transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are about to surrender with weapons from the Allies, and it is massively transferred to the armament of the Russian army.
I want to warn such fakes right away.
Because weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine exclusively sends the enemy to the other world.
I'm sorry, forgot to ask how much a boule cost a gardener in the month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage at the evidence that Russian forces have committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow has rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and severely wounded by Russian troops are deserving of condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a “violation of international law.”
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in a suburb of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depicted the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tightening sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the perpetrators.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian coal and oil exports.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusations as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO had “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, does not raise any doubts about who “ordered” this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another stage of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
Russia’s Investigative Committee on April 4 issued a statement announcing an “investigation” on charges of Ukraine spreading “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3 accusing Russian troops of committing a “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out,” Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for shots in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said about the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kyiv.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian service of Radio Liberty on April 2 saw the bodies of civilians on the streets of a small city.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in various places in Bucha.
The bodies of one group of nine people — all civilian — were scattered on the ground near a site that local residents said was being used by Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In total, Ukrainian authorities said the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kiev is gone." How invaders vilely exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, torture.
In this list there is another item, about which there is currently much less information – the removal of the local population to the enemy territory.
Since about mid-March, Russian invaders have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from the temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually given to the Russian military training ground.
Ukrainska Pravda found the Ukrainians and their relatives who had been taken out to ask how the same “evacuation” was taking place and whether there were ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from hopelessness.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with their relatives.
However, given the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were taken to Russia and Belarus under severe coercion.
So in Melitopol, the Russians kidnapped the staff of the second maternity hospital, took away from there children without parents, including 12-year-old Myroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine in swimming, Yosyp Zakhepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina pre-assembled the alarming suitcases, but in the morning of February 24 did not have time to evacuate.
They did not have their own car, and suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 o'clock in the afternoon on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
At 6 p.m. on February 24, people who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian entered the entrance.
They ask, “Is there anyone?” – I say yes. – “Come out!”.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, “We have come to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov.”
It was a Chechen OMON, not even troops, young guys 25-35 years old.
They said: “The Ukrainians helped us in the war, Sashko Bily (commanded a detachment of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO Viking, which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war – UP), now we have come to help you.”
On the third day, they asked us what we lacked.
We say that water, with it was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "the Russians will take it anyway" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also a video on the Internet where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So they brought the sausage after the looting of the store and say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to give up our phones,” they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can't do anything because our families are there."
And mostly they did not fight, but went to rob shops, marauding.
They brought a chicken, one tied a St. George ribbon to one leg, and the other - their white scotch and called it "the militia".
They arrived in Ukraine unprepared.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have any artillery?"
What’s more, we had joined forces – the Chechens didn’t know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to find out whether it was their own or someone else’s.
They were in our house until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, followed by the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 pieces of equipment between the houses – our constantly fell into it from the Bayraktars.
But they came and told us that the Armed Forces of Ukraine no longer exist, but there is “Azov”, and, according to them, “Azov” so thousands of 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been promoted since the beginning of March.
Once a Russian – either an airborne officer or an FSB representative – came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – it was about Butcha, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a “green corridor”.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "Then feel sorry for the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either Grads or mortars.
And then it flew back... Neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
In our house there was a direct hit to the third floor.
Later, they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand us over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
Some did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - they said, "you will be shot there, you will be sold to the authorities."
We were transported through Chernobyl, there were fires on both sides of the road, equipment was broken, although the Belarusians said that the Russians immediately took the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint of the Komar we passed improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, gave tea.
And here we hear shots! Shooting rocket, and you can see the trace – it worked "Iskander" in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, it's the planes that fly, turn around at the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were immersed in a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonky" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasily Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am, I am from Chernihiv.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are captured.
The poor people are suffering.
Lukashenka is so good!
As he says, so it will be.”
They offered to give interviews to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN (at least so they were called) spread misinformation that men are not allowed to go to Poland.
Many believed this and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – my daughter did not have a passport.
We were supposed to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us with anything, and in Minsk at the train station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
Here I will say that we were greatly helped by Belarusian volunteers.
We were sent to Minsk and escorted.
The sanatorium was not held by force.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who volunteered to take us to Warsaw.
Passing near Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the missile first flies, beautifully glows, and then goes out.
People who got on a bus in Mozyr said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the ranges.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he was summoned.
However, the northern part of Belarus, there de Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You're lying, we're a peaceful people."
They do not accept that their ranges are used for shelling Ukraine.
We had friends in Poland who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, we decide what we will do next.
There are probably as many Ukrainian flags in Estonia as there are Estonian flags.”
Marina lived on the territory of the military town in Gostomel with the family of his brother – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to spend the night in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.

On April 1, the Mayor of Bucha, Anatoliy Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from the Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the invaders were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in Bucha alone, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some tied their hands and shot in the back of the head, some of those killed were minors.
Killed and with traces of torture found the village mayor Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in the mass grave, Igor – in the sewer.
On either side of the highway 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several undressed women wrapped in a blanket were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
And if I go, no one will be home.
I ordered a parcel from Germany using DHL.
Yesterday I was supposed to have it delivered to me, but no one contacted me and the parcel was not delivered, and on the DHL website it is said that the recipient could not be found.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European Truth".
“All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment it is done late.
So what if, for example, we talk about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries, I see 100% support, it is true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
When asked if Ukraine had received enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied, “No, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would have a different look.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulder of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war," he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of Great Britain promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

He was a very rich man, after a while he called and reported that he had had heart surgery.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and thought maybe I was his toy and maybe I needed his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard, a crocodile-like car, and it let go of the hail.

“I tell her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio’ has been delayed because of the imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to stutter extra when calling.”
"For a whole month we hide from our mother-in-law information about the war.
So far, it's working.
However, Spots (cat – UP) on the pus and hind legs licked fur – it can be from stress, change of feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her for a month "incognito".
And on April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova for the first time in her life took up arms.
"For 33 days, I lived as a partisan with her in an apartment.
The war was also hidden from her, and the fact that I was nearby – formally came, as always, for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.
The radio was always at the bedside.
The mother-in-law spends most of her time in her room.
She hears bad – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her "walkers," I hid in my room.
First of all, I hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who talked to her. That's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but the war.
I will ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
It is April 17 - I have cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it :)
Hello, if tomorrow we need more help we can come

The British, who in the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine defended Mariupol, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The British soldier, who is a member of the Marine Corps brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would lay down their arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: twitter-page of Aydin Eislin, a British man who has served in the ranks of the Armed Forces since 2018, the Air Force with reference to members of the family and friends of Eislin, Atlas News with reference to the words of a friend of Eislin, who spoke with him
“We have received a message from him: ‘It’s been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to Russian troops.
We had no food and no ammunition.
Thank you all, I hope the war ends soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which participates in the defense operation of Mariupol.
Journalists of the Air Force contacted the mother of the soldier Ann Wood, and she confirmed that by phone her son reported that they plan to surrender.
A friend of the military's Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in a recent phone call, Eislin had told about the plans of their surrender unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists of Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that Eislin’s unit intends to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall without weapons and bullets into the hands of the so-called “Kadyrovtsi” units.
Also in social networks were distributed audio recording of a phone conversation, in which allegedly Aislin speaks with his friend American, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British said that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company “Wagner”.
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to participate in the fight against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic state" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and was sworn in.
Aislin's friends and relatives called Johnny, and in social networks he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.
Please, I know it's hard for you, but I'd like to know whether we're together or not.

Bolshevist attackers for their losses in battle played to the full.
They shot the teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unknown relative, the young man Boris Oleksiyenko.
Their bodies were thrown into “a deep washing pit that was covered with earth.”

Occasionally, one of the residents ran through the fire from house to house.
The bodies of the tortured Bolsheviks were always found on the streets

I am not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go like this for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which has the title "On the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the field of economy".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the field of economy was ... the place behind which the members of the supervisory board of state-owned companies and state-owned banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making of the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kiev can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new dangers for state-owned companies, but we are not yet aware of any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat of such a law is understandable – it is a great basis for “tolerating” all the achievements in the difficult reform of state enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual control.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should be included in them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill flies under patriotic slogans, others may fly tomorrow – for example, it is possible to demolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written about war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the draft law 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse supervisory councils in one way or another circulates among some people's elected for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, let us consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will provide our suggestions on how to solve the issue of managing state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such an innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company may be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent members of supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Let’s imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the law, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum required by the supervisory board to make any decisions.
On the other hand, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need for competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by the draft law 7176 is likely not to prevent the Supervisory Board from losing the ability to make decisions, but rather will lead to it!
The MP, the author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex, now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom discuss addresses and other sensitive information."
For starters, there are almost no state-owned enterprises of the defense industry in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is in Ukroboronprom, which essentially manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
But even in "Ukroboronprom", according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties not on a free basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the General Director, who, by the way, will decide on the need to relocate one or another enterprise of the defense industry, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism even because the draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the defense industry.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be classified as "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "respected experts-foreigners at the first word "war", in 2021 actually leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of supervisory boards in state-owned enterprises of Ukraine with a full salary of several hundred thousand hryvnias.
First, it is a manipulation – most of these members of supervisory boards have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they “leave Ukraine”, to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also not be forgotten that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have other employment, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively against foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not express identical claims to members of supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
After all, they are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and the war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. I have 2 children with me.

We usually need an adult passport.
In the Brovarsky, Vyshgorodsky and Buchansky districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the invaders, will introduce a reinforced curfew for 2 days.
Pavlyuk’s direct speech: “In the settlements of the Brovarsky, Vyshgorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew has been tightened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, the restrictions will be effective from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the oblast, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can only go outside during an alarm to go into shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and demine the territories.
Omelyanyuk urged people who left these areas to refrain from returning home for the time being.
In the rest of the Kiev region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.
No school has sent anything to me yet, only there is a receipt for payment

The Serbian defense budget has grown exponentially for several years.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in modernizing the army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, climbing 22 places in the list of the most powerful military powers in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible aggravation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, with the force support of special forces "SOBR" three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was wounded.
According to "Clear", when detained, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical care on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be severely stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of the BZD and the administrator of the thematic resources of the BZD in VKontakte and Odnoklassniki Valentin Samasiuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railwaymen were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
Recall: The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenka regime extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage at the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
Belarusian “Rail Partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers to fight, to Ukraine living force and technology.
It's for raising self-esteem.

Even a separate law has been passed on this issue.
We went here for four days, so it's just a horror, not a road.
We drove through the Kiev region, the city of Irpin, then there was horror, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.

We are now a week away from Prague, we have a car, we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it was a separate accommodation.
I put something in the waterphone and connected two unnecessary promotions for which I withdraw funds and I can not turn them off
and also took the money from the card on which they were not

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin’s daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Federation, Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest financial institution in Russia, owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision of more than 600 multinational companies to withdraw from Russia.
The private sector exit includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will ban U.S. citizens from doing business with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including ex-President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions cut them off from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the road is closed and I will come to you

My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant of the company SkyAp, my mother - a seamstress of industrial products, son Makarchyk went to kindergartens.
We lived beautifully, but did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because there is no strength to hide in the cellar.

Therefore, we hope that at first we will be sheltered) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if it will be in our pockets.

We will be grateful for such help at such a difficult time for us.

Good evening, I can not share with you. There is an easterly from Mariupol for a son - alive and in line.
I advise you to read Joe Dispenza, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to the military of the 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military say that they have no weapons left to participate in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said, "The bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in the Russian language.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the soldiers for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that there is a link between the command and the defense forces in Mariupol, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian soldiers at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders dropped a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the soldiers of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. That would be very good
The situation is the same while we stay here
2 hours drive )) walk, mom shopping and back)!
It's not a big deal.
She forgot what she was going to do.
A squadron of Czech drones has started flying over Ukraine since today.
Almost 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them will be used for the direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers “birds” sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevsk city council Vladimir Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends led by the head of the village council and the coordinator of https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Shchur delivered drones for their intended purpose: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of copters - the locations of their deployment will now be kept secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days to Ukraine will send many more interesting “gifts”, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
I don't care, everything is fine. I love sweet, but I can do without it
I'm worried we're not gonna make it.
I will return to Ukraine soon, continue to work
Okay, if it's all right, I'll go with it.
I'll try to do it myself, but if there are any problems, I'll write to you, if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other
We were in person at the old lady in the village in Job,she saw me and that I was pregnant but said that there is no housing
Maybe she’ll be happy and get in the mood.
My phone was repaired today.
And I think I'm freezing out on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but it's better to meet when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I don't care what kind of music you have.
Mom and Dad have to listen.
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's wheelchair.
Today it was cooler and raining. Tomorrow it should be warm.
But not pity destroyed houses, pity people who are bullied by the occupiers
In Kherson, the invaders mocked the "Glory to Ukraine" memorial in Kherson on Perekopskaya Street.
Details: It is noted that unknown persons tore up the flag of the European Union, smashed panels with photos of the Heavenly Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers destroyed the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They took down the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for the carol, we do not have such a custom so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else had to be given
There’s someone to talk to, if anything.
Because I live in a dorm until twelve people will be here, and then go to work
Hello is a little better.
I was in the crib today.
I slept there today.
We have already made great progress.
I'll definitely bring the dumplings another time!
I don’t have the strength to do it today.
Since I push away from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about the month of April because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
May month - I can say about the end of April or the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, I'm sorry I didn't write back for a long time, I cooked dinner and slept a little bit.
If you don't mind, could I come today?
We’ll see you when you arrive.)
He is humble, he has been learning a lot lately. He realized that he needs it very much in his life
Hi, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to work with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson with a lady who is the director of the department of economics at the edge of high.
She was very pleased with my work.
Grishko in the nursery behaved well.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the nursery.
I've been lazy since Friday
I don't do anything but a lot of them and I sleep (and I drink a lot of water <0xE2><0x98><0x9D> a lot of them)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I have yet another analysis.
You don’t have to go again.
Very poorly works drain tank, poorly washes. Needs a master. Needs to set up.
So there is enough
Can you send me the correct email address?
I would like to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you signed up for.
Are the children being fed there or should they be brought with them?
And now for a moment you can come to you there is one question
If you need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t want you to raise money from the beginning, so people didn’t think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, two points were not enough for me:
I will go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Goodnight
It's a great idea. Now I'll watch the video. It'll be good, because the whole family will draw.

I would like to be your backup designer.
How I will be credited the day that I was not at work is a pass
Headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state”.
It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against a neighboring state.
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive group of troops for action in the Slobozhansk direction.
In the coming days, the invaders will probably try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th Separate Motorized Rifle Brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th Combined Arms Army of the Eastern Military District.
Presumably, these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, to restore the losses of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borzya, Trans-Baikal Territory) of the 29th all-military army of the Eastern Military District, recruitment of servicemen from the specified brigade is carried out.
A special problem the enemy feels when completing the positions of drivers and mechanic-drivers.
Departure of selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
Presumably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of combat operations, will continue to strike at the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying or disabling them.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks to strengthen the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in Brest and Gomel regions.
In Slobozhansk direction, separate units of the 6th Combined Arms Army and the coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area continues in the Izyum direction in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
To do this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to launch an offensive in the directions of the settlements of Dovgenke and Dmytrivka, had no success and withdrew to the previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy’s main efforts continue to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutivka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to conduct storming actions in the area of Zolote, was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
The enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopilla, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past 24 hours repulsed four enemy attacks, destroyed five tanks, eight armored units, six vehicles and eight enemy artillery systems.
Don't you understand your thoughts?
We will try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you sleep and I'll keep you
You sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and even more so 1+1. We do not need to adjust :)
I will turn on the TV only to listen to the Czech language
I'm running out of packet fare for a month today :)
Can we do it over the phone today?
Buy fabric for embroidery, canvas, thread for embroidery
I understand that I can prepare material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she's already giving us a lot of pies.
We will meet with my father later, I'm sure you will.
I read the ad on Facebook , so maybe Google wrote something in its own way. , I think the phone number is enough
Hello, we are the things that you brought, but are there things that you can bring on us small in 10 minutes?
I was thinking about work.
If Mr. Director is satisfied, then I can start going to work next week because tomorrow by noon I plan to go to the Labor Office to submit documents (if it works out, because there are very large queues) and on Saturday it rains :)
I am looking for a brigade at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study the Czech language in order to know perfectly, I dream of working on Teva
Friends who are old and not very old, friends with whom I do not know personally, friends in spirit and mind.
There are hard times for you, too.
Over the past month, I’ve been talking to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, turned upside down, as well as the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame because of your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
That’s why they’re putting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you were preparing for a decisive blow.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
Let me tell you a little bit later – as usual, Sasha replied succinctly. – Now, after the search, we are walking through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are struck by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked for Memorial, Novaya Gazeta, Echo of Moscow, Medusa, Navalny’s organization and a number of other places – did many of you do anything to oppose this regime?
Except for taking part in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "It's too late to hide, it's too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your continued indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy and your passive complicity, which now must have put a heavy burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had freedom and democracy to some extent – messy, even bloody, but real.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of confusion that you seek salvation behind the tsar’s back, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think it's safer to be around him.
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as did the Germans from the stasis, you took your soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to lie to the bottom, to renew, to reform and to seize power over the country.
When you were faced with a choice between robbing the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the robbery.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, marking the end of mass rallies for greater social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you still either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya with the ground again, most of you turned a blind eye to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurt, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the children killed, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Brad, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I said, “Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too complicated, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zero, due to rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have become well-earned, some have become rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices have risen, but is that a problem?
Moscow festively shone and glistened from chic.
When several opposition leaders were killed – Yuriy Shchekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror about what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have I met in subsequent years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we hardly did much in the West, if at all we did anything.
A little indignation, a little sanctions; but what difference does it make that Russia is blatantly violating international law when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the heavy 1990s, that was the most important thing.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin switched places with Medvedev again and took the presidency, as before, many of you decided that it was too much, and you went to mass protests.
Navalny's name became evocative, you didn't leave the streets for six months, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
He then struck back.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some received huge deadlines.
"And what could we have done?"
I’ve heard it so often and I still hear it.
“The state is so strong, and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Infuriated by the pro-Russian president who deceived their European hopes, they once seized the Maidan – and never left it again.
They built a tent town on their own and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, rebars and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters went on the attack.
Many died, but they won.
Yanukovych became the fugitive, and Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured the Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but it was of little use.
How many of you were thrilled!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
A new myth was born from somewhere, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find the reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of my friends were mostly silent.
“We don’t care about politics,” he said.
And you hid new in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow began in 2012 – with their binbegs, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.
You barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it in an interview at the time, because I just didn’t understand anything about what was happening in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself in the streets of Homs state snipers cold-bloodedly shooting at peers of my children.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you are familiar with the words of Pastor Martin Niemöller:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I kept quiet because I’m not a socialist.
Then they came for union members, but I kept quiet because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I remained silent because I am not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done that.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really talk now – like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zygar, Maksym Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into a new gulag or forming a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand that when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed – he will take you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went to the protests and still took place for a short time, but soon will get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or who spoke in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for a joke, have not been in the distant past – and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will be left?
The example of Ukrainians – even more so than in 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that reason, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his advantage may be on paper.
Considering everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war in general continues.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be prepared.
You know where it all goes.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your elections are just khachma, your laws, if you do not take into account the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media is no more, your economy is collapsing faster than I am writing, you no longer have credit cards to buy a plane ticket abroad, even if some flights are still left.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try to go somewhere, or you’ll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
Yet there is still one.
Which in the end will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the conditions that have developed, you will need less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not come from you: due to the economic collapse that is approaching Russia, it is most likely to catch fire in the province, in small cities.
When prices go up and salaries are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the streets.
Putin knows this and is much more afraid of these people than he is of the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, of you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as has happened periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be needed. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up almost under any circumstances.
The organization of Navalny was defeated, but it is possible to create other, more informal, more decentralized.
There are so many of you, millions of you.
Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps with a hundred thousand.
If it goes above 300,000, it will be shocked.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to business?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will fear for them.
And that's natural, that's normal.
If I were you, I’d be scared too.
By the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really try to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will throw a joke in a computer game chat – and be arrested; your daughter will express indignation on the Internet – and be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and die in a raw cell under police batons.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only get stronger, acquiring more and more scale.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it's going to end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.

While working in the prosecutor’s office, I thought that I was building a career, I spent a lot of time and effort.
I had a complex psychological, responsible, mental work in which I was completely disappointed.
It's a waste of time, but it's a life experience.
In my personal life, I am sociable, but monogamous and I take matters of marriage seriously.
There was a man I was supposed to marry, but he died, heart problems.
I believe that in order to create a family, people should love, respect, trust each other.
So far, I haven't seen anything like this.
