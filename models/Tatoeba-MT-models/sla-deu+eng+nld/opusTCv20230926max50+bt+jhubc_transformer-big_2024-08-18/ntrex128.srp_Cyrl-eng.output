Welsh members of the assembly are concerned about “similarities with the Mapetians”
Some Members of the Assembly (AM) are dismayed by the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
This happened because it is planned to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of all political determinations worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
One member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that this abbreviation "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means shashasha, and pwp means dung.
A member of the assembly from the political party Plaid said that the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternative names.
A Welsh member of the Conservative Party said his group was "open" to name change, but noted that MWP is pronounced similarly to Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the pronunciation of the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently working on the draft law on the introduction of name changes, made the following statement: "The final decision on the descriptions of the titles of members of the Assembly will, of course, be made by the members themselves."
The Law of the Welsh Government of 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of public consultations on the generally accepted proposals for the appointment of the Assembly by the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to the title of members of the assembly, the Commission opted for the option Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the widest support in public consultations.
Members of the assembly are proposing alternative options, but the fight for consensus could give the chairwoman, Elina Jones, headaches, who is expected to submit a draft law on change within a few weeks.
The laws on reforms will also include other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules for disqualification of members of the Assembly and the plan of the board system.
Members of the Assembly will ultimately vote for their own title during the debate on the aforementioned law.
Macedonians go to the referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to accept the new name of the country "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an effort to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern state represents its territory and has persistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Djordje Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not recognise the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin have subsided, and churches in Harlem are fighting for survival
“Old people I’ve spoken to say there used to be cafes and churches on every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
“Today there is neither one nor the other.”
The disappearance of the cafe is understandable to him.
“People hang out in a different way today,” he says.
“Cafés no longer play the role of daily stays from neighborhoods that people regularly go to.”
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property won’t take as long as executives expect “and sooner or later it will be back in the beginning.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by residential buildings with apartments full of the kind of people who will not help the remaining shrines from the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white," he said, "and that will speed up the closure of these churches because it is unlikely that most of those people who move into these residential buildings will become members of them."
Both churches built communities made up of whites before Harlem became a black metropolis – a metropolitan community in 1870, and St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist community emigrated in the 1930s.
A black community that performed worship nearby took ownership of the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by the black community under priest John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of merchants on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who opposed the employment or promotion of blacks.
The fire of 1939 caused extensive damage to the building, but since the parishioners of Father Johnson decided to rebuild it, they commissioned the organ.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the organ "Orgels of the Poor".
The expert who played the organ in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also pointed out that these are the first organ in the world played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger organ at the Church of Riverside.
Mr. Meriveder has stated that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has taken place in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story about architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were led by world leaders of the church, and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish administration – the governing body of the parish, composed of worldly leaders – wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would seek to transfer the costs” to the parish administration, although the parish administration was not involved in hiring the architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old During Lobster Hunt in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he dived in search of lobsters in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in the town of Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday when he heard the boy's calls for help, and then he and the group rowed up to him to get him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just the excitement of catching lobster, but then “he realized he was shouting, ‘She bit me!
“She bit me.”
Members of the Assembly of all political determinations worry that they may thus become the object of ridicule.
“I called everyone out of the water: ‘The shark is in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to a children's hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark attacked him.
Rescue supervisor Larry Giles said in a press release that a few weeks earlier the shark had already been spotted in the area, but that it had been found not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials closed the access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Karlsbad to Swami’s area in the town of Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles pointed out that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's retail chain plans to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's is becoming a competitor to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams stores with department stores of department store-style cosmetics where professional assistants work.
As part of a significant breakthrough in the UK cosmetics market that turns 2.8 billion pounds, with that figure rising as sales in the fashion and home furnishing markets decline, larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will open up in more stores next year as storefronts roll out.
The investment in cosmetic products comes as supermarkets find ways to take advantage of shelf space after lawsuits for TVs, microwave ovens and home furnishings.
Sainsbury’s has announced that it will double its cosmetics offering to as many as 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with areas for specific brands similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching the Boutique make-up palette to make most products suitable for vegans – for which demand is on the rise when it comes to younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test outlets in two Sainsbury’s stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Purchasing online and switching to the daily purchase of small amounts of food at local stores means that supermarkets have to make an extra effort to attract people to visit them.
Mike Coop, chief executive of Sainsbury’s retail chain, said the department’s outlet will increasingly resemble self-service as the supermarket chain tries to retaliate against high-rebate Aldi and Lidl sales facilities with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s retail chain has opened Argos outlet departments in hundreds of stores and numerous Habitats departments since it bought both of these chains two years ago, which says it has increased food sales and procurement profitability.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to modernize the departments for cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended infamously.
The Sainsbury’s retail chain tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but that partnership ended after a single victory in splitting revenues from pharmaceutical stores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes into effect after Sainsbury’s sold a pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds will play a role in this plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s retail chain, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our departments with beauty products to provide our customers with a better environment.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be at your service to provide advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all needs, and the attractive environment and practical locations make us an indispensable destination for cosmetic products that sets new standards for the way we shop.”
Peter Jones is “out of his mind” after Holly Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job
Peter Jones, the star of the Dragons Den series, has gone “out of his mind” after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million dollar deal with his personal brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wilobi doesn’t have time for their Truly brand of home and accessories.
The couple’s company collaborated with the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old woman announced her departure on Instagram this morning.
Holly Willoughby angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, by withdrawing at the last minute from a lucrative deal with their brand to focus on her own new lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the source, Jones was “furious” when a TV screen lover during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire County, admitted that due to new offerings worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, she no longer had enough time to devote to their brand of home-made and extra.
The company collaborated with the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow and was projected to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced via Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Holly put the Truly brand at the top of her priorities.
It was supposed to be her long-term plan to earn money over the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch date.
The warehouse at the Marlowe headquarters is packed with ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning host, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in a wide range of products, from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings, as well as possible further delays in the launch date.
This could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is a mother of three and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and in March Jones, 52, joined them as the company's director.
These couples spend the holidays together and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production house.
Willoughby will become the M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ent McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
After the difficult words "sympathy showed up"
He has been criticized in the media for comments that some say are "not worthy of a president" and for his positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump withdrawing so much?
Trump said, imitating the voice of a TV commentator.
“We’re not retreating from anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump praised their initial June meeting in Singapore as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations on denuclearization, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, top North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that there was no “appropriate response” from the United States to North Korea’s initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he stressed, the United States is not lifting sanctions that exert uninterrupted pressure.
Trump made a much more optimistic statement in his speech.
“We are making great progress with North Korea,” he said.
“We have been at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would suffer.
We have a great relationship now.”
He stressed that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results – missile tests had ended, hostages had been released, and the remaining U.S. troops had returned home.
He defended this unusual approach by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be a decent president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing there,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd of people right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so we are facing some difficulties," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Pal, it is still unclear whether foreign staff can work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palo to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to participate in providing assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes that are shaking Indonesia, it is regrettable how unprepared this country is for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in A<0xC4><0x87>eh, they are rarely found on other shores.
The loss of life was probably also contributed by the apparent failure to advertise the tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was in effect.
Traveling between numerous Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship stationed on the island of Lombok to point to help the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Yoko Widodo focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's aged infrastructure and did not save money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of financial resources hit Mr. Yoko's administration, and next year he is due to be re-elected.
Mr. Yoko also faces pressures that create long-lasting sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the majority Muslim population have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes while Christian and Muslim gangs clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows and other cruel weapons.
Daniel Starage, a Liverpool player, manages to score an equal point against Chelsea
Daniel Starage saved Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Chelsea on Saturday, scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Starjj received an addition from Jerdan Shaqiri at 27 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team lost 1-0.
At first, he moved the ball to the left side, and then kicked it to the farthest part of the net.
The ball went high above the nude in the direction of the right upper corner of the net.
She eventually flew over goalkeeper Capp Arizabalaga who jumped to catch her and crashed into the net.
I was just trying to set myself up and adjust for a kick, and players like Shaqiri are always playing forward as much as possible, so I just tried to fight for as much time as possible,” Starage told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, I touched one ball and just kicked it, without much thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the half after the goal of Belgian star Eden Azar in the 25th minute.
The Blues' striker returned the ball to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> fifth, then turned in the middle of the pitch and ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> exchanged a few short blows in the middle of the field.
Then he directed a great centrifuge, leading Azar to the goal.
Hazard overtook the defense and sent the final left-footed shot to the farthest part of the net next to Alison Becker, a Liverpool player.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will meet Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Tuesday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the disaster management agency on Sunday morning.
Numerous reports have arrived for people trapped in the ruins of buildings struck by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that hit Indonesia on Friday and triggered up to 6 meters of height waves, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho spokesman said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 people, has been ravaged by the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death.
An investigation into the murder was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Berkenhead, in Merseyside County.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Muse, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called people in the area who have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would invite anyone who was near John Street in Berkenhead to see or hear something suspicious to contact us.
I would also invite everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a camera on the dashboard to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was living in Berkenhead and that she was found on the property.
This afternoon, friends who feel they know this woman came to the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim's closest relative.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Muse had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him that everyone was forbidden to enter and leave the building.
He was left without a text when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told that their return would be allowed only in a few hours.
It was rumored that a police officer told one man that the entire area was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the scene.
She kept saying, “This is terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were at the border with another van in front.
Several police officers stood in the border watching the apartment blocks.
All those who have some information are invited to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crimestoppers Association anonymously at 0800 555 111 and report 247 from 30 September.
The statue of Cromwell in front of the parliament building becomes the subject of the latest debate about monuments due to a dispute about the “falsification of history”
Its removal would be poetic justice for its Taliban-style destruction of many English cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to falsify history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of Westminster Palace was an inevitable goal in the current debate over the removal of the statues.
Cromwell neither issued an order nor carried out iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the work of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Turnicroft attests to 19th-century thinking and is part of the historiography of a figure who, in many ways, still deserves to be glorified.
Mr. Goldsmith made the following statement to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
The credibility of this description has been the subject of constant debate throughout history.
What is certain is that this mid-17th century conflict shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell as an individual is a recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His success as Lord Protector also deserves to be praised and kept from being forgotten.”
Swine Killer Inflicted Deadly Injuries on Chinese Farmer
According to local media reports, a villager was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man, identified only by his last name "Juan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered with blood near a pig at a market in the town of Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday.
The owner of a pig farm is preparing to inject pigs in Xinning in Qinghai province, China.
He reportedly came with a relative from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the pig that had blood on its mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-pound pig had inflicted fatal injuries on a farmer, the report said.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” said a relative named Wu, according to Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4.40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Juan or his cousin.
The manager of the market told Evening News that the pig was locked in order not to attack anyone again, while police were gathering evidence on the spot.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this rarely happens, there are already recorded cases of swine attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, inflicting critical injuries on a man.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig was holding a Welsh farmer chained to a tractor until his wife drove the animal away.
After Oregon peasants ate pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can be their “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they're very curious... they don't intend to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Ross will bring widespread splashes to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken as it moves across the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring splashes to the north of Maxick and the southwest of the United States that will lead to flooding.
Rosa, with winds of 137 km/h on Saturday morning at 5 a.m., was a Category 1 hurricane and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
As expected, Ross will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure field begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward, toward the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push high tropical moisture northward, toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 cm of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical humidity due to contact with a low-pressure field approaching will lead to widespread splashes in the southwest.
The amount of rain from 2.5 to 10 cm in local areas will cause dangerous torrential flooding, water damage and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will occasionally cause rainfall of about 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is also expected to rain 5 to 10 cm in some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Heavy flooding is possible with a sharp deterioration of conditions due to the uncontrollable nature of tropical rains.
It would be extremely reckless to walk into the desert as the danger of tropical rains threatens.
Due to heavy rainfall, canyons can turn into swinging rivers, and thunderstorms will lead to turbulent winds and dust in the air.
A low-pressure field approaching will bring locally strong rain in some parts of the southern California coast.
Precipitation amounts of more than 1.5 cm are possible, which can cause less water damage and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region for their rainy season.
Mestitial tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and on Monday evening and Tuesday rainfall will sweep the wider area.
The splashes will extend to the southwestern part of Colorado, southeastern Utah, northeastern Arizona, and northwestern New Mexico on Tuesday, and will last until Wednesday.
In October, large temperature oscillations are possible across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while in the tropics it will retain quite warm weather.
This sometimes causes huge differences in temperature at small distances.
A great example is the dramatic temperature differences in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and De Moine in Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees.
The long-lasting summer heat will grow and spread again over the next few days.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start to October is expected with temperatures of 27 degrees Celsius in much of the country, from the southern plains to the northeastern parts.
Temperatures in New York could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high chance of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimonies of Supreme Court Justice candidates Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly committed in the 1980s, on six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political crisis continued, with broadcasters cutting off the regular Friday program due to a last-minute twist: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI should conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that the drunk Kavanaugh had touched her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a touching testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people on Friday, according to a report by Nielsen.
It counted the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other networks displaying it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
At the same time, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of spectators in offices.
By comparison, that number of spectators can match the audience that follows the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, with hosts of the show "Opinion" that strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, recorded the highest viewership of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
This process aroused great interest even after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
After a statement from the moderate Republican's office said he would vote in Kavanaugh's favor, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters yelling at him as he tried to connect by elevator at a hearing of the Justice Committee.
He stood for a few minutes looking down while being insulted, which CNN broadcast live.
“Here I am standing in front of you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the states?
They said to him, ‘You have power, and so many women are helpless.’”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator closed, he said he had more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and television companies broadcast live events hours later when the Justice Committee was due to vote to forward Kavanaugh's candidacy to the full Senate.
However, Flake said he only agreed to do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which was persistently demanded by the Democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talking to Koons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice had a weightlifter it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” in the case of Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the UK’s future and undermining national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference on September 29, 2018 in Birmingham, UK.
In a second interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Checkers Brexit plan, calling the proposal for a single customs zone between Britain and the EU "completely meaningless".
Wade Sims Murder: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson Suspect for Death of University of Louisiana Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the murder of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at the University of Louisiana.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed behind bars on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the clash between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses from the scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, a WAFB channel connected to the CBS network reports.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to Wade's fatal wound with a gunshot.
He was given a $350,000 bail, the lawyer said.
The parish pathologist's office in East Baton Rouge on Friday released a preliminary report citing a gunshot wound from a bullet through the head to the neck as the cause of death.
The department attributes its assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest to the Louisiana State Police Operations Unit for capturing fugitives, the State Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and local residents.
The director of the athletics department at the University of Louisiana, Joe Aleva, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “enforcing and striving for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
The past zones averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“It’s something that worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
The ashes ejected by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern parts of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and registered 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
This center has recorded more mild seismological activity.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windshields in municipalities of Mexico City, such as Kho<0xC4><0x8D>imilko.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake rocked central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with the intervention police, while thousands joined counter-demonstrations on the first anniversary of a Catalan vote on secession that divided the population.
A group of masked separatists, restrained by the intervention police, threw eggs at them and threw paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually roar from tourists.
Later in the day, there was also a fight that the police were holding back the bucks.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “No Forgetting, No Forgiveness” in the face of Unionist Protestants shouting “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people received help because of minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media reports.
Tensions remain unabated in the region, which is set for independence a year after a referendum held on October 1 that separatist Catalans celebrate, even though Madrid has declared it illegal.
Voters voted overwhelmingly for independence, though the response was small as the mass of people who opposed secession boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region, leading to violent clashes.
Independence groups camped on Friday night to prevent demonstrations in support of national police forces.
Demonstrations were held, but the route had to be changed.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who came with his wife to protest the separatists, said he had lost hope that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we experienced one of the brightest moments.
“My parents were crying out for happiness to be able to vote, but now we are in a hopeless situation,” he said.
Despite achieving a key but narrow victory in last December’s regional elections, Catalan independence parties have had difficulty continuing in the same spirit this year, as many of their most famous leaders have either been in self-imposed exile or in detention where they await an independent trial for their bodies.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who telephoned a protest in support of the police, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is tense,” he said.
Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial in prison since late last year, has announced that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Providing a candidacy for the European elections is the best way to condemn the collapse of democratic values and the repression we have suffered from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londoners: Man Arrested After Hitting House With Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after driving into a house in London.
The incident took place on Thursday in Ballynagard Crescent Street around 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the entrance and the building itself were damaged.
It is also possible that at some point a crossbow was fired at the house.
Shooting Menge brings Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga secures first goal for Livingston
Livingston surprised Rangers on his move to the Premier League by forcing Steven Gerard to admit only his second loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Stadium.
Dolly Manga brought the change with his goal, as Gary Holt's team equated with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team this season remains without a guest win in the Premier League, and next week he meets with the leaders in the Harts table, which is behind eight points.
Before that, Rangers will be hosting Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston extended the line-up without defeat in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not yet defeating since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed odds against uninspired guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal he scored, as the offensive game caused Rangers problems at all levels.
Scott Robinson broke through, but wore the ball in front of the goal, so that Alan Litgow would kick it past the net after sneaking in to receive a blow with Craig Halkett's head in front of the goal.
The hosts gladly let the Rangers players play in front of them, knowing that they could cause difficulties to the visiting team with the played actions.
That’s how they scored the key goal.
Rangers committed a misdemeanour, and Livingston opened the match after a free kick, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson combining to recruit Menga to pass the ball into the goal from the mid-sixteen.
In the previous part of the game, Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but could not break the defense of the host, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
The same style continued in the second half, although Kelly had to defend one shot by Alfred Morelos.
Alan McGregor, a Rangers goalkeeper, repulsed Scott Pittman's attack and Litgow scored next to the goal in Livingston's second-winning action.
Livingston defended several center shots, and two penalty shootouts were also rejected – following Halkett's objection to replacing Glen Middleton and one for handball.
Livingstone’s “Phenomenal Game” – Analysis
Alasder Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
All players, without exception, have been outstanding and once again exceed expectations on this upward trajectory.
Since returning to the front row, they have not almost changed the style of the game and people, but one should give great credit to Holt for the way he brought vivacity to the team since his arrival.
There were so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unrivalled in leading the top organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on standby all along.
However, Rangers was not inspired.
No matter how good he once was under Gerard, he fell far below that level.
They couldn’t score — they only broke through the host’s defense once — and it’s a kind of alarm bell for Rangers, which is in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an met with mixed reception in the Colony
The meeting between the leaders of Turkey and Germany on Saturday (September 29th) during breakfast in Berlin was accompanied by mixed reactions.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the majority of the Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police blocked the gathering of 25,000 people outside the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The clashes reflect a divided view of a visitor who some Turks in Germany forge as a hero, while others accuse him of being an autocrat.
Accident on the road in Depford: a cyclist was killed in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, on a busy road in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics showed him help, but the man died on the spot.
A few months before the crash, another cyclist was killed in Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday’s crash, which the driver struck and fled.
Metropolitan police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed, and drivers are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Wounded in Riots
Six prison police officers were injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison said.
The riots, which are still ongoing, occurred at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. British summer time.
A team of Tornado specialists was brought in to overcome the riots that were reduced to one wing and in which eight prisoners participated.
The police were given assistance on the spot due to minor injuries to the person.
A Prison Service spokesman said: “Specially trained prison officials have been brought in for an ongoing incident at Her Majesty’s Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members received help due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and our position is clear that those responsible will be reported to the police, which could keep them behind bars for longer.”
Her Majesty's Long Lartin prison has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the state.
In June, it was reported that the prison administrator was on hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, police were called to jail for serious riots in which staff were attacked by billiard balls.
The cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City are threatened by Hurricane Rosa with torrential floods (which can well reach drought-stricken areas)
Tropical depression rarely affects Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week as Hurricane Rosa moves across the desert in the southwest, bringing with it the risks of torrential flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona in southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Ross is expected to reach Phoenix directly on Tuesday, and her approach will be announced by rain on Monday evening.
The National Weather Service of Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression at 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) hit a region 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the national hurricane center predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm, with amounts up to 15 cm in isolated places, such as Mogolon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the desert in the southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to be 2.5–5 cm, with possible totals in isolated places and up to 10 cm.
For areas where there is no fear of torrential rain floods that Rosa will bring, it can be a blessing since the region has been hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious cause for concern, rain will be welcome in some parts as drought is currently reigning in the southwest.
“According to the U.S. Drought Surveillance Agency, just over 40 percent of Arizona has been hit at least by extreme drought, a second-order category,” the report said.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to a landslide on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning still had hurricane strength with maximum winds of 135 kilometers per hour, is currently 620 kilometers south of the Punta Eugenia settlement in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.
The storm encounters colder waters in the Pacific Ocean, so it has lost its strength.
That is why it is expected that the landslide in Mexico will occur when the storm reaches the strength of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, heavy rainfall is possible, which brings a significant risk of flooding.
“A total amount of precipitation of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Lower California to the northwestern part of Sonora state, with a possible as much as 10 cm,” reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move northward across Mexico as a tropical storm, to reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, which will then move upward through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late on Tuesday night.
“The main danger expected from Rose or her remains is a very heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the American desert in the southwest,” the National Hurricane Monitoring Center said in a statement.
This rainfall is expected to lead to life-threatening torrential floods and the spread of watersheds in deserts and landslides on hilly terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
After a 16-year-old boy with stab wounds was found in Somerst, three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The injured teenager was found at the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the town of Radstock, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have asked anyone who may have footage of the event on their mobile phones to contact her.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered Frustration and Anger' from Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the relentless and shameful tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in a speech in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the scourge and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh, in a vigorous and emotional testimony on Thursday before Congress, denied Christine Blazey Ford’s claims that he sexually abused her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At this hearing, Ford also testified about her claims.
The president said on Saturday that on that day “the American people saw all the genius, quality and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“A positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a first-class biography in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination during a speech on the importance of Republicans' turnout in midterm elections.
“Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“Although I’m not running personally, I’m actually running,” he said.
"That's why I'm all over the country fighting for great candidates."
Trump concluded that the Democrats are on a mission of “providing resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural Senate floor vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday, according to a senior GOP aide to CNN.
Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami left hundreds dead, and the number continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them carried away by giant waves that hit beaches when Indonesia’s Sulawesi island was hit by a major earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered in the town of Palu on Friday for a beach festival when at dawn waves six meters high struck the coast, bringing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When he threatened the tsunami yesterday, people continued their activities on the beach, instead of fleeing immediately and becoming victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency BNPB, said in a press release.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, but it dragged cars, trees, houses and hit everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled across the high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to avoid a tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in the city of Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster relief agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges crooked and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal town was hit again.
In the area where 2.4 million people live, a series of earthquakes were felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said Friday’s quake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It is possible that the geographical characteristics of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, contributed to the development of a greater tsunami strength," he said.
Nugroho said the damage was “huge” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been demolished.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the ruins of the building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said major losses and damage were possible along the coast 300 km north of the city of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications "were completely cut off and there was no information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its personnel and volunteers had moved to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received criticism from various sides that it had not issued a notice that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared via social media, a man on the upper floor of the building is heard screaming from spotted veins, warning people on the street in a tsunami approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hit the coast, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that caused a disruption in communications around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue activities.
Authorities said the military had begun sending cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but that the evacuated people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was reopened only for aid arriving and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo has scheduled a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami hit more than 800.
The situation is extremely bad.
The staff of the World Vision humanitarian organization arrived safely from Dongala to the city of Palua, where employees are hiding in shelters from waterproof canvas placed in the backyard of the office and on the way to the city they were greeted by the scenes of destruction and devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is extremely bad.
Even when relief groups began taking the first steps to mitigate the disaster, there were complaints that foreign aid workers with deep expertise were not allowed to travel to Pal.
According to Indonesian regulations, the influx of overseas assets, supplies and people is possible only if the crash site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still characterised as a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“When state institutions declare a national disaster, we can provide international assistance, but for now there is no such status.”
When the second night fell on Pal after the earthquake and tsunami that struck it on Friday, friends and family of the missing still cherished the hope that their loved ones would somehow miraculously escape the sad fates of the victims of natural disasters.
The little boy was pulled out of the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman under the rubble who had been trapped next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
The rest of the prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, Mr. Mandagi added.
“As a senior in paragliding, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recounted how, hours after news of the Roa Roa hotel’s demolition reached the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to contestants in Palu who were attending a beach festival.
However, his messages wore only one gray mark, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages haven’t been delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport on the Levee facility
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink’s employee who filled an ATM at Newport on the Levee on Friday morning, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to inject more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “ran behind the back of an employee at Brink’s” and stole a bag of money that was supposed to be thrown into an ATM.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
All those who have information about their identities are invited to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to "Ye".
Posting the change on his Twitter account on Saturday, he wrote: “It will once be known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time, so he used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is expected to announce a new album, "Yandhi".
He was invited to the show instead of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's author said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously stated that the word has religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible and means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with a radio host named Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m all of us, that’s us.
From the name of Kanja, which means ‘the one’, I have gone on to simply ‘Ye’ (you) – which is the personification of all that is good, bad, and vague in us.
This album is basically a reflection of who we are.”
He is just one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, known by his nicknames Puff Daddy, P Didy or Didy, said this year that he would like to be referred to as "Love" and "Brother Love".
West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, used a nickname with or without a dash and capital letters.
Mexico's President, AMLO, vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of his bloody retaliation against the country’s cold.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed on Saturday in a square in Tlatelolco that he would “never use the military to carry out repression against the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on peaceful protesters gathered in the square and killed as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were based in Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing financial assistance each month to those studying and by opening more free state universities.
He said that unemployment and the inability to get an education push young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the development of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, says investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various foreign U.S. governments announced the development of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. generally does not have an official strategy for doing so.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to be No. 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“For starters, it would be good to double the budget for artificial intelligence research, since all other countries are so much whining for the United States, and we are striving for new progress in this area,” Lee said.
Doubling funds could double the chances of the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Super-Powers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, works as the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee paid tribute to previous technology competitions by the U.S. government, such as the U.S. Department of Defense’s “Robot Challenge” for New Technology Development (DARPA), and asked when the next one would take place to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state scholarships, Lee said.
“Academic leaders don’t go to China, they go to big corporations,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have employed prominent minds from universities to work on developing artificial intelligence.
Li points out that changes in immigration policy could help the United States to strengthen its AI aspirations.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctors in the field of artificial intelligence,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council presented a plan for the development of next-generation artificial intelligence.
China’s National Endowment for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to how the National Endowment for Science and other governmental organizations allocate money to American researchers, with the quality of academic work lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center that will include partners from the sector and from the academy, while the White House announced the formation of a select committee for artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA has announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called Next Generation Artificial Intelligence.
On the other hand, the National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than 100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that required the establishment of a National Security Commission for artificial intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", ending a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked their bids for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighboring northern state represents its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on a proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would jeopardize the ethnic identity of the Macedonian, mostly Slavic population.
President Djordje Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach a minimum of 50 percent, as much as it takes for the referendum to be valid.
The referendum question on the ballot is: "Are you in favor of membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are of the view that this is a price worth paying in exchange for membership in alliances such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
While this is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have said they will obey the result of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required to change the name.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters went to the polls.
"I went out to vote because of my children, because we have a place in Europe," said Djose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the Macedonian capital, Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev voted in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia with his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, to change the name of the country that should open the country's path to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and sets up chairs in front of the tents set up by opponents of the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join upright heads, not through the entrance for service," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev argues that NATO membership would bring over the necessary investment to Macedonia, in which the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will be ‘yes’ because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for EU and NATO membership,” Zaev said after the vote.
He added that the result "for" would be a "confirmation of our future".
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will turn out for the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
The second poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, concluded that 57 percent of voters will turn out for the referendum.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to succeed, half of the registered voters plus one must vote.
Failure in the referendum would have given the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since taking power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero passes Brighton's entire defense and scores a goal
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling defeated Brighton on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, winning a 2-0 win for Manchester City.
It seemed too easy when Agüero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian attacker received an add-on in the middle of the field from where the attack began.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, so he mowded them all in the open field.
At that time, Agüera was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He outplayed one defender and overtook a few others on the edge of Brighton's goal.
Then he kicked the ball to the left, finding Sterling.
The English wing player immediately returned the ball to Agüer, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a right-hand dice by shooting to the right of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," Pep Guardiola, manager of Manchester City, told reporters.
“We agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's how it was.
We were lucky to have scored a goal at the time.”
However, the initial advantage of the Skyscrapers in the Premier League meeting was brought by Sterling.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that action, Aguero received the ball deep in Brighton territory.
He directed a wonderful addition to Leroy Sein on the left.
Sein had several contacts with the ball before recruiting Sterling on the second tripod.
The Skyscraper's attacker inserted the ball into the net, then immediately slipped out of the field.
Manchester City will meet Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. in a Champions League match at the Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play against Rocky game without competitive significance for Nationals
Since Nationals was eliminated from the playoffs, there was little reason to insist on another game.
However, competitive Scherzer hopes to take a position on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, who have one game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers, are still in the playoff game.
The Rockies secured a wild-card spot on Friday night with a 5–2 win over Nationals, but are still trying to win their first division title.
“Although we can’t get anything, at least we can get out on the field knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team is likely to be at the highest level against any point I would play this year.
Why wouldn’t I participate in such a competition?”
Nationals has not yet announced the starter for the week, but they are reportedly considering letting Scherzer throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th time to open the game, held a training session on Thursday and will throw on Sunday when he otherwise rests.
Washington's right-handed player this season leads 18-7 with an average of 2.53 and 300 car strikes in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia.
The president briefly referred to the situation of his Supreme Court Justice nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, during a speech on the importance of Republicans' midterm response to the election.
“Everything we’ve achieved will be put on a roll in November.
Five weeks separates us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
These are some of the biggest – even though I’m not running personally, I’m actually running and that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continues: “Look at this horrible radical group of Democrats, look at what’s happening now.
They are determined to regain power without choosing the means, see the mischief, dirty games.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control, because what they want is power and control, and we won’t give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of “providing resistance and obstruction.”
“You could see it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “rabid, vile, disgusting and insincere.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator and Justice Committee member Diane Feinstein by name, which caused a loud outcry from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document to the public?
Uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for him – it was a very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party no longer accepts different views.
There is no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for my censorship, it almost didn’t surprise me.
I am only the last in a series of Labour MPs who have been told that they are not welcome – just because we have expressed our opinions.
My colleague in parliament, Joan River, went through a similar process because she was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship initiative followed criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe – the irony is that these are similar topics on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
A notice to the Labour Party meeting in East Nottingham said Friday that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
In the eight years that I have been a member of the Labour Party Parliament, Friday evening meetings of the General Committee have generally been just that.
Unfortunately, meetings in this spirit are seldom held today, and the promise of a “nobler, more moderate” policy has long been forgotten, if there ever was such aspiration.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and any opinion is assessed according to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It began shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would share similar political views began to expect me to change them from the roots and take positions with which I would otherwise never agree – whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every public address of mine – regardless of what I say – follows a tirade of abuses on social networks in which it calls for the annulment of my choice, condemns the policy of the center, says that I do not belong in the Labour Party.
I am not the only one with that experience.
I am aware that I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments addressed to me are usually political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, without ever being distracted by it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that various types of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The real truth is that we no longer accept different attitudes and with each vote of distrust or change of the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more blunt.
In the past two years, I have been often advised, inviting me to lower my head, to keep my opinion to myself, and then I would be “fit.”
But it is at odds with my political goals.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago from a school bench, caused by the government’s negligence of Margaret Thatcher, who allowed my classroom to literally collapse, I’ve struggled to provide better public services to those most in need – either as a local councilor or as a minister in government.
I never hid my political determination, not even in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could in any way be confused about my political beliefs and themes on which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this initiative on Friday, I would just like to say that, in the moments when our country is heading towards Brexit that will threaten our households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
Yet my only message is not to the Momentum of Nottingham, but to my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of annulment of my choice or political cunning will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: the undefeated Air climbs to the top
The two late essays may have somewhat distorted the final score, but there is no doubt that Ayr won a well-deserved victory in this exciting game of the day in Tennent's Premier League.
Now they are at the top of the table, as the only undefeated side out of a total of ten.
In the end, the home team took the lead thanks to the superior defense, as well as the greater number of opportunities used, and coach Peter Murci had every right to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in the games so far and we have not yet experienced a defeat, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "All the praise for Ir, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute essay, turned into Frasier Climo, brought Ira an advantage, but the yellow card for Scotland's captain, Rory Hughes, who had been taken out by the Warriors from the east, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggott grabbed it.
Klim<0xC3><0xB3> increased Ayr's lead with a penalty, before, half-time, scoring and converting a solo essay to allow Ayr to score 17-5 on break.
However, Melrose started well in the second half, and an essay by Patrick Anderson, turned Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a longer standstill due to the serious injury of Ruarid Nott, who was carried out on stretchers, and Ayr further increased his leadership with an essay by Stafford McDowell, who was turned into Climo.
Then Ira's deputy captain, Blair McPherson, was given a yellow card and Melrose reaped the player advantage more by failing to convert the essay, after a short period of intense pressure.
However, the foreign host returned and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for wrestling with the no-ball Clima, from the line of penalties, McPherson entered a down point behind the Ira Mall in the attack.
Climo turned the essay, which he did again almost immediately in the sequel, after Kyle Rowe picked up David Armstrong's punch and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth homepage essay.
The star of the series "Still Game" is preparing for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan is preparing to move into the hospitality industry after learning that he has been appointed director of a company that holds licensed restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular television series, in which he co-wrote the screenplay and starred alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the show's final season and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the news, although a source for the Scottish Sun newspaper hinted that Kiernan wanted to join the "successful restaurant sector" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, hopes that the court will again allow it to go to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling at the naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are glimmers of the color of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the slogan: “We have full right to the sea.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has been deprived of access to the sea, there is still a vivid memory of the loss of coastline in a bloody conflict over resources with Chile in the 19th century, and with it a longing for another voyage to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivian current development of the situation is at hand, it is ruled by a spirit of unity and tranquility and, of course, expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Kalsadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that – after decades of talks – Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign exit to the Bolivian sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic president of indigenous origin – who is expected to face a controversial re-election battle next year – the verdict to be passed on Monday also carries a lot of risks.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia – and that little would change even when that would happen.
The UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to assign Chilean territory and said it would not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice is pronounced only six months after the final arguments have been heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And not only has the Bolivian case not progressed, but the previous four years may have reversed it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Zarate said.
Morales’s belligerent rhetoric has killed off any affection for Chile, she pointed out.
Bolivia and Chile will continue talks at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Edwardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed with the claim that the court made the decision unusually quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given an “extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit,” he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Morales – who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political backbone.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“This judgment is an opportunity to see the necessity of overcoming the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If It Doesn't Trust the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never lift their nuclear weapons program unless they have confidence in Washington.
Ri made a speech before the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit in the talks of the conflicting leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to have barely restarted stale diplomatic negotiations on nuclear weapons more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ree says it’s only a dream that continuing sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is not ready to accept the declaration until Pyongyang takes significant steps in the disarmament process.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
However, the government is sceptical about the seriousness of Pyongyang’s renunciation of its nuclear arsenal, which its country probably sees as the only guarantee of its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows feature the latest lines of bulky head-covering accessories that you’ll soon see on the nearby main street
If you want to enrich the collection of hats with bulkier models or completely block the sun, the search is over.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a series of crazy huge head accessories from their Spring/Summer 2019 collection that overshadowed everything at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats set Instagram on fire this summer, and these designers showed off their impressive creations on the runway.
Among Valentine's pieces, the most prominent was the overemphasized beige hat decorated with a wide rim resembling feathers, which swallowed the heads of the model by its size.
Other bulky accessories include watermelons decorated with jewelry, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapples – but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks – at the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creation was reminiscent of diving equipment complete with a blowtorch and a mask, while the other looked like melted ice cream in a cornet.
And if you follow the trend of attracting attention to bulky fashion details – you are in luck.
Those who follow the trends predict that huge hats could soon be worn on nearby main streets.
The bulky hats follow the appearance of the popular straw hat “La Bomba” with a two-meter-wide rim that walked many celebrities – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic label on this impractical hat, which flooded social media, stood behind another large creation that was shown on the runway – a straw beach bag almost the same size as the model in the swimsuit that wore it.
In the collection “La Riviera” for spring/summer 2019 at the Fashion Week in Paris, the most prominent bag was a raffia in the color of burnt orange, trimmed with raffia and with a white leather handle on top.
Stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect the big hats and beach bags to arrive in the main street next summer – since the designer has made such a boom, it would be difficult to ignore such a demand for bulky accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of the language is crucial for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland boast outstanding academic achievements, and this continued in 2018 with a new series of outstanding test scores, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service for students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare students for further and higher education, a chosen career and a place in society as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement its own curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language he understands, it’s going to get into his head.
If you speak in his native language, it will touch his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s tests, we see that the languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest passing grades in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those learning German, 69 percent of those learning French and 63 percent of those learning Spanish also received an A score.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland value foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now given the same importance as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
In a 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission, 17 percent of the reasons that employers cited as the main problems in filling vacancies were attributed to language ignorance.
That is why language skills are being given more and more importance in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the multiple potential business opportunities that languages require, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future because they possess a skill like this for a lifetime.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries automatically puts a person who speaks multiple languages ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent said they did not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those spoken in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In each school in Scotland, different languages will be taught.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will learn languages considered to be most important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever interests your child, there will always be more languages to choose from in independent schools, with teaching staff who are proficient in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary for success, whatever awaits them in the future.
It cannot be denied that nowadays, in a global business environment, languages are still crucial for the future of the country, so they must also have their place in education.
Modern languages, in fact, should be considered "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to provide young people in Scotland with this choice, diversity and outstanding achievements.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
It’s coming to an end for fans who want to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a week-long pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But his exact minute has yet to be determined.
“There will be more than one, and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely have limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game Lakers pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
The timing of the Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies tonight as part of an election campaign in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five planned Trump rallies for next week, with detentions in friendly places, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a vote postponed to confirm his candidate’s vacancy at the Supreme Court, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time will Trump hold a rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Willing, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7pm Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be watched online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about this week’s hearings for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual harassment, with the expected vote to confirm admission to the Senate delayed by a week until the FBI completes the investigation.
However, this series of rallies is held primarily to help Republicans gain support for the November elections.
As part of President Trump’s campaign, the five rallies, which will take place next week, are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“The importance of Congressional control is so great for his work program that the president will travel to as many states as possible at the start of the tumultuous campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, could gather supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, with media coverage from Pittsburgh,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia, a country where he won elections with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016, will be the second in a month on Saturday.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate nominee in West Virginia, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come in to try to pick him up in polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team demonstrates determination to stay in the game to meet singles matches on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon’s doubles tournament may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needs.
Although momentum variability is a fictional sports concept, players really believe in it, especially in competitions of this type.
On whose side would you say the momentum is now?
“They had a lead of six points, and now four, so we can say that the momentum is on our side,” said Jordan Spitt on his way out.
Europe, of course, is ahead of us with four points and another twelve in the game.
Although Americans, according to Spite, get a little wind in the back and have a lot on their side, especially the form of Spite and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each has three points out of four.
Spit was killed from the first to the last blow and assigned everyone homework.
The cheers became louder during his round, eventually playing a key final shot and getting a fourth match with the same result when he and Thomas were two behind after two.
His final blow to a 15-hole match was met with a similar scream, reflecting the belief that the American team did not fail.
“Basically, you just have to do your best and take care of your own match,” Spit said.
That’s all these players can do.
18 holes to leave a seal.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are no doubt telling the story of the Ryder Cup.
Unusual and at the same time charming European couple won all four matches and the game without mistakes.
Mollywood was the only couple not to have played the gods' strikes on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and in the second half on Friday morning.
The game, which they have shown so far and the way they exchange energy with a noisy audience, solidified them as the main favorites on Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could take a potential European victory at sunset over Le Golf National’s pitches.
Possibly both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about European celebrations.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly overcame Sergio Garcia, a morning hero in a four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The gods and double gods in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swedes in a hole from which they never even managed to spring.
But on Sundays, there's no one to help you get out of the hole.
The four-ball game and the pairs tournament are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they give and don’t give and the way the strategy can change in a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a big lead ahead of the final day, but this pairing session has also shown that the US team has a desire for a fight that some have doubted, especially in the continental part of America.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of Ryder Cup final day
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage, as after Saturday's matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament, it gained an advantage of 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired couple, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were the first to lead with two victories over the downtrodden Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European side of Thomas Bjorn, who fought to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the imprecise American side in the morning four-ball game and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. gave more resistance to the pairs tournament, winning two matches, but could not reduce the backlog.
Jim Furrick's side must win eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutante to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, dubbed Mollywood after a fantastic weekend, are just the second pair in the history of the Ryder Cup to score four points in the first four matches.
After running over Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they then blended in brilliantly and overpowered the pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Deschambo with even more convincing 5–4.
Woods, who made it through two matches on Saturday, shone for a moment, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in the four-ball game and in the doubles tournament and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the doubles tournament and suffered a 2–1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Capque – first and third in the world rankings.
Europe, however, did not all go according to plan on this pleasant, clear day southwest of Paris.
Three-time Majors winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set a goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They fought a 2–1 victory over John Ram and Jan Pulter in a four-ball game, and later returned and defeated Pulter and Rory McElroy 4–3 in a pairing tournament, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a team return after a four-point gap before the singles matches, although Furyk's side, which defends the title, was enough to keep the trophy.
However, after already two days in second place, it seems that the counterattack on Sunday would be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says there will be “no talk” of unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister on Saturday told the United Nations that the extension of sanctions deepened its distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country would never unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant measures to demonstrate goodwill” over the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising not to multiply nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But there is no appropriate U.S. response," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no question that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea for step-by-step steps, his statement was significant because he did not expel unilateral denuclearization from the game as Pyongyang had previously done.
Ri called for a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit held between the incumbent US President and North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work to “denuclearize the Korean Peninsula,” while Trump pledged to provide North Korea with a safe gas pipeline.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also deafened calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States does not give up denuclearization first and foremost and increases the level of pressure with sanctions in order to achieve its goal by force, in opposition to even a ‘declaration of an end to the war’,” he said.
“What they think sanctions can bring us to our knees are just the dreams of people who don’t know anything about us.
But the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader spoke about at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed out three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If we were to negotiate this denuclearization issue with South Korea rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not come to such a dead end.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech differed drastically from last year, when he said at the UN General Assembly that shooting at US land with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said there was still much more to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea denuclearizes.
Trump said on Wednesday that he did not set a timeframe for this, saying, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
But U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Sanctions by the Security Council must continue to be strictly and without concessions until there is complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously backed sanctions against North Korea that have been in place since 2006, in an attempt to disable funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Rio past the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, so that North Korea would condemn him after only a few hours for making "gangster demands".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile range as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to get students more sleep in an effort to eradicate the increasingly popular macho culture of learning “all night with the help of caffeine.”
One academic noted that university students are the number one in the world often ignorant in terms of basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, has devised a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
The idea for this course came after a speech he gave about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“One girl finally came up to me and said, ‘Why am I only hearing this now, in my final year of study?’
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was – which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
In this course, which is being held for the first time this year, students are taught the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to better academic and sports performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, says the university decided to introduce this course after it was noticed that students suffered from a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a room in a dormitory and students should click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to hear more about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of sleep routines.
In the second part, participants listen to how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then the campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We are aware that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students.
But we believe they have the right to know – just as everyone has the right to know what the health consequences of smoking cigarettes are.”
The culture of pride in “all-night sleeplessness” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students have led to sleep deprivation becoming an increasing problem.
A sufficient amount of sleep, of high quality, should be the “secret weapon” of students in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against excess weight, since due to lack of sleep the brain goes into starvation mode, so they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his lectures last year during his first year at Harvard.
He says this course opened his eyes and encouraged him to advocate for its maintenance at the campus-wide level.
The next step, he hopes, would be to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar degree program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students think about setting alarms on time for sleep and waking up and take care of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm and thus lead to sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga defeated Gerard's team with a goal
Rangers experienced another downturn when Dolly Menga shot down Stephen Gerard's team in a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
The team from Ibrox Stadium sought to win their first away win after the February 4–1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerard's second loss as manager in 18 matches, leaving his team eight points behind the unattainable leaders of Harriet's Prembroke League.
Menga shot seven minutes before half-time, and the uninspired Rangers line-up never came close to equalizing.
While Rangers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs third behind Hibernian just because of the difference in goals.
Rangers may face additional problems after Line Judge Kalumu Spence had to show help due to a head wound after being shot from the side with some object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that skewed the Air and placed in the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, opted for the same eleven Livingston players who took the Harts last week and would have been thrilled at the way his well-trained team pressed opponents at every turn.
Rangers may have dominated the possession, but Livingston made better use of his time with the ball.
Little was missing to score just two minutes after Menga sent Scott Pittman into the empty space with his first dog, but the midfielder missed a big chance and scored next to the goal.
Kegan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett with a deep free kick, but his defensive partner Alan Litgow shot next to the goal at the second tripod.
Rangers managed to take control, but their game in the last line gave more hope than faith in themselves.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have received a penalty in the 15th minute when he and Steven Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's request.
Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox stadium goalkeeper Liam Kelly defended the head of Lasana Koulibali without any problems and tamed the shot directed by Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingstone's first goal in the 34th minute may not have reflected the right balance of power during the game, no one can deny that he was deserving of anything else, then due to the effort.
Rangers again couldn’t cope with Jacobs’ deep-playing action.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher dragged the ball to Slot Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted to the interruption by introducing Ryan Kent instead of Coulibaly and that replacement gave almost immediate results when the wing player hired Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to induce guests to play exactly as they liked, with the long balls of Litgow and Halket.
Holt's team had the opportunity to increase the advantage in the last minutes, but McGregor held well and defended the attack of Jacobs, then sent Litgou the ball by the head next to the goal.
Glen Middleton, the Rangers' replacement, at the end of the game was looking for another penalty when he hooked up with Jacobs, but Thomson did not react again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger devised a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
In addition to being one of the main strongholds of science, Geiger's counter also has its place in pop culture, as in the 1950 film The Corona Bell, starring the seemingly amazing cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
The man said, “What is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put those headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms with your ears thanks to the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Look, it’s really being heard!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Recognize Damaged Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to Recognize and Kill Distorted Cells
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize damaged cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their alteration in the laboratory
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many types of cancer, and then inject them again
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients suffering from various types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize damaged cells, ovarian cancer receded for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that occurs in many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that this is a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “encourages the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has been well proven in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West joined violent attacks in Trump's defense, wearing a cape bearing the MAGA designation, after a guest appearance on the SNL show.
It didn't go well
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an unrelated speech in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for political office in 2020.
After performing his third song that night, titled “Ghost Town,” with the caption “Make America Great,” he delivered a vehement speech against the Democrats and once again supported Trump.
“I’ve talked to white people so many times that they’d say, ‘How can you support Trump when he’s a racist?’
“If I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL aired a sketch with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual abuse.
Although not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock posted a recording of West's violent speech on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule West with this announcement.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was having trouble behind the scenes because of the helmet he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out with that hat."
They threatened me!
And then they say I sank,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
The news continued, "Do you want to see what it looks like?" adding that "I'm going to put on Superman's cloak because that means you can't give me orders. You want a better world?
Then spread the love."
The audience scolded him at least twice, and it seemed as if the SNL cast members were uncomfortable, Variety reported, while one of the attendees told the magazine: "The whole studio was in trouble."
The news at the last minute replaced singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, passed away a few days ago.
The news confused many with his performance of the song "I Love it", disguised in a bottle of Perrier water.
The news received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candice Turner, who posted the following tweet: "One of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR NOT INVOLVED BEFORE THE ABOMINATIONS."
However, TV host Karen Hunter wrote in a tweet that West was simply "its own and it's absolutely beautiful."
“But my choice is NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I believe accepts and loudly glorifies an ideology that is bad for my community.
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "sometimes known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name – he was preceded by Didi, also known as Puff Dedi, Puffi and Piff Didi.
Another rapper, Snoop Dog, formerly called Snoop Leone and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to a performer formerly known as Prince.

The Public Prosecutor's Office will consider the charges.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington condemns macho culture
Keith Harrington is known for his role as John Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones, which portrays a medieval fantasy full of violence.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the macho hero's stereotype, saying that because of such roles on the screen, young men often feel like they have to be rude to gain respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Keith voiced his view that "something went wrong" and addressed the issue of how to deal with the problem of the pernicious macho culture in the #JaIsto era.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones partner Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted he had a “strong need” to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m currently quite bothered by the question – what did we do wrong with the representation of masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach growing men about the problem we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for spreading the pernicious macho culture for portraying characters who portray themselves as male.
He added: “What is innate, and what is taught?
What is it that they teach us on TV and on the streets that makes young men think they have to fit into a certain mold of a man’s behavior?
I think that’s actually one of the main questions of our time – how do we change that?
Because obviously something went wrong with the young man.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not agree to the pre-sequels or sequels of the Game of Thrones series after it ended the following summer, saying that he was "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's play True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a bandit.
The actor recently revealed that he believes that getting acquainted with his current wife Rose is something of the best that the series “Game of Thrones” has brought him.
“In this series, I met my current wife, so it can be said that she gave me a future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose starred as Igrit, the love partner of Whale character John Snow, in this fantastic Emmy Award-winning series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people in the country have been infected.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the virus was transmitted through sex, which was not the case before.
HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China in the past as a result of transfusions of virus-infected blood.
However, the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sex is a burning problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality is no longer considered illegal in China since 1997, but they say discrimination against LGBT people is very widespread.
Studies estimate that, due to conservative perceptions in the country, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with men end up marrying women.
The transmission of the virus often occurs also due to inadequate sexual protection in such relationships.
In 2003, the Chinese government promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff published data on GOP senators, condemning “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters has denied allegations that one of her staff posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of those lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims were made by experts and websites of the ultra-right wing.
“Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mother Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was leaked by an unidentified person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The disclosure came at some point after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and published information about a member of her staff, Hill reported.
“This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security are compromised due to these false and inaccurate claims – is in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is a wholly false and absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online condemnation, which was also voiced by former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is exhilarating,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
We're not supposed to be bold.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He needs to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters' reaction to Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of acting too furiously at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“It’s a great thing if it’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said her office had informed "the appropriate competent institutions and judicial authorities of these false claims.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable before the law for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Review of “Johnny English – Back in Action” – a soft satirical spy film with Rowan Atkinson
It has already become a tradition to look for a subtext on Brexit in every new British-themed film, which can be applied to this sequel to the Johnny English satirical action comedy franchise – which began back in 2003 with the production of “Johnny English” and returned to life in 2011.
Will the ironic autosatisfaction about what an obvious rubbish we are be the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the sullen, incompetent Johnny English with a rubber-faced face has been given a new opportunity to mess up something – with his name more than anything else reminiscent of being a general comic creation designed for territories whose cinematic audiences are not English as their native language.
It is, of course, about a cunning undercover agent who, despite bizarre claims of the highest glamor, carries a bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's truffle and a crumb of that guy who played only one note as part of the thematic melody of the performance "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It was also originally based on the traveler and mysterious man in the international framework that Atkinson once starred in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving chaos behind.
In this latest sequel about Johnny English, there are also several scenes worth mentioning.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades briefly yelled at his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is obvious, but humor is rather lukewarm and unusually superficial, especially considering that "serious" film brands such as "007" and "Impossible Mission" now regularly include comic elements.
Humor leaves the impression that it was intended for children, not adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English's crazy accidents are not as inventive and elaborate to the point of tangents as Atkinson's silent-film-style gegs when he interpreted Bean.
Now it is a very topical topic that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of an agent on duty—unfortunately, small roles for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and combative character, who is already experiencing a complete collapse due to a decline in political popularity: Emma Thomson masterfully played this character modeled on Theresa May, but the script is quite poor.
Intelligence advisers are informing her that all active spies have been compromised and will have to hire one of the retired.
It’s the head-and-bearded Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some fancy institution, but unofficially teaches lessons on how to become a secret spy: there are some interesting gags when English provides an academy for spying in the spirit of the movie “School of Rock”.
English is rushed back to Whitehall for instructions and reunited with former patient assistant Bau, who is reinterpreted by Ben Miller.
Bau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, in the interpretation of Wiki Peperdin which is somewhat superfluous.
And so the wretched and incompetent Batman and Robin are back in action in Her Majesty's Secret Service and meet the beautiful femme fatale of Olga Kurilenko, Ofelia Buletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls into the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Walt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bau begin their odyssey of comic adventures: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a brilliant French restaurant, real chaos smuggling on Volta's luxury yacht, and English sets off a real anarchy in an attempt to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's house using headsets for virtuosity.
It is obvious that a great deal of effort has been invested in that last sequence, but no matter how sympathetic and cheerful, the entire film seems to be made for children.
Pretty average quality.
As with other films about John English, I cannot help but wonder: can the British film industry come up with a role for Rowan Atkinson that would justify his talent?
The Labour Party denies making a plan for the British to work four days a week and be paid for five days
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn is set to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week – and be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to give workers the time they save thanks to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would so enjoy a three-day weekend – but would still receive the same pay.
Sources say the idea would "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to improve working conditions and workers' rights.
The move to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: "It is expected that the end of the year will be announced by the reviewers.
"Change won't happen before nightfall, but it's not the end of the industry that's in the process of getting the party's approach to the settlement to the benefit of the stockholder, the stockholder, and the stockholder.
The Labour Party is not the first to accept such an idea, the Green Party has pleaded guilty to a four-day working week since the campaign for the general election in 2017.
However, such a longing is currently not made by the whole Labour Party.
The reporter of the Labour Party said: "The fourth working day is not part of the party's embrace and the party is not in control."
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party's participatory conferencing to expose his vision of a socialist revolution in the past.
Mr. McDonnell has made the same determination to restore power from the "free-directors" and "forefiters" in the public enterprise.
The plans of the minister in the shadows also make it possible for the current workers in the running companies to "advance" the current workers in the shadows, so that the current workers in the running companies may not be able to achieve their overall share of the labor force.
He also confirmed the plans for the company's 500-plus-dollar operations in the company's in-house operations and the creation of Inclusive Government Funds, which would have led to 10 inquiries.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy were talking about "60 Minutes" to see if they could reconsider the FBI investigation into the Cavanaugh case.
The F.B.I.'s investigation into the basis of the charges against the judge Bret on Cavanaugh's case has delayed the hiring for the last day of voting for his name on behalf of a member of the jury.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, a reporter on "60 Minutes" by Scott Pelli asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Grayham if they'd like to know about the FBI.
Kennedy was opened by his colleague from South Carolina.
"I think so," said Kennedy.
“I said it myself, going to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him about what happened when the charges were filed, and I said, "Did you do that?"
It was decided, decided, unambiguous."
However, it seems that Gray's voice is embedded in the stone.
"I've made my decision about Brett Cavanaugh and it wouldn't change it, not even the most explicit complaint," he said.
"I don't know what happened to Dr. Ford, but this is what I know: Brett has given up everything decisively," Graham added, thinking of Christine Blazey Ford.
“And no one who has mentioned it can confirm it.
It's been 36 years.
I wouldn’t say that anything is going to happen.”
What was the “Global Citizen” festival and did any of it contribute to the reduction of poverty?
This Saturday New York will be the home of the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a long and impressive list of performers and nothing less than an impressive mission.
On the seventh festival of the year 2030, the world's greatest citizen, and on the great day of the year, Central Park, will be remembered by hundreds of thousands of people, and we will not be able to enjoy the coming out of it.
The Festival of Global Citizenship, which was held for the first time in 2012, was a continuation of the Project on the Improvement of Global Poverty, an international group.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to pay for the VIP ticket or any other ticket), the ticket holders had to do a number of things for the event, including "action" like volunteering, sending them a ticket.
But how much of the Global Citizen's success has been achieved, given the 12 years that have been left to achieve the goal?
Is there a way to get people to ask for a call to an action, or is there another way to ask for a call to an action, or is there a way to ask for a call to an action?
Organizers of the Global Citizen claim that since 2011, more than 19 million shares of its supporters have been committed to achieving a number of distinct goals.
The claims that these actions have helped in 2030 that the world's leaders have put in place our goals, and we're building up to 37 billion dollars that would have impacted 2 billion people's lives.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had 390 goals set and announced the actions taken from it, for which it had already paid or collected a minimum of 10 billion dollars.
The group assesses that the collected media have had a direct impact on over 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key developments include the power to invest in the UK, the power to invest in the UK, the power to invest in the UK, and the power to invest in the UK, in order to “help children grow up in their full capacity”.
"With the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, it is now possible for us, the national governments, and the City of the world to do so in the form of unsustainable resources, that we can do so in the future.
The group also said it had more than 5,000 actions to take in order to improve the survival of the mothers and children, and that it would have been able to report to the authorities.
One of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which he says “why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied: “There will be a long and difficult road – there will be both failure and failure on it.
But as long as we've been sacked by a great human charge and as long as they've been able to counter the apartheida, we'll be able to do it, too, because we're stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bee and Janelle Monet are some of the performers who are appearing at this year's New York homecoming.
The U.S. could use the Navy to block Russian forces, according to the interior minister.
Washington may "require" to relocate to its own navy in order to prevent Russian forces from reaching the Middle East, including the Middle East, to the Middle East, to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U.S., to the U., to the U., and to the United States...
Zinki was told that he was engaged in Russia in Syria – where, in particular, he was interested in the call of the legitimate authorities – in the exploration of new energy markets.
"I think it's because of their presence in the Middle East that they want to sell their energy to the realms, you know, like they do in Eastern Europe and South Africa," he said.
And besides this caller, there's a way and a middle ground that can stop it.
"The United States has the power," with the help of our Navy, to secure the openness of the sea lanes, and then, if necessary, to block them, as we may.
Zinky spoke to the attendees at the organization's meeting about the energy manhunt, an unprofitable group that calls itself a "voice manhunt" in the energy manhunt.
He further refined Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, arguing that they were essentially the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia was, more or less, the exploitation and replacement of the power plant," he said, telling Russia that he was "once again who knows what he's eating."
These statements were made at the time of Trump's administration's attempt to bring out his precious natural gas in Europe by replacing Russia with Russia, which is what it is.
In order to achieve this goal, the officials of the Trump Administration, including the U.S. President Donald Trump himself, tried to assassinate Germany in order to "let it go."
Moscow has been in the top spot, and it's been reported that it's the North Pole 2, and it's estimated that it's worth $11 billion to double the capacity of the North Pole.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's hard-line response to this project has been inadvertently hampered by the economic downturns, and has been an example of an impractical competition.
"I believe that we're going to have to work with the Russian Ministry of Energy to use it as a means of exerting pressure and that the instigators need to have the capacity to fight back," he said.
The state of the U.S.A. has caused a negative reaction by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to this project.
The leading German industrial organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), called the U.S.A. not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral relations.
"I'm very disturbed by the meddling of the third party in our energy supply chain," said Dieter Kemf, president of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) at the time.
Elizabeth Warren will "think well" about the 2020 presidential election candidacy, according to a Massachusetts senator.
The Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "good think" about the candidacy for the president's term of office halfway through the term.
At the meeting with the city administration in Holjok, Massachusetts, Vorena confirmed that she would monitor the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and our dysfunctional government is on the middle, and that includes a woman at the top," she said, like Hill's newspaper.
"On November 6th, I will think well of a presidential candidacy."
In this meeting with the city administration, he criticized President Donald Trump, saying that “he is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracies," she said.
She was openly critical of Trump and his candidacy for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet from Friday, Warren wrote: "We're just about to need an FBI investigation into the polls."
However, the poll published on Thursday said that even in her own case, the vast majority of the voter's scourge would not be contemplating that Warren would need to do so.
Fifty-one of the "faithful" voices from Massachusetts said that the senator shouldn't be running for office, because the polls were taken by the Univ.
Thirty-two of them held such a candidature.
The survey received a major endorsement from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 votes in favor of the presidential candidacy and 48 votes in favor of the presidential nomination.
Another sonic name from the line of democracies that has been mentioned in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy year includes former co-chairman Joe Biden and a senna.
Biden said he was going to make an official decision in January, making the announcement before the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin changed the post-traumatic narrow route Trakai Palin to the rally of Donald Trump
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
On Monday, he was always brought in and charged with an incident of violence in the line of duty.
"That's what my son's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do, that's what he's going to do.
She was brought to him by another, and he described it to her as an example of a great problem that everyone ignored and said to his son and the other war winds: "They're coming back with a small one."
He was brought to you on Monday in your cell in Alaska, and charged with violence in the cell on the occasion of a woman's being found, a mention of the reported violence in the cell and a hand in hand.
18 Confederate States and the District of Columbia have held hearings on new asylum-provisioning protocols
There are a number of states and the District of Columbia that have taken a very serious examination of a new U.S.A.D. report that anticipates the repulsion of asylum-seeking victims who are fleeing.
Representatives of the 18 states and the Colombian district submitted a petition in Washington on Friday via a “friend of the court” to the asylum seeker who wants a copy of the case, NBC News reported.
He's got a full reporter complaining at Grace's parish, and the session he's been following in the name of a conscientious objector, the U.S. connection to the citizenry hasn't been unveiled.
She said that her partner "and her sons, members of the gang" were angry, but her officials from the United States rejected her request for asylum on June 20.
She's being held in Texas.
The state attorneys-at-law who are providing the right support to Grays have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, the land from which a large number of asylum seekers have been sent to the United States, including the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, to the United States, and to the United States.
The new U.S. asylum report was canceled in 2014 because of a decision that was made by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on behalf of immigrants, and which is undocumented immigrants.
A top law enforcement official in the District of Columbia, Carl Racine, said on Friday that the new transcript "ignored the children of the state, the state, the state, and the international."
“The law of law required that all decisions on all asylum-seeking grounds should be made on the basis of the concrete facts and conditions of those found in the law, and so on.
The Advokats continued to insist in the document that a copy of which the immigrants were hiding from the entrance would harm the U.S.A., saying that they were more likely to find that those former front-line contractors and "the
Supreme Court Justice Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer approve asylum-seeking victims who have been fleeing from indiscriminate violence and forced to flee.
"Asylum is available to those who have left their motherland on the 11th, or to those who have left their motherland on the 11th, or to those who are afraid of the foundations of the earth, the truth, the nation, the future.
The purpose of asylum was never the solution of all problems, not even of all serious problems, with which people all over the world face each other.
They are desperately trying to save themselves in Palu, and a number of the dead are doubling as they race to save the survivors.
Survivors were confronted with a more horrific situation.
"It's a lot," says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, dying of her young son, who is squeaking in an evacuation center in the desolate town of Palu.
"Emergency car in every minute to get to the body.
There's not enough clean water."
The officials have been seen returning to their devastated homes, picking up on the aftermath and trying to save everything they can do.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake have been overrun.
Some of the injured, including two Harrises, who had suffered with their backs and shoulders, were lying in front of a military hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated on the other side.
His eyes filled with tears told him how he felt as the earthquake shook violently the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save everything.
I think I’ve been pushed by the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city to celebrate the wedding.
“I heard my wife how she was getting along, and then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my kid.
I hope they're all right."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Guilty in Reproaching the Prophets”
On Sunday, the official Chinese newspaper published a report in a diary from the U.S.A., highlighting the sharpened benefits of trade between the U.S. and China, the U.S.A.
The U.S. President Donald Trump changed his name to the 6th day of the month, when he passed the billing of China Daily into the Dimoyne Register — the most recent list in the state of Iowa.
Trump's allegation that Pecking tried to interfere in the U.S. raids was what U.S. officials described to Reuters as a new phase in Washington's campaign.
Even though it's normal for foreign governments to declare war on trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in escalating war on trade in the middle of the war on trade.
China's early phase of the trade war's early tariffs were aimed at bringing in expatriates from the state along the way to Ajove, who held Trump's Republican side, the expert said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Ajove, who is a major exporter of semi-finished goods to China, said that Beijing had protected the U.S.
As Brunstad wrote in the column in a recent issue of the Dimoyne Register, China "is now additionally making us public with the proclamations of the past speeches in our own society."
"By expanding its reach, the Chinese government is using the precious American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of press, in announcing its payment to the United States," he said.
"On the other side, there's a kiosk on the other side of the street in Beijing," you'll follow a few opposing voices, and you won't see any real real outbursts of opposing mice.
He added that “one of the most prominent Chinese lists rejected the offer to publish” his article, but he did not know which list was the word.
Analysts say Republicans are estranged from women's voices in front of half of the mandate, because of a deal with Judge Kavanaugh.
As many of us at the top of the Republican Party have been holding, holding, and running for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanagh has been facing higher charges for sexual misconduct.
The emotions associated with this situation are exceptionally bright, and for most of the Republicans, they already know that they want to give him their voice.
Such a thing is impossible to pull off," said Grant Riecher, professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse in a sub-article in the Hill's list.
Richer has raised the suspicion that the insistence of Senator Jeff Flake (Arizona) on an FBI investigation in the last minute will be enough to appease the wounded.
"Women won't be able to do what happened next - they won't be able to do it tomorrow or in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, a senior researcher and researcher.
On Friday morning, the Demonstrators shouted "The New Year's Eve is coming!" as they marched into the Sennat's pilgrimage, after the Republicans, who were in control of the Indictment, were shouting "The New Year's Eve is coming!"
“Democrat enthusiasm and motivation will bring about an unforeseen circumstance,” said Stu Rottenberg, a non-native political activist.
“People say it’s already on a high level, that’s true.
But they can grow and continue to grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow, they can grow.
Even before the public testimony in which Ford's in-depth account of the sexual assault of a candidate for a member of the Supreme Court of the United States was given,
“This has become a huge mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, who did not speak to the NBC News.
"It is not a matter of a vote, or a vote, or a final vote, or a matter of whether or not he will be called to trial; it is also a matter of the manner in which the Republicans have come to terms here and there.
However, it seems that the American people have been diluted by the question of who they believe in the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, with a little more of those who follow.
The new survey that was conducted by the agency in question, or by the agency in question, indicates that 41 percent of the respondents believe in Ford's testimony definitively or plausibly, while 35 percent of them believe in Ford's testimony.
In addition, 38 of them said that they believed that he had lied faithfully or definitively in his testimony, while only 30 of them thought the same thing about Ford.
At Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, Gardian reported.
Ford didn't go under oath until he testified before the Senate Judiciary Board that he was invited to an alcoholic state where he was found when he was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that her candidacy for a member of the Supreme Court was due to her genitalia during a party that they attended at Yale's studio in the 1980s.
Inventing the World Wide Web Plans to Cover a New Internet to Compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startap project that aims to continue robbing Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of this historical legend, Inrupt, was a company built on the Berners-Lee Plateau of the open-ended Soli.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and who will be able to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company magazine, Berners-Lee found out that the intention behind the Inrupt project was "world domination".
"We have to do this now," he said to the old man.
"It's an historic moment."
The application uses the technology Solid to enable people to create their "personal space for the online storage of the company", or POD.
It can contain contact lists, back-end lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser.
What is unique about the personal background of the online storage facility is what is exclusive to the user depends on him or her accessing which information.
The company calls it "personally recreating through the data."
I'm going to Inrupt, as General Director John Bruce says, that the company is going to provide resources, resources, resources, and skills that can be used to help.
The company is currently based in Berners-Lee, Bruce, the company's stock exchanges purchased from the I.B.E.M., several of the company's regular stock exchanges.
Since then, I've been trying to find out more about how I can make real children's applications with the help of a tool available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team are not going to talk about "Facebook and Google about whether or not they're going to introduce a complete change that's going to happen to all of them after all.
“We don’t want to get away from them.”
On Saturday's announcement on the Medium platform, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt "has a mission to provide commercial energy and a single eco-satisfaction that will help and
Berners-Lee transformed an internal in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Institute of Technology in Massachusetts.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been one of the influential voices in the debate about the neutrality of the internal.
As the Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new age of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernhard Wann: Retreat to the priest of the First World War, the bearer of the Victorious Cross
The only priest of the Church of England to whom the Victoire's cross was granted as a fighter during the First World War, is still in his hometown of 100 years.
Lieutenant-colonel Grand Bernard Vanne served on this occasion on September 29, 1918, at the time of Belangliza and Leokura.
However, four days later, he was killed by a sniper and never knew he had the highest British military rank.
His two granddaughters discovered a plaque on a Saturday afternoon during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wan, said that it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been discovered for the past 100 years as an advance by his grandfather.
The London Gazette, September 29, 1918, and Lieutenant-Colonel Vanne led his father through the canal of Saint-Quentin "through a very dense mist, along the way
Then he rushed to the firing line and with the "nearest heroism" he led the way before he could find the artillery weapon on his own and kicked it out of the three of them.
Lieutenant-colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918—nothing more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Wan, 72 years old, said his grandfather's steps were "something I know I could never do, but something that challenges a lot."
He and his brother, Dr. James Wan, also had a wreath placed in front of the Imperial Youth Orchestra in Brentwood.
Michael Wan said that "it's still a great deal of fun for people to take part in the party" and added, "it's a very good hero's victory that's come to pass."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead got Pep Piglet
You'd think you'd stay awake all night to watch Bellator 206, and you'd be able to watch the main article.
The arrival at San Jose included 13 fights, including six in the main event, and in the UK, he was approached live at night on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., the same time that Geghard Musashi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face the situation, the viewers in the UK remained in danger when they arrived at Pepa Prepa Prepa.
Some of them were sober-minded that they stayed awake until the morning of tomorrow because of that fight.
One worshiper described a child’s drawing on Twitter as “a kind of sick scarf.”
"On the basis of the state's record, the contents at 6 a.m. were unattached, so they had to take care of the children," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president of the Federal Reserve.
"'Pepa Prase', yes."
The company's president, Whitewater Scott Cocker, said he'd be working on his own national scheme to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think as far as the story goes, I think we'll probably make it through," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning in the sun, and we won't be able to do that until after our time, after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the prenosa broke off, it was a lot of handcuffs, and they weren't all friends.
We were trying to get through it, we thought it was a technical commotion question.
But it wasn't, it was a problem for the state.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're gonna hold on to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're gonna try to get our hands on more than we usually do, and we're gonna just go over it.
The question is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Aylend Disc: Tom Daley felt "inferior" because of sexuality
Olympic snooker Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority in one way or another because of his sexuality—but that gave him motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old says that high school seniors didn't realize that "not everyone is like him."
In a talk on Radio 4 in the first issue of Desert Aylande's show with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to others to "make it happen".
He also said that he was less worried about winning the Olympics since he became a parent.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took it for several months in the absence of the disease.
Giving the impression of the rejected people in the first broadcast of Laverne, Daley said that he felt "less valuable" than the others when he was "not with her."
He said, "By today's day, that's the feeling that I'm getting better, and that's the feeling that I'm different, that were real things that gave me the strength and the strength to succeed."
He wanted it to be "something and something," he said, how he wouldn't reveal everything when the end of his sexuality came to light.
The two-time conqueror of the bronze medal of the Olympic Games has become a prominent fighter for LGBT rights and has used his approach to this year's IGRA Comonvelta in Austria.
He said that he made himself happy because he could live openly, without a trace, and because he wanted others to be "in the wrong."
A three-time world champion says he has "surprised" his love affair with a man, American director Dustin Lens Black, who he met in 2013.
Dale's been married to a man who's been dead for 20 years, but he says he's never had a problem in years.
"When you go through so much of it at the same age as you did in the early years" - the first Olympiad he left at 14 years old, and his father died three years later - as if he had been
The two of them became parents in June, they adopted the son of Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley told him that the "reader's perspective" had changed.
"If you'd asked me the last few years, it would have been 'I have to get a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
"Roby is my golden olympic honey."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 when he was discovered to have brain cancer.
Daley says his father didn't accept that he was going to die and that one of his last questions was whether he already had a ticket to the 2012 Olympics in London.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘Daddy, you’re not going to live to be in the first row,’” he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and when he stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The next year, Dale competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“One day I knew it was what I had been dreaming about all my life – that before I could get my audience home to the Olympics, it wouldn’t get any better,” he said.
That feeling inspired and his selection of the first song, "Proud" by Heather Smol, which he had discussed with him in preparation for the Olympics and from whom he had and continued to do so.
Desert Aylande broadcasts on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m. British summertime.
Michaelson on account of the drop from the plate was placed on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup
U.S. Phil Mickelson will keep a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he's gonna have to get back into the club to avoid a fight.
Mickleson, who for the last 12 years has been involved in this two-year-old dojo, Captain Jim Furrick sent to the bench for Saturday's game with four balls and a game in a row.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, like he's been in the United States so often, a five-time champion is going to lead the team as a fan, and he's going to lead the team as a fan.
Since even at the height of her career, she was not the most pre-eminent in her long-term marriages, this 48-year-old is not the ideal candidate for the narrow field of "Le Golf Nazionale,"
And if you don't have enough time for yourself in the next round, Michaelson's in his ninth game on Sunday in front of the champion of the British Grand Prix, Molina's in the French Grand Prix.
If the U.S. men, who are four in a row, commit 12 single-handed battles, they're going to have a hard-earned battle, Michaelson's sword could absolutely be pre-judged.
Furyck said he had faith in his man, and he couldn't say anything else.
“He fully understood the role he was playing today, he followed me to my back, he hugged me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furrick said.
“He has a lot of self-loathing.
His name is in the Hall of Fame, and he's done so much to these teams in the past, and they're not.
I probably didn't plan on him playing two games.
I was planning higher, but that's how it went down, and that's the path we've decided we should go.
He wanted to be there as much as anyone else."
Michaelson's going to challenge Nick Faldo's record for the most recent matches played in the Ryder Cup.
That could be the end of a career in a Ryder Cup that's never reached the height of his personal credentials.
Michaelson was 18 years old, 20 years old, and I'm still undecided, but Furrick says he didn't feel like he was on the team.
“He is sarcastic, sarcastic, witty, he likes to joke with people and it’s great to have him in the team headquarters,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed the opportunity to play it, and these are not the ones that were meant to be watched.
It's a lot more than the game itself."
European Capt. Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advance can never be made.
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that the sign of the day before the last day of the match at Ryder's cup may well have been in the making.
The date was in 1997 in the game at the Walders, where the side that led the All Ballesteros had the advantage of five men in the United States, but they were out of the country.
"I still think we've had a great deal of luck with Walders in the past five years; we've had a lot of luck with Brooklyn, where we've lost, and with Walders, where we've been.
Because history will tell both me and everyone on that team that there's no end to it.
We'll go full steam tomorrow.
Let's go out there and do everything you need to do.
There's nothing left until you've got something to do with you.
We have a goal, and that's to try and capture this trophy, and that's where the focus will remain.
I keep saying that, I focus on 12 players from our side, but we are also aware of what the opposite side is – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about playing his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never run in front of the ore for that matter.
Tomorrow is something completely different.
Tomorrow's the individual act of going to the stage, and that demanded a different game.
It's nice to be there with your partner when things are going as they should, but when you're there on your own, then your full golfer capacity will be tested.
It's a hand that you have to take to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he's just like he has to go out and get everything out of him."
On the count of Bjorn, Captain Jim Furrick's teammate Jim Furrick's teammate Jim Furrick's teammate Jim Furrick's teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates' teammates.
And Furyck himself was on both sides of those great upheavals in the last day, first as part of the winning team at Brooklyn, and then as a loser when the European team performed "The Miracle".
"I remember literally every word," he answered to questions like Ben Cranshaw, who had been inducted in 1999, had to raise his players while they were still waiting for him.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but it would be good if we had a quick start like the one you saw in Brooklyn and the one you saw in Medina.
When that guy's in the middle of a game, the pressure's on the middle of the game.
We're going to take our leave, and we're going to get what we think we need, you know, we're going to try to make a little bit of a tomorrow."
Tom<0xC3><0xA1>s did his best to try to get in front of Rory McIlroy in the final match, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Tona Roza.
"I'm headed with this group of my boys in that row because I think we're covering everything up," Björn said in a statement.
A new delay to a new German warship.
The last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates, the last of the frigates.
By the time Rynland-Falca, the lead ship of the new class of Fregat Baden-Württemberg, is due to arrive in the first half of 2019, he is receiving a list of the CITY CITY.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the problems of the evaporative armour have hampered the future of this ambitious project.
Four of the classes Baden-Württemberg commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the four-year-old frigates of the Bremen class.
It's known that he's going to be able to carry out a series of reconnaissance and reconnaissance rockets, as well as a number of other technical investigations, such as the alternating radar and radar infra-
Other important features include long-term work without maintenance – it should be possible for the latest frigates to lead up to two years in a row.
However, the constant delays mean that in the meantime, these warships will be in service – which should have been able to project their power to the sea – they will still be in service.
The F125's unfortunate frigate arrived in New York City last year when the German Navy refused to accept the flask and return it to the ship.
It was the first time that a Navy SEAL had returned a ship to the shipyard with some sort of evaporation.
We know a little bit about the reason for the return of the ship, but the German media wanted more crusades "defects on the sophomore and the harbour" that this warship would have done.
The company's failures were of paramount importance, as they would have caused the baden-württemberg class to invade the country from about 120 mornars - until half of humanity
Also, it turned out that the weight of the ship was drastically oversized, which would have diminished its perforations and limited the possibility of the Navy's late arrival.
It is believed that the Rhineland-Palatinate is 7,000 tons long, twice as long as the ships of the same class that the Germans used in the Second World War.
In the case of a phallic gardener, the price of the entire project—including the booklet of the site—was also the reason for the introduction of the problem.
I say that it has reached an estimated 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars) – out of the original 2.2 billion euros.
Problems with the most recent frigates are that they're clearly coming out in the light of recent advances in the suppression of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of staff for the German Parliament, confirmed to the Navy that "the ships were being brought up from the rear".
This clerk pointed out that, over time, the boats became more serious and more serious, because the boats were unloaded without the introduction of foreign vessels.
He expressed regrets that none of the frigates in Baden-Württemberg had been able to join the Navy.
National Fund Listens to Secret Lives of Blind Mice
The new investigations that have been carried out in one of the properties in Scotland are aimed at revealing how blind mice are using the geografske sleds in the pursuit of the goal.
The investigators hope that the findings will shed new light on the advances of these unique flying mammals and help guide future activity towards them.
The research of a scientist from the National Fondation for Scotland will provide common and vague blind muscles, as well as long-eared lilies and watered evenings in Inv.
Special devices for the recording will be placed on key locations across the property in order to maintain the activity of blind mice during the season.
The staff and volunteers of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) will also conduct mobile examinations by hand-held detectives.
A professional analysis of the sound from all the recordings will determine the frequencies of the voices of the blind mice and what kind of work they do.
Then there'll be a detailed map of the country with a report on how to get a picture of their performance on the field.
Rob Dewar, the conservation counselor, will come to the Fond and see if they can find out which areas of the site are the most important for the blind mice and who they are about.
These informations will help to reduce the number of other cases of forest management, such as the creation of the levada, as well as the way in which we can best manage forests.
The brutality of blind mice in Scotland and the wider UK was evidently reduced in the previous century.
They're threatening the city and town councils that are influencing the nesting and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting also present a risk, as well as sticky trails for flies and some types of chemical treatments for the city's mothers and daughters.
Blind mice in reality are not blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to capturing prey.
Relying on a sophisticated echo-locating technique to deduce the current position of the inspector and prevent him from going on his way over the summer.
The NTS Foundation, which is responsible for the care of over 270 cities from the Eastern signage, 38 important bastions and 76,000 hectars of land across the country, is very seriously
The foundation has a dozen trained specialists who routinely conduct research, inspect nesting sites, and then rescue operations.
This organization has even managed to establish the first and only military facility for the blind mice in Scotland, to have the Three in the area of Dumfries and Galway, which is home to us.
David Thompson's official name says that this property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Triva, we have a distinct streak for the blind mice," he says.
“We have old trees, we have old trees, and we have good stands in general.
But many things about blind mice are still unknown, so I'll work here and in other places to help them understand better what they need to know."
He's showing the importance of checking the presence of a blind mouse before carrying out a maintenance work in the estate's vault, because it's the accidental destruction of one of the nesting sites that may have been in place.
Blind mice are protected, and it's counterproductive to kill them, to mistreat or disturb and destroy their nesting grounds.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish clerk at the Foundation for the Protection of Blind Mice, encourages the public to get involved and to do their part.
She says, "And we still need to learn a lot about our blind mice, and for many of our species, we still don't know what it's like to be a virgin."
Ronaldo has denied charges of rape, and has called for a reopening of a lawsuit against a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to move themselves" using his name.
His adversaries were trying to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which announced the news to you.
The attacker of Juventus and Portugal was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
When he paid her $375,000 to avoid telling her about the incident, Speegle reported it on Friday.
Turning to 142 million of his supporters in Instagram Live, Ronaldo, 33, has reported that he dismissed them as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is false news,” said the five-time master of the Golden Balls in the chamber.
"I want you to help me by using my name.
That's normal.
I want to be famous for saying my name, but that's what happened.
I am a happy man and everything is in order," the footballer added with a smile.
The Ronaldo advocacy group is preparing to sue Spiegel over what they described as "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the region of attractiveness," Rojter said.
Advokat Christian Scherz said that the Fudbaler was going to be looking for a "moral damage in the rear of the road that's been breached, that's going to be breached."
The incident happened in June 2009 at the aparthman in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
On the night of the meeting at the night club, Ronaldo and Majorga returned to the player's room, where he was once again in an annal force, and the judge told him about the Occupy trial.
Majorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after another incident, claiming that he was "99 percent good guy" but that he let go because of those "one out".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was on a good basis.
Majorga claims that she went to the police with the "photographers" of her relatives who had been taken to the hospital, but that she later accepted the foreign court's advice because she "saved it."
This 34-year-old girl says she now wants to dismantle the situation because she's still traumatized by another incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the last round of relays to Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer, for 100 million euros, he went to Italy.
Brexit: UK “would never overtake” the loss of the automaker
The UK "would never have overcame" the loss of the status of world leader in the automobile, according to the minister's arrest of Greg Clarke.
He added that it was "a matter of concern" that Toyota UK had stated to the BBC that in the event that the UK would release the EU without an agreement on the temporary closure of the vehicle in question,
“We need a solution,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said it would help the border guards in the case of Brexit without a deal to prevent the loss of their jobs.
The factory in Barnaston – which is based on the Toyota Auris and Avensis – was built just over 150,000 cars in the past year, since which 90% has been exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that we’ll have a bootleg in the factory if Britain keeps the dead out of the EU,” says Marvin Cook, director of Toyota’s factory in Barnasto.
Other automakers in the UK, including Honda, Be-M-We and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fear of abandoning the EU without a deal on the functioning of the EU.
Be-M-We, for example, will say that after Brexit on the month of the day, it will shut down its factory of Mark Minnie in Oxford.
The main reasons for the concern are the risks associated with the supply chain in the case of Brexit without agreement, as the automakers say.
Toyotina's line-of-sale function is based on the "just in time" principle, where parts of the ordered cars arrive within 37 minutes of the UK and EU deliverers.
If the U.K. releases the EU without agreement on the 29th, it could come to the frontiers where industry leaders say it could come to the end and not the end.
Toyota couldn't have deposited an inventory for more than one day at his factory in Darbyshire, the company had cooperated, it'd have been bailed out.
Clark says that Theresa May's plan from Chequers is related to the future of the EU "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal we can make, as I would say, not just a moment's success, not even a moment's use of it.
"The testimonials are not from Toyota, not from him, and from the other riders, they say that we must absolutely be in a position to find out what's in it.
Toyota couldn't say how long it would take to lose a car, but he's going to be able to make a longer-term increase in the cost of the car and reduce the cost of the factory's competition.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working in Barnaston for 24 years and who is the functionary of the Union Union of Junite in the factory, said that his members are all more concerned: "It's my job, it's my job.
A spokesman for the government said: “We have conceived a precise and conclusive plan for our future with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstay could be remanded in custody, they say at the White House.
An important meeting of Donald Trump's at the time of his appointment with a deputy of the state legislature, Rod Rossenstayne, could be "detained for one more day" before he's gone.
Rosenstein is looking into the work of Special Counsel Robert Maler, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the outbreak, between Trump's assistant and Russia's, and possibly Russia's.
The question of whether Trump will replace the deputy of the supreme leader or not, and thereby jeopardize Maler's independence, has been a matter of months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been investigating the wiretapping of a wiretap for the recording of Trump's speech and the possibility of his own.
Rosenstein's turned that down.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, despite telling us he was ready to stay.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Mr. Trump said that he "wouldn't have done anything to change the situation, but then he was put on hold to escape the conspiracies of a court-martial.
Mr. Trump on Friday ordered a one-day FBI investigation into the charges against Mr. Cavanaugh, after delaying the voting of the entire Senate.
Trump's press office, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Channel on Sunday.
On another question about Rosenstein, she said, "It's still not fixed on the date, it could be that it's not, it could be delayed on another date, it could be that it's not, it could be delayed on another date, it could be that it's not.
But we see, and I always find myself stamping the blasphemous notices."
Some reporters might argue that Sanders, as of September 10, has not held a press release at the White House.
The director, Chris Wallace, asked about it.
Sanders's statement was that the succession of the suit was not a consequence of the defendant's desire to "attract attention", but she said, "I would not deny it if it were the case."
Then she announced that she was going to strengthen the direct contract between Trump and the newsman.
"The president has a higher conferencing in which he has answered the questions of any other president before him," she said, noting, "The president's got the answers to the questions of any other president before him."
And there will still be condolences, Sanders said, but "if the newsmen have the opportunity to directly remain inquiries to the president of the United States, that's not the case.
We're trying to do it all the time, and they've seen us do it in a lot of places, and they're gonna do it in a lot of places, and they're gonna do it in place of the station.
Trump is responding to inquiries on the occasion of a White House address or when he participates in open sessions or news conferences with visiting officials.
Self-conferences about the stamp are rare.
The presiding officer may not have been in New York yet, and that's why, since he was in front of the assembled newsmen, he was acting in an unwarranted manner, and on the other hand, he was bizarre.
The Minister of Health greeted the workers from the EU in the National Health Service of the Scottish Republic with the help of the fear of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote a letter from the EU working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express the gratitude of his country and to invite them to stay in the country.
Scotland's Parliamentary Envoy Jean Freeman sent a letter within a moment of her departure from the EU in less than six months of the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already made it clear that it will uncover a number of solved applications for a member of the European Union working in its responsible public services.
Fremanova wrote in her letter: “Speaking of the UK’s exit from the EU made it through the summer, following the expected decisions in the autumn.
But the U.K. government is also working to prepare for a possible scenario without reaching a consensus.
I know this is certainly a disturbing time for all of you.
So now I want to tell you how much I want to do for every member of the public, without regard to nationality.
From the various activities of the European Union, and beyond, we now have the valuable experience and skills to develop and improve the health service, as well as the use of the company and the company.
"Scotland is undoubtedly your home, and we'd very much like you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is an urgently operated man who has suffered a head injury.
Lainebacker Teensy's state of Tygers, Christian Abercrombie's, was urgently operated by a man who suffered head-to-head in Saturday's service with the result of 31-27 October.
The head coach of Tennessee State, Rod Reed, told reporters that something had come up before half-time.
“He came out of the line and there he was just collaborating,” Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen in the car before they put him in the sack and took him out for further testing.
A Tennessee State clerk told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was taken to the Vanderbilt Medical Center to be operated.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type/seriousness of the case" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when it came to the case.
Abercrombie, a second-year red jersey, is currently in the first season with Tennessee State after the Ilinois trance.
On Saturday, he had five shots before he launched the game, which combined a number of shots in the season until he was 18.
Strangers will be more likely to get paid than the taxable mark on the occasion of the purchase of a property in the UK
To foreign buyers, there will be more than one tax stamp on the occasion of the purchase of the property in the UK, and the incoming revenue will be used for the help of the homeless in the school with the rest of us.
This way, the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voices will be neutralized.
Additions from the tax stamps will apply to those who don't pay through to the UK.
The Treasury expects the year to be raised up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million to help the homeless.
Stranger buyers will be more likely to get paid than the taxable marks on the occasion of the purchase of the UK property – and the incoming revenue will be used for the help of the homeless, Theresa May will not be able to afford it.
This is because they're going to try and neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in the process of attracting young voters by promising to give them access to the news.
Addition of the exact mark will be applied to the physical and physical persons who do not pay by way of the UK, and the subsequent newcomer will be used for the purpose of doing so.
A further offer – which will be added to the three-way ticket, including and already out of the two-year-old's house and the purchase will be canceled.
The trustee expects that, due to the time of the year, up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million will be collected.
It's estimated that 13 years ago in London, non-residents of the U.K. are being bought, which raises prices and makes it harder for people to buy first before they come to the mainland.
Many of the wealthy parts of the earth--notably the ring--became "ghost cities" because of a large number of foreign buyers who spent most of their time on the earth.
A new transcript is coming in just a few minutes after Boris Johnson called for a change in the tax stamps that would help young people get in the first place.
He accused the big city firms of "holding high prices on the land as they take it away, but not using it, and he appealed to Prime Minister May to dismiss the quotas for access."
Corbyn has announced a compelling series of long-standing tenures, including the control of rentals and the end of unresolved evictions.
He also wants us to get more authority to build our new homes.
Prime Minister May said: “Last year, I told myself that I would dedicate my premiership to the rebirth of the British dream – that life would be better for each woman’s life.
And that's what we're talking about, and we're talking about solutions to problems in our barn market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it cannot be too early for the purchase of an immovable property to come at the same time as an individual who does not live in the UK and abroad, as well as for other British cities.
For many people, the dream of staying at home was too far away, while the humiliation of poverty remained too real."
Jack Ross: “My ambition is to lead Scotland.”
Chief Sanderland Jack Ross says his "end of ambition" is that in a moment he'll be the manager of Scotland's re-enactment.
Forty-two-year-old Scott enjoys the challenge of reviving the club with the Northeast, which is currently in third place in the first league, three points from the top.
This summer, it moved to the Stadium of Lights after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a footballer.
I was in the B-team, and that's it," Ross told the BBC's Sportsound.
"But I grew old by looking at Scotland at Hempden with my father when I was little, and that was something I'd always come back to.
However, such an opportunity would be provided only if I was successful in running the club."
Rossi's reps as Sanderland's managers include Dick Advokat, David Moyiz, Sam Allardajs, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gasa Poijet and Pao Diaz.
The former boss of Aloe Atletico said he wasn't afraid because he'd come down with such a big name in such a big club, like he'd turned down the offer from Barnsley and Ipswich.
"Meryl's success in this moment will be in the 'whether I can make it back to this club in the Premier League'.
To the structure and capabilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
"There's no easy way to get him there, but I think I'll be able to look after myself successfully if I can get the club back to where it belongs."
Ross is in the third year of his career as a career manager, a period who was hired as an assistant to a boss in Dhambarton and 15 months of training.
Then he helped Aloe get in the third division, and St. Mirren went from the edge of the league to the bottom of the league to the winner of the championship next day.
Ross says there's been a year-old feeling like it was at the time of the acting careers in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren, and Hamilton academics.
“It was probably a real cross,” he said, recalling the takeover of Aloe Club.
"I actually believed that the man was the real deal for me, more than just playing.
It sounds strange, because I wasn't bad, I've done a solid job of it, and I've enjoyed some solid successes.
But the game is going to be tough.
He's got a lot of things going on that you have to take to the next level.
And I'm still going through it in terms of stress and pressure after, but my manager's only been able to help me out.
I've always wanted to change my mind, and now I'm doing it, and in my entire life, I haven't felt like it in a day."

Finished time for the mug is 5:30 p.m. Saturday, research reveals
The summer heat wave increased the number of British troops fighting for the opposition, but it increased the pressure on the chain of command.
In the group of brothers and sisters there was an increase of 2.7 percent in July – but the number in the restorans fell by 4.8 percent, as the figures suggest.
Peter Martin of the Consultant Company of the CGA, who has been working on the figures, said: “It is still sunny time and he is expected to attend the English language in the first place in the world.
At the rate of 1.8 percent in June in the rest of the world, he continued to grow in jule.
Boys and boys focused on drinks had the best thing to do with more growth in the end of the day to get the results out of the previous riot, not what was in it.
The kids who were focused on food were also starving because of the sun, but not as dramatic as the owners of the restaurant.
Seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
The chains of the babs and the babs were selling their drinks for 6.6 percent a month, and their food for three percent a month."
Paul Newman of the RSM agency, in analysing the reasons and hospitality, said: “Such results are a trend that we have seen since the end of April.
Timely opportunities and influences of the main social and sporting events and still are the main factors when it comes to selling to the market outside the household.
It's not a surprise that the groups that have been set up are putting up a heavy fight, even though they're going to be down from 4.8 percent on the yearly level, and they're going to be a bit of a pain in the ass when they're already there.
It's been a long hot summer, and it can't get there in the hottest time to get the focus on the food, and the time will tell if the temperatures that we're supposed to have are going to be moderated.

Every fifth child—from whom they have been 11 years old—does work on the social networks he hides from the adults.
The investigations that have been carried out by 20,000 high school students have uncovered a great deal of "false insta" - that is, they are now on the site for the work of the university.

Ailey Doyle will be the “voice of the athlete” in the Scottish Athletic Council
Ailey Doyle was elected a member of the Scottish Athletic Board as the non-executive director of the annual General Meeting of this prestigious body.
Doyle is the most appreciative Scottish athlete ever, and Ian Beatty has described this as a great opportunity for those in the water to gain a foothold from him.
"Ali enjoys a great deal of the athletic community in Scotland, the UK and the wider world and we are sure that the athletics in Scotland will have enormous benefits from it."
Doyle said, "I want to be the voice of an athlete and I'll find that I can really give doprinos and help lead the sport in Scotland."

I'm saying to the pump that the milk is being pumped out of the mother's house, and the cows are sharing their opinions on the inside.
The company that built the pump to dispense with the musings shared the opinions of the inner sayings that were coming from the musings of the cows.
In order to secure the launch of the project, the company was described as "the first insensible pump to be pumped under the breast," the company's contractor said in a statement.
Four real mothers dance in the room between the shadows and the cows with a song whose lyrics read: "Yes, I do, but I don't have a rap" and "Maybe you haven't noticed, but it's not me."
Refrain said, "Pump, pump, feed my baby, pump, pump, I'll take care of myself."
However, statements made to a Facebook company page have caused a counter-internet attack.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of commensurate views, the video caused a variety of reactions from viewers, while many said it contained the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“The use of the cow for the recitation of this line was a very bad decision.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and do their best to produce milk, but they're going to have their babies for a few days after they're born," he wrote.

Another commented: “It is clear that it is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why wouldn't they use the pumps for the mothers that I can keep my babies?"
He added, "You're an inconsiderate saying."
Others stood on the sidelines of the chanting, and one woman confessed that her song was "hurrahable."
“I think it’s a genius.
I'd like to keep this one coming.
Because of the pumping, I feel like you're a cow.
The chanting was a sham, but I got it right.
It's a genius piece of work," he wrote.
Another commented: “This is a funny saying directed at moms who are mumbling milk (sometimes in a different place or in the bathroom) and they’re feeling like they’re in a different place.
This isn't about who caught it or where the dairy industry is."
Toward the end of the video, a group of women discover that they are dancing with discrete pumps hidden in their bras.
The concept of a saying is based on the knowledge that many mothers who whine their milk say they feel like cows.
However, Elvie's pump is completely inhospitable, she doesn't have the wires or pipes and she's stuck in the chest for what's going on, what's giving women the freedom to cry, they're keeping their babies, they're keeping theirs, they're keeping theirs, they're keeping theirs.
Anna Balarin, partner and executive creative director at Mother Company, commented: “Elvie’s pump is so much a revolutionary vehicle to serve as a bold and courageous leader.
By drawing the parallel between the maturation in women and the nursing cow, we wanted to highlight the maturation and the challenges it brings with it, as well as to present an amazing sense of freedom that the new pump provides in a way that is fun and with which women can connect.
This is not the first time that Elvie’s pump has reached the headline of the press.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Moved to Temporary Camp on Texas Border
The number of migrant children detained has increased significantly, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the harsh rhetoric and policies the Trump administration has imposed to make it more difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
As usual, the sponsors were mostly undocumented illegal immigrants themselves and fear that they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country if they stepped forward and sought a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints, as well as that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs police official, confirmed last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor minors without care.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“About 80 percent of people who were sponsors or members of sponsor households are illegally in the country, and a large part of them are criminally prosecuted foreigners.
That's why we're still chasing these people," Mr. Albens said.
According to the shelter workers, in order to speed up the processing of children, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than within 60 days, which was the previous standard.
The majority will use a conference video instead of a personal presence to apply for legal status to an immigration judge.
Those who are found not to meet the conditions for release will be deported as soon as possible.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports from the system in previous months.
Advocates say concerns about this have been raised in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that the child is struggling can be easily overlooked due to its size.
They add that moving children to a temporary settlement without leaving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends can cause traumas that many are already struggling with.
Syria urges US, French and Turkish “occupying forces” to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in their country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and would be “treated accordingly.”
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he said before the assembly.
Muallem said the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions have left their homeland.
He also said Damascus would continue to “fight its holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “the entire illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly trained and advised by both Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-torn country.
Regarding the refugee issue, Muallem said there were satisfactory conditions for them to return and accused "certain Western countries" of "spreading an irrational fear" of refugees staying out of the country.
"We have sent an invitation to the international community and humanitarian organizations to help their return," he said.
“They’re making policy out of something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a vacuum zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has led to the creation of opportunities for further development of political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement drew attention from large-scale attacks by Syrian forces, which enjoy Russian support in the province of three million people.
Muallem, however, stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the aim of the military actions will be jihadists together with fighters from the Nusra Front, associated with al-Qaeda, who will "be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon coincide with the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition with the aim of drafting a post-war constitution that would allow Syria to hold elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the panel’s work should be limited to reviewing articles of the current constitution,” and warned of interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump could win a re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are likely to hope, the accusations and scandals end his reign before that.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic final episode of a presidential career in history!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Percussion viewers have more than doubled since 2014 to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled from 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewership of 2.4 million viewers in percussion, more than the 1.7 million they had four years ago, according to Nielsen, while MSNBC’s “Rachel Meadow Show” ranks first on cable TV with as many as 3.5 million viewers on the most important news days.
“It’s an element that people get dragged into because it’s something we don’t understand,” says Neil Behr, chief producer of ABC’s “The Actor of Duty” series, which tells of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol’s destruction in the attack.
Nell Skowel, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Fun Parts: And a Few Painful Truths About Hollywood Behind the Scenes, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked him why.
Miss Scovel says he replied, "Because he makes me laugh."
Chaos in itself contains the value of entertainment.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the plots coming from Washington can determine the future of women’s right to choose abortion, whether immigrant families will be able to unite and the state of the global economy.
Turning off the program is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes a little beyond the status of an informed citizen when you catch yourself as a six-hour expert panel discusses how Bob Woodward in his book “Fear” places information as facts, about a pilot jacket made of Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather of $15,000 (“a piece set with pride” and “a post”).
As far as I'm concerned, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“One part of his behavior that makes everything seem like a reality show is that he offers us content every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of Stars of Pledges, on the subject of character shifts and the daily plots of the show’s Trump show program.
You should not allow yourself to miss any episodes, otherwise you are lagging behind.

He couldn’t get away from the screen, not while Brett Kavanaugh faces the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hangs in the balance.
“I remember that at the time, when we were doing all those crazy series, people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” says Mr. Fleiss.
“I thought they were joking, but I think they were right.”

The influx of foreign money in the middle of a tense race for early elections in the presidential house
Not surprisingly, the 17th congressional district of Pennsylvania receives inflows of money, thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts, which cause two deputies to fight for the same seat.
That’s how Conor Lamb, a Democrat in Pittsburgh’s suburban district, got a seat in the second district in a special election last spring, fell out recently.
Lamb is in a race with another lawmaker, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The maps were drawn again after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts had unconstitutionally rigged the election results in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th kicked off a competition to fund campaigns between the party’s biggest financiers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb was known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely followed March special elections for the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania.
The seat was held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the election for 20 points.
Politicians have given Trump a good advantage.
U.S. Considers El Salvador Penalized for Supporting China, So Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, Trump held a cordial meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela and owned a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic envoys from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore,” said Heather Noert, a State Department spokeswoman, earlier this month.
However, the penalties applied only to El Salvador, which in 2017 received US aid worth an estimated $140 million, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
Penal measures imposed, which include cutting financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hardly fall on a Central American state that already has a high rate of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings continued, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic progress to accompany a similar gathering last year that they saw as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading toward the United States.
But by mid-September, top administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and put an end to all questions about El Salvador’s penalties.
Vice President Mike Pence will be addressing the conference, whose new term is mid-October, indicating the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, according to diplomats.
And so the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punitive measures from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to speak on internal matters on condition of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst close to the administration, also anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable thing is likely to be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, as there is already substantial evidence in public sources.
Mueller is also reportedly launching an investigation into whether Trump’s campaign was colluded with Russia over the election attacks.
If the administration of Congress were to shift into other hands, Trump would face responsibility in that body, as he prepares to re-enter voters and possibly colleagues in court.
That’s a lot of unconfirmed possibilities, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s defeat is inevitable – nor the defeat of his equivalents in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, need to make decisions that will determine how long the difficulties will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a coup against Hitler, that the West was able to resist him and deter the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not succeed in this, and we missed the opportunity to avoid the slaughter that followed in the following years.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who governs the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has found himself in a pickle since the newspaper reported last year that he proposed that the president secretly film himself and comment on his ineligibility for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' statement is incorrect.
“How do we react when Bret Kavanagh’s newly launched investigation at the FBI is neither complete nor fair, or if he gets approval from the Supreme Court, despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in an early election for a Congress that Mr. Trump considers reliable?
If we fail these exams, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I believe that we will not fail thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial residence.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light a Saturday candle on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorans of Rangers optimistic before meeting with Rapid Vienne
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, aware that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive equal result with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would bring them a solid position for qualifying from the Group G of the Europa League.
Graham Doran, a midfielder, could not appear in the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal due to a knee injury, but believes the Rangers can use that score as a springboard for larger goals.
“It’s a good point for us because Villarreal is in a better position,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game with the belief that we could get something, and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could get them in the end, but taking everything into account, the equal result is quite fair.
They were probably better than us in the first half, but we went back in the second half and took the lead.
Thursday is approaching and it will be another great evening for Europe.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a great result from the last game. Although, with the audience on our side, I am sure that we can climb and get a positive result.
The past year has been very difficult, with everything that has happened to me with injuries and changes in the club itself, but the current position is satisfactory.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy, the training is good.
We hope to be able to catch up now, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women Worried About Retirement Savings
Despite the fact that the participants in the study clearly knew what kind of care they wanted to get, very few of them talked about it with their families.
About half of those surveyed in the Nationwide study said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them say they’ve talked to their kids about it.
“People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don’t take steps to talk about it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance group Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t introduce them to your desires enough in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, decide where and how you want to receive care, as these are choices that greatly affect the costs.
Turn on a financial advisor: he can help you find a way to cover those costs.
Your long-term care financial decisions may include common long-term care insurance policies, a hybrid life insurance policy that involves money and value to cover costs, or self-insurance from your own assets as long as you have money.
Arrange your legal documentation: warn litigation.
Get a health care assistant to have a reliable person you can entrust to keep an account of medical care and that health care professionals are familiar with your wishes in case you are unable to make your own statement.
Also, consider giving authority to manage finances.
You should choose a reliable person who will make financial decisions for you and take care that the bills are paid on time if you are not able to do so.
Do not forget about the details: Imagine that your aging parent comes into a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you give answers to questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in writing to be prepared.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about questions like who the doctors are,” Martina asks.
“Which medications do you use?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan for all of this.”
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he returned home from the exit.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in a part of Ilfracombe in Devon called Oxford Grove, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 2:30 a.m. British summer time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police have asked witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have lost their lives in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, with the death toll expected to rise, according to official sources.
Because of the disconnected links, emergency relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dongale Regency, an area north of Palu that was closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are the most important facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 from 2017.
At the time of the earthquake and tsunami, the city was in the middle of celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency stretching over 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline of the island of Sulawesi.
Regency, an administrative region lower than the province, had an estimated half-life of 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of the province of North Sulawesi relies heavily on fishing and livestock farming, especially in the coastal region of Dongale.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in the area of Morovali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulevasi.
Palu and Dongala have experienced more tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency.
In the 1938 Dongala tsunami, more than 200 people lost their lives and thousands of homes were destroyed.
Tsunami struck West Dongala again in 1996 when it claimed nine victims.
Indonesia lies on the seismic fire belt of the Pacific Ocean and is a regular target of earthquakes.
These are the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that struck the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries and claimed 226,000 lives along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half the population of Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people lost their lives on the island of Nias opposite the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of the province of Zaparna Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of as much as 10 meters in which dozens of villages were destroyed and about 300 lives lost.
2016: A minor earthquake struck the Pidjaya Regency in Atcheh, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the destruction caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the collapsed buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Trek Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of harassment.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Vassilja, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, as well as reports of domestic violence and resistance to arrest.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police and report alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Palin was detained in Mats and given a $500 bail, KTUU reports.
On Saturday, he appeared in court where he said he was "certainly not guilty" when asked, the network reported.
Palin faces three class A violations, which means he could receive a one-year prison sentence and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offences, which are punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time a criminal complaint has been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently on trial for veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of criminal reporting and possession of alcohol-related weapons.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face with his fist.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by the Iraq war.
Tsunami Caused by Indonesia Earthquake: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck only central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek death sentence for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment not carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a Home Depot rental truck to attack a bike lane along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October and mow pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted severe bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in New York's southern district.
According to the court document, both cars carry a possible death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal grand jury filed 22 indictments against Saipov, which included eight racketeering murder charges, typically used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried it out as “detestable, cruel and corrupt.”
Saifulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, En-Laur Dicat, Derena Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernana Ferucci, Hernana Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Panucho.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last prosecuted the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were sentenced to death on the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who was originally from Uzbekistan, did not repent in the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
The indictment alleges that Saipov told authorities that he was prompted to carry out the attack by ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said they had also asked for the flag of ISIS to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Petton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “apparently disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a confession of guilt with life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” said Peton.
Saip's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative party's parliament says that the most Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a Conservative Party conference, vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former UKIP leader said politicians should face Euroscepticism – as one of the MPs, Theresa May, suggested, he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back MP Peter Bone told a rally in Birmingham that the UK would have "already come out" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary.
However, the challenge Mrs May faces in reconciling her divided ranks has been accentuated by the conservatives’ stances on staying and joining a separate city-wide protest against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to follow Chequers’ compromise plan amid attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of the remainder and the EU.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the reaction – and force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between its offer and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone stated at the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should become equal and be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If I were responsible, we’d be out by now,” he said.
A member of parliament from Wellingborough added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers."
Emphasizing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their minds and wanted to stay is completely false.”
Andrea Jenkins, a Conservative MP and Brexit supporter, also attended the protest and told reporters: “I’m just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for him, it is not popular with our party and our activists who actually take to the streets and put us first.
Let Chequers go and start listening."
In a message addressed to Mrs May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their place when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage told the crowd that politicians must face problems if they decide to issue a decision that was made in a 2016 referendum.
“This is now a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them get away with it.”
In an address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on its way to betray Brexit, to feel the coming tide.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that won Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the remainder walked through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Many activists waved banners of “Conservatives vs. Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a Labour leader, scoffed at the Conservatives over the security issues they had with the party's application since the conference was open.
“These are people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology for a Canada plus plus solution, for a friction-free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.”
Good Brexit, it does not exist," he added.
Vorenova plans to carefully consider entering the race for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "well consider entering the race for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Jeff Deal, a Republican who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They speculate that Warren could replace Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city council since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to recover the shaken government, and that implies a woman at the top.”
Suspect arrested who shot Sims, an LSU player
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect who shot and killed LSU basketball player Wade Sims had been arrested.
Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old, at 11:00 ET at a conference.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Simms, 20, was killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and died instantly,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told reporters via 247sports.
Wade stood up for his friend and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon, and killing Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
A junior 198.12 cm tall who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games with 10 starts in the last season and an average time of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team would play a major role in this race.
From a pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two laps and called on Vettel to attack his colleague.
Vettel first went to boxing and left Hamilton to rush into the crowd at the end of the tape, which was supposed to be decisive.
Mercedes set out later and came out ahead of Vettel, but Hamilton overtook the wheel after driving alongside the wheel, which inadvertently left Ferrari's driver in danger of retreating after a double defence move on the third turn.
Max Ferstappen started from the back row and reached seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led in most of the race to reach a quick finish and take Kimi Raikonena fourth place.
He went to boxing in the 44th round, but could not increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, so Raikonen remained in fourth place.
This is a tough day because Walter was driving great all weekend and like a real gentleman he missed me.
The team did a great job winning the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump sneered at Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her claim that she did not release a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "evil, rude and dishonest."
“The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, vicious, rude and insincere,” he said.
“When you look at the posts and the leaks, and they say, ‘Oh, that’s not what I did.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you release that to the public?
Remember her response... did you release the document to the public – “Oh, please, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not."
Well, wait a minute.
Did we publish it... No, we did not," he added, speaking about the senator.
In July, Feinstein received a letter from Ford detailing allegations against Kavanaugh, and the letter leaked to the public in September. Feinstein dismissed the claim that the information had leaked from her office.
“I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t publish her story,” she told the board.
“She asked me to keep the story confidential and I kept it as confidential as she asked.”
But her denial didn’t seem to appeal to the president, who commented during a meeting on Saturday evening: “You know what, it was a very bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president said the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They have decided to restore power by any means.
You see evil, disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars made amends for losing to the Elite League on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning a 5–3 rematch in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought home the advantage before Dwyer regained the leadership of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lucas Landvod Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, and the Giants have won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's opener arrived in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, alongside David Rutherford, who provided the assist after Bowley doubled the lead four minutes later.
At the time of the busy opening, Sullivan regained the advantage of playing on home court at 13:10 before Matt Marquis assisted the draw by Kauni at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead in the first third when he scored a second goal at the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard scored an excellent goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran helped Nilsena secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured his team's victory in the fifth half.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to save hundreds of people on plane from earthquake
Indonesia’s air traffic controller has been named a hero after enabling a plane carrying hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong blows continue to shake the area and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Despite his colleagues being evacuated, 21-year-old Antonis Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that collapsed at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in the city of Palu.
He remained to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower when he saw the tower fall.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sire said the decision made by Antonis may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Pal.
“Our hearts are broken because of it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the National Disaster Management Agency said access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong was limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims continues to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot be reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purvo Nagroho, said.
Waves reaching up to six meters destroyed Palu, which will host a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Emergency care is brought by bodies every moment.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere."
Jan Gelfend, director of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
It’s a tragedy, but it can be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal on Sunday and told the state military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all rescue tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lambok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Air Niugini says one person missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that operated the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia said one person was missing after it said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it had not been able to find a single passenger, a man, since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down passengers.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger such as age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuk.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were detained at the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
It remains unclear what caused the decline and the exact order of events.
The airline and the Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying low.
"It's an extremely good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and others managed to break through the water to the waist to the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working nearby on port repairs also helped rescue the ship by using an inflatable boat to transport people to the coast before the plane sank about 30 meters underwater.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in the crashes of airlines registered in PNG over the past two decades, but none of them were Air Niugini.
An analyst shows the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor’s office completed the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Raoult testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told the jury he used cell phone records to merge the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Thelis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Roulet said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Telis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contrary to his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with a cell phone that belonged to Chabers for a period of time when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford came to testify on Saturday and stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because the truck was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Telis said he knew Chambers two weeks before her death.
Cell phone records show that they only knew each other for seven days.
Roulet said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted her messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is due to deliver its final statement on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to continue that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop that raises awareness?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative image of this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots – political messages and social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and restore the popularity of socio-political hip hop.
Artists such as Fujiz and Comon have again become current in the UK thanks to performers such as Akala and Lowki.
Another black man?
New York nanny sues couple for dismissal after 'racist' message
A New York City nanny sued a couple for discrimination and dismissal after receiving a text message from her mother in which the mother complained that the nanny was "another black person".
The couple denies being racist and equates the lawsuit with “extortion.”
Linzi Plasko-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed dissatisfaction when she learned that the new babysitter, Giselle Morris, was a black woman when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE ANOTHER BLACK PERSON,” Ms. Plasko-Flexman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
When she realized the mistake, Plasco-Flexman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their current nanny, who is an African-American, was not doing a good job and that she was expecting the Philippines instead.
Mrs. Morris was paid a day's work, and then Uber was invited to take her home.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for their dismissal and is seeking compensation of $350 per day for a six-month job she was originally supposed to do living in their home, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t do such things,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s about discrimination.”
The couple dismissed claims that they were racists and said the termination of Morris' employment was a reasonable move because they feared they would not be able to trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent me something she didn’t plan on saying.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist." husband Joel Plasco told Post magazine.
“But why would you give your children to someone you were rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on, please.”
Equating the lawsuit with “extortion,” Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to attack someone in that state?
That's not very nice," the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly renounced the couple on social media and condemned them for their behavior and logic.
In the newly discovered letter, we learn that the Paddington book publishers were afraid that readers would not tie themselves to the bear that tells the story.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jenkel, who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading it for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before a small teddy bear inspired him to write this children's book, would have been optimistic even if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "at the same time bitter and sweet" after his death.
For Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," she said her father was discreetly proud of his final success.
“He was that man and he didn’t brag,” she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, he felt like people had a child who had accomplished something: they were proud of him even though they hadn’t actually done anything.
I think Paddington's success was something like that.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he always attributed all the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was quickly transported to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Ned called regularly to say that the condition was very bad, that he didn’t expect to survive,” said Ednane-Laperus.
“Then I received a call from Ned telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The effect of the drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating stopped slowly and the drugs left her system.
She died some time before that, and this was actually the shutdown of the entire system.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to hold on.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednane-Laperus, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what kind of hell she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shook my head and tears flowed down my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but over the summer I felt immense compassion for Ned.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning set up suicide prevention cards on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide work to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on a Welsh bridge place cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I have to feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a cook with great potential and an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile brightened the room.”
However, he gave up his job before his death because “everything was darkened.”
After taking his own life in 2014, he was found by a brother who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly worried that there will be consequences.”
Mrs. Davis made the cards “to make people aware that there are people you can reach out to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent – you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davis for years, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day – when the children opened the presents, he didn’t look them in the eyes or anything.”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to deal with it: “It leads to discord in the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs over as the FBI launches an investigation
“I thought that if we really got something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time and limited-range investigation — maybe we could come to some sort of agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “disintegrate” amid tight party pressure.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their opposition came about because of the timing.
We are only five weeks away from the midterm elections, which take place on November 6 – if, as expected, the Republicans do badly, they will be significantly weakened in their attempts to bring the man they want to be elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush constantly invites the Senators and lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI releases its report?
There will be a Senate vote, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democratics.
It is still uncertain whether Mr. Cavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to reverse the decision and send him to the Supreme Court.
The number of deserters in North Korea "fallen" under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean defectors fleeing to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Citing data from the Unification Ministry in South Korea, Park Byong-seg said there were 1,127 defections last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher prices for human smuggling were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean deserters eventually acquired South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 people from North Korea illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled across China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross because of the highly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks on delaying negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, when they broadly agreed to work to remove nuclear weapons from the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
“Without any confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of our national security and under such conditions, there is no chance that we will unilaterally be the first to disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavanaugh “hysterical,” says he’s not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament made him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Trial Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever behaved like that, she would be called hysterical,” Pelosi said in a statement, referring to her reaction to Kavanaugh’s hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rebuffed allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were teenagers.
During the introductory presentation, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and his throat tightened as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated attack on the personality” orchestrated by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he was seen to have prejudices against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated to provide an answer when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if he was admitted to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll tell you this: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn’t be in the Supreme Court, but in the court he’s currently in,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential judgments against the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade Act because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the subsequent hearing, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how wonderful that is,” Pelosi said.
And women should be proud of that.
It’s a justified criticism, months and years of rage, and she can’t get it out of her head without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s a rare occurrence, right?”
She continued, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was the CEO of a company and who said that she also cried when she got angry, but she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, the person she was talking to would say, ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m sad.
I'm angry."
And then she'd just keep going.
It sounded great to me too.”
Tears are allowed as a vent for anger in part because people fundamentally don’t understand them.
One of my strongest memories is when I was in one of my previous jobs in an office where mostly men were crying out of indescribable anger and when an older woman caught me by the neck – a cold manager I was always a little afraid of – and dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they hit you like that.”
Patricia Schroeder, once a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital love affair aboard a ship called "Ape Business" and dropped out of the race, a deeply frustrated Miss Schroeder realized that there was no reason for her not to try to run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the campaign had already advanced, she was running out of funds, so she swore that she would not enter the race if she failed to raise $2 million.
That battle was doomed.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she gave a speech in which she said she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult for target voters to raise money instead of delegates, and anger at sexism – that her throat tightened.
“Someone would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled about the way the press reacted to her.
“You’d think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what they're gonna put on my gravestone?
“She was crying?”
How a trade war between the U.S. and China could be good for Beijing
Initial shots in the U.S.-China trade war were stifling, and while the battle is nowhere near over, the gap between the countries could be long-term convenient for Beijing, experts say.
US President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods arriving in the United States from China.
Beijing retaliated each time with the same measure, the last time by imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has pledged to return the U.S. to the same measure, and it doesn’t appear that the world’s second-largest economy will change its mind anytime soon.
In order for Washington to withdraw, it needs to bow down to his demands, and publicly agreeing to U.S. terms would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of a trade war with the US could positively impact China in the long run by reducing mutual dependence between the two economies.
“The fact that making a quick decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for the start of an economic sonic war in either of these countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused research associate at the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appeals for help in rebuilding a country destroyed by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer thanks to the progress we have made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normal conditions.
Now there are all conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the regime in Syria would gladly accept assistance in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that financially supported the rebellion.
Europe wins another Ryder Cup in Paris
The European type won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The U.S. has suffered a sixth consecutive defeat on European soil and has not won a single European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe won again by winning a team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn with 14.5 points that he needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who had been tormented for most of the tournament, threw the ball from the bat into the water on a par-3 kick at the 16th hole, handing the match over to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has shined in all rounds and thus became 1 of 4 players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spit is outnumbered by 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player in the European team, Torbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, was beaten 2 and 1 by Ian Polter of England, to whom this may be the last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a of Spain became the European with the most wins in tournaments with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help myself.
This has been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy we won the cup again.
The team is the most important thing and I am happy that I was able to help,” said emotional Garcia after the victory of Europe.
He passed the torch to his countryman John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
I feel incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him," said Ram, 23, in a statement.
Woods lost all four matches he played in France and now has a career record of 13–21-3 points in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, which was surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to make good moves throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk commented on his team's disappointing game, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
At some point this morning we almost reached Europe.
We've been trying.
All the best to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to bow.
We're outplayed."
