Rapidly increasing cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and the UK between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the EU/EEA countries and in the UK, thus confirming that, despite different stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to increase the level of preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients who need treatment and, in particular, intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology were recorded in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the infection is a new type of coronavirus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
From this point on, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 became known as coronavirus infection (COVID-19).
According to data available to date, about 80% of people with COVID-19 have the disease in a mild form, i.e. in the form of respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, with the majority of patients recovering.
Approximately 14% of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe disease with the need for hospitalization, and the remaining 6% take a critical form when intensive care is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
This study analyses the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union (EU) / European Economic Area (EEA) and in the UK and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
After the outbreak in China, COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On March 11, 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Mr. Spiteri and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that met the criteria by which WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on January 24, 2020 – all three cases returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths recorded between 31 December 2019 and that date, of which 17,750 cases, including 1,441 fatalities, are in Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) updates daily at 8:00 a.m. data on the number of registered COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained from official sources such as the health ministries of these countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
This data is used to analyse the trends of the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data on Italy.
As an indicator of the level of prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, the reduced cumulative incidence of COVID-19 over 14 days was calculated taking into account the usual course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in the UK for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also reported a cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 p.m. on March 15, 2020, compared to Italy data for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
Trends in the development of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK
The trends in the 14-day period for the reduced cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole corresponded to the trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to rise around February 21, and on February 28, 2020, there was a sharp jump in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the UK to increase the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK compared to the same figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to these data, the total number of cases already registered as of 8:00 on March 15 in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the UK is comparable to the number recorded in Italy only about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and in the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
And this despite different stages in different countries, differences in the response measures taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of cases and different rules for the selection of patients for analysis for the presence of COVID-19, including "recovery" testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 require intensive care, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions are already as full as possible.
Currently, data on admission of patients with COVID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care units in the EU/EEA are available only in 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current observational data, which are the subject of the number of registered cases and the number of deaths.
According to the results of a study conducted in 2010-2011, there is a significant dispersion in the number of beds in intensive care units and intensive care units in Europe: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds in intensive care units and intensive care units per 100,000 population in 2010-2011).
The sixth update of the ECDC report on the results of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment presents scenarios for modelling the load of resources of health systems with estimated hospitalization data for COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in the UK, when the risk of lack of available beds in intensive care units exceeds 90%.
As cases are currently grouped by specific regions of the EU/EEA and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve the population of a specific territorial group, information on cases of infection and the number of beds in intensive care units is recommended, as far as possible, to be provided per unit of level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should be prepared for a long-lasting SARS-CoV-2 contact infection scenario and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive care, as can be seen, for example, in the affected regions of Italy.
As reported in the latest report of the ECDC on the results of the rapid risk assessment, such an appropriate response to contain the spread of SARS-COV-2 will have a prompt, proactive and integrated approach followed by a transition from containment to minimization of consequences, since, given the projected rapid increase in the number of diseases in decision-makers and hospitals, there may simply not be enough time to make sense of it.
The report on the results of the rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures aimed at mitigating the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If this is not done, the healthcare system in other EU/EEA countries will face an influx of patients in need of intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS) type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has become a tragedy for humanity: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and the number of infected has exceeded 80,000.
Similar to the homologous SARS-CoV virus that caused thousands of people to develop severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and has a lower mortality rate than SARS, but it is much more contagious and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications about the new disease, this article offers an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis of the further course and prevention of this disease.
While the answers to many questions remain to be found, we hope that this review will help to understand and eradicate the dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival (Chinese New Year), which fell on January 25 in 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the holiday and for many weeks after it, due to the outbreak of a new viral infection.
Given the high degree of similarity with the coronavirus (CoV), which caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020 named this virus SARS-CoV-2, and the concomitant disease - coronavirus infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Wuhan and quickly spread across the country and then to almost 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been identified, more than 40,000 patients have recovered, and more than 3,000 patients have died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is “the number one enemy of society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), more than 200 publications on COVID-19 have appeared in less than two months, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus isolated from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarize the results of research in a new and rapidly evolving subject area.
As far as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus-induced disease, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS), which broke out in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts known at the moment about the prevention and prediction of the course of the disease, as well as some other equally pressing issues.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among the pathogens that are not lethal to humans and mainly cause about 15% of total respiratory diseases.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, that is, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of diseases initially in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus outbreak in human history.
As shown in Fig. 1.1, the report on clusters of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first received by the National Health Commission of the PRC from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatality was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic quickly spread to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On January 20, it became known about the infection of health workers, which suggested the possibility of transmission of the virus from person to person.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was quarantined, the city's public transport stopped working.
On January 24, according to the first clinical study of the disease, it was noted that 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coronavirus infection had direct contact with the seafood market in Wuhan, which was considered the starting point for the spread of the infection from an unknown animal.
On January 30, WHO announced that the coronavirus outbreak is a global public health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and degree of risk of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicenter clinical trial involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented the following updated picture of the epidemic (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in all age groups, but mainly affected people between the ages of 30 and 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under 20, and only 14 had not yet reached the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 was spread by clusters mainly in Hubei province and nearby regions.
On average, from the time of the manifestation of symptoms of COVID-19 to the diagnosis took 5 (2-9) days.
The incubation period was an average of 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death, an average of 9.5 (4.8–13) days passed.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51–4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23–4.82.
By January 23, 2020, there was an exponential increase in the number of infected, coinciding with large-scale transportation on the eve of the celebration of the Chinese New Year.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and adjusted mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (<0xE2><0x89><0xA5>60) and severe cases of pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large envelope viruses containing a single strand of semantic RNA.
They can be divided into four types, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect humans.
In the case of SARS and MERS-type coronaviruses, the glycoprotein of the sheathed spine-like processes (S) binds to the cellular receptors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In the cytoplasm, the genome of viral RNA is released; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA together with the enveloped glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates virion-containing vesicles, which then merge with the cell membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports of the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beta-coronavirus, whose genome is 99.98% identical to 10 consecutive samples collected in the first outbreak of the disease, in the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using transparent electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein SARS-CoV-2 binds to the human ACE2 enzyme weaker than SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate a previously unknown short-lived protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may play a role in terms of pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit IFN<0xCE><0xB2> expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, the team of authors led by Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-size human ACE2 enzyme with a resolution of 2.9 <0xC3><0x85> in combination with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed conformations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which serves as evidence when recognizing and infecting the coronavirus.
B0AT1 can be a therapeutic target in drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Host
It is known that the source of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were bats, from which the virus was transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, it was found that the first hosts of SARS-CoV-2 are bats, since the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like coronaviruses, namely SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21 bat coronaviruses.
However, it remains unknown which species became the intermediate host, thanks to which the virus managed to overcome the species barrier and infect humans; the route of transmission also remains to be determined.
Mr. Ji (Ji) and colleagues suggested that snakes became the vectors of the virus from bats to humans, in the process of which homologous recombination in the S-protein occurred.
According to the results of their study, Chinese scientists from Guangzhou hypothesized that pangolins - long-tailed mammals that feed on ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 percent genetic similarity between SARS-CoV and pangolin coronavirus.
However, the 1% difference distributed between the two genomes is still very large, so it is believed that the final results with concrete evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In laboratory conditions, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heating to 56 °C for 30 minutes; it can effectively block the activity of the virus can ether, 75 percent ethyl alcohol, chlorine-containing disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fat-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no detailed studies of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronaviruses, primarily SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Typically, the host virus first recognizes the innate immune system through image-recognizing receptors (ORRs), including C-type lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus provokes the expression of inflammation factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages in relation to viral antigens.
However, thanks to the N-protein SARS-CoV can avoid an immune response.
Soon, an adaptive immune response is involved in the fight against the virus.
T cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
CD4+ T cells stimulate the production of virus-specific antibodies in B cells, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit the function of T cells, causing their programmed death.
Humoral immunity, which includes components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in combating viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from the recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system entails the local formation of a large number of free radicals, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario lead to organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by cluster manifestation, is more likely to affect older people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
The probability of infection is higher for those people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or have disorders of the immune system.
According to the results of the study of data on the first 425 cases of infection in Wuhan, the estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3-7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period lasted on average 3 days, with the spread ranging from 0 to 24 days.
The later study described above, based on demographic data of 8,866 cases, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0–7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the timing of quarantine measures, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected, whose disease is asymptomatic.
A common practice was a 14-day quarantine for people who had contact with the virus or who were infected with the virus.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often high fever, which may be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had shortness of breath and/or hypoxia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed acute respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and (or) symptoms of respiratory disease and acute fever should be checked for the virus for early diagnosis, even in the absence of pathologies in chest images.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 revealed the following indicators of the prevalence of symptoms: 98% - high fever, 76% - dry cough, 55% - shortness of breath and 3% - diarrhea; 8% of patients required artificial ventilation of the lungs.
Similar results were obtained as a result of two recent studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from asymptomatic infected.
Comparable results were obtained in 2012 in a study of patients with MERS-CoV, whose main symptoms were also fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%).
However, 80% of them required artificial lung ventilation, this figure is much higher than among patients with COVID-19, and it corresponds to a higher mortality rate from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high fever (99–100%), dry cough (29–75%), shortness of breath (40–42%), diarrhea (20–25%), and sore throat (13–25%), and artificial ventilation of the lungs is required by 14–20% of patients.
As of February 14, the death rate from COVID-19 was 2%, and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
Compared to this, the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, a demographic study conducted in June 2012 showed a mortality rate of 37% out of 2,494 confirmed cases.
According to the results of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at a level of 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) in the range of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 for SARS-CoV was in the range of only 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV by symptom manifestation, mortality rate and R0 is shown in Table 1.1.
The above indicators indicate a higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to spread compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in case of infection with a new virus is lower compared to the latter two.
Thus, curbing the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Cluster manifestation often occurs when infected within a single family or group of people gathered together for any reason or found themselves together on some transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Wuhan or other affected regions, lived there or had contact with infected or sick people within the last two weeks prior to the onset of the disease.
However, according to the data presented in the reports, people can be carriers of the virus without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and cured patients, when discharged from the hospital, can again become carriers of the virus, and this is an alarming signal to extend the quarantine period.
At an early stage, patients have a normal or reduced number of leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had lymphopenia with leukocyte levels <0x3C> 4<0xC3><0x97>109/L, including leukocyte levels <0x3C> 1<0xC3><0x97>109/L, as well as elevated asparagine aminotransferase and viraemia.
In the blood of some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin were detected, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and red blood cell sedimentation were observed.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was increased, and the number of lymphocytes was constantly reduced.
In most patients with COVID-19, chest X-rays revealed pathologies characterized by uneven dimming on both sides or dimming in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage, and acute respiratory disease (ARD).
With the development of ARI, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis lead to a significant violation of gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytic dysfunction reduces the level of surfactant compounds and increases surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung decline.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray examination often coincide with the most severe cases of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumocytic detachment, hyaline membrane formation and intertissue lymphocytic infiltration, and multinuclear syncytial cells in lung patients who died from the disease correspond to the pathology of viral infection and ARI and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
The method of detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcriptase (PCR with reverse transcriptase) was used as the main criterion in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, given the high level of false-negative results that could accelerate the pace of the epidemic, since February 13, 2020, China has begun to diagnose based on clinical manifestations (no longer relying solely on reverse transcriptase PCR).
The diagnosis of SARS was similar.
Thus, for effective diagnosis, it is critical and necessary to combine the data of the medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and results of X-ray examination.
On February 14, 2020, a team of specialists led by Mr. Feng Zhang, using a complex hour of equipment, described a protocol for the application of a SHERLOCK-free method based on the repetition of CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2; this technique allows the detection of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at a density of 20 <0xC3><0x97> 10–18 mol/l to 200 <0xC3><0x97>
This new technique, if successfully tested on clinical drugs, can significantly increase the sensitivity of tests and the convenience of their conduct.
Because of the lack of experience in responding to the previously unknown coronavirus, doctors are generally able to provide only supportive therapy to patients with COVID-19, while trying to apply any therapeutic methods that have been used or proposed in the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antiviral drugs, immune suppressors, steroids, plasma recovered patients, traditional Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
For treatment, it was proposed to use even the plasma of recovered patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are rushing to develop antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages, SARS-CoV-2 attacks mainly the lungs, and may also affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, to a lesser extent.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Thus, to relieve symptoms and save lives, it is critical to support respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen supply, non-invasive artificial ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, which are prescribed depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified extrapulmonary circulatory technique used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of water-salt balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, as well as the protection of vital organ functions are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be a consequence of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS viruses.
A cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory process that develops in response to the release of a series of cytokines, including TNF<0xCE><0xB1>, IL-1<0xCE><0xB2>, IL-2, IL-6, IFN<0xCE><0xB1>, IFN<0xCE><0xB2>, IFN<0xCE><0xB3>, and MCP-1.
These cytokines provoke immunocytes to release a huge number of free radicals, which become the main cause of the development of ARI and organ failure.
In the treatment of a cytokine storm, especially in patients in a serious condition, suppression of immunity is of paramount importance.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, monoclonal antibodies serving as an interleukin-6 inhibitor, were used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on suppression of immunity include modulation of the immune response aimed at controlling T-cells; blockade of the production of cytokines IFN-<0xCE><0xB3>, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of janus kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine signal suppressors 4 and inhibitor.
To reduce the severity of the consequences of inflammatory processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely used as immune suppressors.
However, steroids in high dosages are of no benefit in the treatment of severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly worsen the prognosis.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 in a critical condition.
At the time of drafting this document, there is no confirmed effective antiviral therapy.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has proven to be an effective treatment for an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a newly developed antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat diseases caused by the Ebola virus and the Marburg virus.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated the ability to suppress other viruses from single-stranded RNA, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this drug formulation to China to conduct paired studies on patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, <0xCE><0xB1>-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible treatment options for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects.
The interaction of these drugs with other drugs prescribed to patients should be monitored with caution.
Plasma of recovered patients and production of antibodies
Blood collection in patients who have been cured of an infectious disease, for the treatment of other patients suffering from the same disease, or for the protection of a healthy population has been used for a long time.
In fact, the blood of recovered patients often contains a relatively high amount of antibodies to fight the pathogen.
Antibodies are in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects; they recognize individual pathogen molecules and target them.
Based on this premise, plasma was isolated from blood samples from a group of patients cured of COVID-19, which was then administered to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the severity of inflammation and viral load decreased, and blood oxygen saturation increased.
However, in order to propose the mass application of this method before the conduct of specific therapy, no verification and no explanations are required.
In addition, taking into account the therapeutic effect, some disadvantages associated with the use of plasma should be carefully studied.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune system and cause cytokine release syndrome, which, given its toxicity, poses a potential threat to life.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and a lot of plasma is required to treat patients in a critical condition.
It is not easy to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to overcome a global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to isolate the B-cells of recovered patients and determine the genetic code of the active antibodies or carry out a screening to find the active antibodies against the critical proteins of the virus.
So we can immediately move on to mass production of antibodies.
For thousands of years, the Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness largely depends on the combination of many components of the formula, the composition of which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease, based on the theories of Chinese traditional medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have an uncertain effect, as it is difficult to identify and test these components or their optimal combination.
Currently, due to the lack of effective specific therapy for COVID-19, Chinese traditional medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients recovering from a severe stage of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Liang Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest proportion of recovering COVID-19 patients was in a number of provinces in China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used in the treatment of 87% of patients, including in Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while in Hubei province, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of only about 30% of patients.
However, this is a rather rough comparison, since the assessment must take into account many other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On February 18, 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang and his colleagues published the study, which compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and Chinese traditional medicine.
They found that the timing of normalization of body temperature, elimination of symptoms and medical care in a hospital was significantly less in patients for whom a combination of methods of Western and Chinese traditional medicine was used than in patients who were treated only with Western methods.
The most surprising is the fact that the proportion of patients who began to worsen symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the group treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine techniques than in the group treated only with Western methods (7.8 percent compared to 46.2 percent), and the mortality rate in the first group was lower.
However, the efficacy and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still requires more closely monitored studies conducted on a larger scale and in more regions.
It is also of interest to obtain, if possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the techniques of Chinese traditional medicine, or a combination thereof.
Patients who suspect or have confirmed the presence of COVID-19 generally experience a strong fear of an acute and even deadly disease, and people who are quarantined also experience boredom, loneliness, and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatment, such as insomnia from corticosteroids, can cause even more anxiety and psychological stress.
In the early stages of the SARS virus outbreak, a number of psychiatric conditions have been reported, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor agitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicidal behavior.
Compulsory contact tracking and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to contain the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people’s anxiety and guilt associated with the spread of infection, quarantine and social stigma on their families and friends.
In this regard, psychological and psychiatric care should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons under suspicion and contact with them, as well as to all other people who need it.
As part of psychological support, multidisciplinary psychiatric care teams should be formed, clear information should be provided with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and professional electronic devices and applications should be used to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in breaking the chain of transmission from animal carriers and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to antiviral therapy used to contain epidemics caused by new viruses.
Work has been done to create S-protein-based vaccines that aim to produce long-lived and highly active neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
In animal studies, live attenuated vaccines against SARS viruses were developed.
However, prior to the start of clinical trials, it is still necessary to determine the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural conditions when used in elderly patients, the model of infection with lethal doses and the degree of protection against infection with zoonotic viruses.
Perhaps the reason is that the SARS virus disappeared 17 years ago, and no new cases have been reported since.
At the same time, sporadic cases and clusters of the disease caused by the MERS virus continue to emerge in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the preservation of zoonotic sources in the endemic habitats.
To combat MERS, vaccination strategies have been developed using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein elements, and some of these strategies have been evaluated in animals.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people without immunity is an urgent and critical task, requiring a solution to contain the raging epidemic.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long duration (average 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic modification of coronaviruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a complete picture of the clinical course of the disease at the expense of thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to gradually recover without complications.
However, COVID-19, similarly to SARS and MERS, is also associated with a high incidence of complications and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
In this regard, it is critical for health authorities to develop a predictive model of the disease in order to prioritize their actions, especially in areas where resources are scarce.
Based on the data from clinical studies presented to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of the disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the course of disease caused by the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients between the ages of 30 and 65, 47.7% of whom are over 50, according to the above-mentioned study of 8,866 cases.
Patients who required intensive care were more likely to have baseline illnesses and complications, and they were significantly older than those who did not require intensive care (an average of 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection is higher among men than among women (0.31/100 000 vs. 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Incidence and complications: Covid-19 patients who require intensive therapy are more likely to develop acute myocardial damage and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is worth noting that age and baseline diseases are closely interrelated and can distort the results.
Deviations identified in laboratory studies: the level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage, and it is proposed to be considered as a potential prognostic factor in the course of the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
It was also suggested to consider the relationship between C-reactive protein levels, disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase can also predict the result.
These enzymes are excreted in large quantities by various organs, especially the heart and liver, and their release occurs when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: To predict outcomes and complications in the treatment of COVID-19, among other factors should take into account the data of chest X-ray examination and the development of clinical symptoms over time.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune suppressors widely used in infectious diseases as an adjunctive therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids were widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis, which caused lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if steroids are needed for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these drugs should be prescribed in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, amid the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from unforeseen severe stress, as they often have to endure long periods of quarantine, cope with a high degree of uncertainty, and observe the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve stress in such patients and help them return to normal life, they must be psychologically consulted and provided with long-term support.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, like other coronaviruses that cause common colds, can successfully multiply in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms at an early stage of infection.
For this reason, those patients who have an early stage of the disease or have not yet ended the incubation period, can, leading their normal life, spread the virus on a significant scale, which significantly complicates epidemiological control.
However, it was believed that SARS-CoV transmission occurs when patients are severely ill, although in most cases infection did not occur at an early stage.
Thus, today’s COVID-19 epidemic is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently working hard to declare a general quarantine in Wuhan and neighboring cities, as well as extending the quarantine regime for almost the entire population, introduced in order to break the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread chain.
Although these measures cause enormous damage to the economy and other areas of life of the country, the number of new patients detected is decreasing, which indicates a slowdown in the spread of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic calculations, the outbreak of the disease will end by March, and the phase of attenuation will last 3-4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter and colleagues calculated that the COVID-19 outbreak, which looks much more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Researchers from a group led by Ira Longini have compiled a model to predict the end of the epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two-thirds of the world’s population.
A team of Canadian experts reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in nose and throat swabs taken from patients who had recovered and had been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclic disease similar to the flu.
However, the decline in new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the strategies currently in place may have had an effect.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was expected to affect up to a million people and cause the death of half a million patients.
But due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease eventually managed to get under control.
There is a chance that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the SARS-CoV-2 virus’s infective ability may weaken, and over time it will disappear or become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
Below is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by a high rate of transmission through coughing or sneezing, and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also found in feces, which means an oral-fecal method of transmission is also possible.
According to one recent study, 41% of the 138 cases studied may have been the result of infection in a hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical staff.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even outsiders, who are in contact with patients or infected.
The first line of defense in the fight to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both surgical masks and N95-class respirators (series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not allow microdrops of fluid from potentially infected to fly away in the air and settle on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to others.
However, only masks of class N95 (series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of virions from a size of 10 to 80 nm, they pass only 5% of virions; the SARS-CoV-2 virus is the same size as the SARS-CoV, and they are both about 85 nm in size.
Since the particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked together, health care professionals in direct contact with patients are required to wear N95-class masks (series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical professionals should wear a protective robe tailored to the figure to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also enter the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor contracted SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care professionals should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type safety glasses.
All populations in affected or potentially endangered regions are strongly encouraged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectants, try to avoid leaving the house while maintaining self-isolation, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of about a meter.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, the high degree of its similarity to SARS-CoV, reported on January 7, 2020, was supposed to be an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, only after January 19, 2020, the director of the Centers for Disease Control in Wuhan reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity when transmitted from person to person and that the prevention of spread and control of the disease will not be a problem.
This statement greatly reduced social tensions, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the Chinese New Year, and a critical time was missed when the disease could be contained within Wuhan with minimal losses.
China’s health authorities can learn this harsh lesson and make meaningful improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more cautious public statements as each word is taken into account by the public and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) more closely monitor and respond to unusual information coming from clinics rather than wait for official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more decisive measures to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development rather than in the early stages of its development.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the previously unexplored severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease covered the whole of China and at the time of writing, it had spread to 50 countries around the world.
Because the virus is very similar to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a recurrence of SARS occurred with the COVID-19 outbreak.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, significant in terms of containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the proportion of severe cases and mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
SARS mortality is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even with asymptomatic disease, while patients with SARS usually infect others only in severe cases of the disease, so it is more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and more extensively than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal tests for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, cured patients may again show positive tests for the virus.
All this significantly increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Against the backdrop of such rapid advances in COVID-19 research, some critical issues remain unresolved, namely:
What is the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the detection of a 96 percent homolog between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection came from bats.
What animal became the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, for example, from bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot reliably interrupt the transmission path, and the epidemiological situation can escalate at any moment.
Molecular-level modelling and biochemical tests have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus infiltrate airway cells and provoke subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2 producing cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot provide a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus genetically evolve during human-to-human transmission?
Will it cause a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur periodically like the flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other questions.
However, we have no choice but, whatever it costs, to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
The zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated the co-evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their carriers, including humans, for millennia.
Until 2003, it was known that two human coronaviruses (HCoV) caused a mild illness, such as the common cold.
Outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in central China at the end of 2019 once again drew attention to coronaviruses and surprised us with the high transmission but less pronounced pathogenicity of this virus compared to the related SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronavirus infection is zoonosis, and understanding its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coronaviruses come from bats for which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoirs of some human coronaviruses are also known.
The definition of carrier animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
Studying the interaction of animals carrying coronaviruses can also shed light on the pathogenesis of the coronavirus in humans.
In this review, we provide available data on seven human coronaviruses, focusing on the history of their detection, as well as their zoonotic origin and methods of interspecies transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing different human coronaviruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the current epidemic of the disease caused by the coronavirus detected in 2019 (COVID-19) is also considered.
In addition, the conditions necessary for a successful change of carriers and the impact of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the course of the disease are noted.
Coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of enveloped viruses with one positive-polar strand of RNA.
These viruses with the largest genome among RNA-containing viruses, containing between 26,000 and 32,000 nucleotides, are named for their shape, which when viewed under an electron microscope resembles a corona.
In terms of structure, coronaviruses contain unsegmented genomes with identical organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open partially overlapping reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 unstructured proteins designated nsp1<0x7E>16.
The rest of the genome contains an open reading frame for structured proteins, including the spine-like protein (S), the membrane protein (E), the membrane protein (M) and the nucleoprotein (N).
In other lines of coronaviruses, a number of lines of specific accessor proteins are also encoded.
Based on differences in protein sequences, coronaviruses are divided into four species (alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-coronaviruses), with the type of beta-coronaviruses comprising most human coronaviruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and beta-coronaviruses are bats and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly overcome interspecies barriers, and some of them have evolved into dangerous pathogens for humans.
There are currently seven known human coronaviruses.
These include the human alpha-coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus of the second type, SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronaviruses HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as colds and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and newly discovered SARS-CoV-2 viruses are extremely pathogenic, causing severe lower respiratory tract infections in a relatively larger number of patients with a higher likelihood of developing acute respiratory disease (ARD) and manifestations of extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first strand of human coronavirus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample extracted from the nasopharynx of patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive research has accumulated more detailed knowledge about the HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 viruses that cause symptoms of local infection.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that human coronavirus infection was generally considered harmless.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in current history; more than 8,000 people have been affected, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a prolonged epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with the disease sporadically spreading to the rest of the world.
Discovered in 2019, the new human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current coronavirus epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which as of March 3, 2020 claimed more than 3,120 lives and the number of infected exceeded 91,000 people.
An alarming signal has been received, and the world must prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronaviruses are of zoonotic origin, their sources are bats, mice or pets.
Numerous data sets support the evolutionary nature of the origin of all human coronaviruses from bats, to whose organisms the viruses have adapted well and in which they do not show pathogenic properties, but show a wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has challenged China and the world medically, scientifically, socially and morally.
The study of the zoonotic mechanism of origin of human coronaviruses will allow to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution and the factors limiting interspecies transfer.
It may also prompt or speed up the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplifying carrier of SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the disease from spreading again in the future.
This review provides general information on the zoonotic origin, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we designate and consider the following general feature: the original viruses from which human coronaviruses originated are usually not pathogenic to their reservoir carriers, but acquire a pathogenic nature after interspecies transmission to a new carrier.
We also analyze the evolution of human coronaviruses, according to which an increase in transmission is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogenic properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also considered.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before strain B814 of the HCoV-229E virus was first derived from a sample separated from the nasopharynx of patients with colds, various coronaviruses were found in various infected animals, including turkeys, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coronaviruses have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of detection of human coronaviruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was derived from samples taken from the respiratory tract of patients with infectious upper respiratory tract disease in 1966; this virus subsequently adapted to reproduction in the lung cell lines of WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, general malaise, and sore throat, although fever and cough were observed in 10–20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 virus was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage into the brains of suckling mice.
Clinical signs of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are indistinguishable from other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCoV-229E virus and the HCoV-OC43 virus are ubiquitous in the world and are usually transmitted in winter at temperate latitudes.
Basically, the incubation period of these two viruses lasts less than a week, followed by about two weeks of disease.
According to the results of a study in volunteers, healthy people infected with the HCoV-229E virus developed a common cold of mild form.
Only a few patients with weakened immunity showed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The SARS outbreak, also known as the “atypical pneumonia epidemic,” was the first well-documented pandemic caused by the human coronavirus, and the causative agent of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coronaviruses.
The first case of SARS was identified in late 2002 in the Chinese province of Guangdong.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases and 774 deaths were documented, and the disease spread to many countries and continents.
Excluding overactive distributors, it was estimated that each patient could infect about two more people; the incubation period was from 4 to 7 days, and the peak viral load was on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headaches, fever, general malaise and chills, and later symptoms included shortness of breath, cough, and respiratory failure.
Common laboratory abnormalities with SARS are lymphopenia, abnormalities in liver samples and increased creatine kinase levels.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation of the lungs.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, can also be infected, which is usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal, especially for patients with weakened immunity.
For the first time, the virus was isolated from an open lung biopsy of a relative of the patient who came to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to study human coronaviruses.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands.
It was first found to mainly affect young children, the elderly and patients with weakened immunity and respiratory diseases.
The disease caused by HCoV-NL63 is characterized by such manifestations as cold, conjunctivitis, high fever and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study described the release of the same virus from nasal material taken from an 8-month-old Dutch boy suffering from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but in fact it is widespread.
According to estimates, HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7% of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks of diseases caused by it occur at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to outpatient pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 is associated with exacerbation of asthmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the HCoV-HKU1 virus that causes mild respiratory disease has been detected worldwide.
All of these four human coronaviruses, which cause extra-hospital infections, have adapted well to humans, and their mutation, which entails highly pathogenic diseases, is generally unlikely, although the incidents were and their causes are unknown, as in a rare example with a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which, according to recent reports, has caused serious infections.
Usually, by acquiring the ability to effectively transmit and persist in the human body, these human coronaviruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from a 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and kidney failure.
Most laboratory-confirmed cases have occurred in the Middle East, but various European countries and Tunisia have recorded import cases and spread through episodic secondary cases of close contact infection.
Another secondary outbreak with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resemble symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - both infections are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal failure, which still distinguishes MERS from other diseases caused by human-borne coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome with a high mortality rate (34.4%) have been reported, so MERS-CoV is considered one of the deadliest viruses known to man.
In the period from mid to late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were identified in Wuhan, Hubei, China, which is now being linked to an infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency, and the disease itself has been dubbed “Coronavirus Infection 19” (COVID-19).
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that the mortality rate in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2%, and outside of it - 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2, like the SARS and MERS coronaviruses, causes a severe respiratory infection characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly go into acute respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarity of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, given the high homology of nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses nevertheless form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic, but has a higher transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic infection of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported, indicating the ability of this virus to spread rapidly around the world.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses reveals important similarities and differences.
First, coronaviruses transmitted to humans have a similar incubation period and the duration of the course of diseases caused by them.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend as the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses causing extrahospital infections (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are similar to what are most often observed when infected with human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms, or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases can be identified, although the ratio here is slightly lower.
Thirdly, in terms of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, there are also interesting patterns that are characteristic of both human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of human coronaviruses causing extra-hospital infections.
On the other hand, it remains to be checked whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases with each subsequent transmission of the virus (i.e. infection of each subsequent person), as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the fecal-oral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is as significant (at least in some circumstances) as it is in the case of SARS-CoV.
Of particular interest is the question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2, characteristic of human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections.
However, the future development of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak will depend on the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogenicity, and sustainable spread after passing through humans.
All four human coronaviruses that cause extra-hospital infections with mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
On the other hand, it may be that people have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both of them could be called the only survivors of human coronavirus pandemics in the past.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe illnesses in humans, and people whose human coronaviruses cause severe illnesses, simply did not survive.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in the human body sufficiently to accumulate adaptive mutations counteracting carrier constraint factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak lasts and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is to fully adapt to the person.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other infectious disease control measures.
For many years, four extra-hospital coronaviruses have been circulating among the population, causing the common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require a reservoir animal.
The highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses have not adapted well enough to humans, and their transmission to humans cannot be maintained.
They need to survive and reproduce in their zoonotic reservoirs and look for cases of falling into susceptible human targets, perhaps through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV, and four extrahospital HCoV viruses.
It is very easily transmitted as out-of-hospital HCoV, at least now.
But it is more pathogenic than outpatient HCoV, and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it adapts fully to humans and whether it will circulate in a human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate carrier animal.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, it will be useful for us to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, intermediate, amplifying and reservoir carriers of HCoV viruses.
The animal serves as an evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and non-pathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the reservoir carrier constantly carries HCoV over a long time.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally infected and are the natural carriers of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was only introduced into an intermediate medium just before or around the time it was introduced to a human, it was not well adapted to the new medium and often pathogenic.
This intermediate carrier can serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an amplifying carrier, allowing the virus to replicate lightning-fast and then transmitting it to humans, increasing the scale of human infection.
HCoV can carry a dead end infection if it cannot withstand transmission inside the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-lasting endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier becomes a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the zero patient SARS had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals (wild animals).
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Himalayan civets (Paguma larvata) and raccoon-like dog in live animal markets became the first established carriers of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly confirmed by the fact that after the destruction of all civets in the markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that in Himalayan civets living in nature or on farms and not hitting the markets, in most cases SARS-CoV was not determined, which suggests that Himalayan civets could only serve as an intermediate amplifying carrier, and not a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that since 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that numerous small mammal species may also serve as intermediate amplifiers cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be dead end carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
Subsequent search for the natural carrier animal SARS-CoV revealed a closely related CoV of bats, which was called the HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3)-associated coronavirus of horseshoe-bearing bats and which is present in Chinese horseshoe-bearing bats.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
These and other bat coronaviruses have 88-92% of the same nucleotide sequence homology as SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats have become carriers of new human pathogens.
In bats, several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified, but none other than one that denotes WIV1 can be isolated as a living virus.
The SARS-CoV receptor is known to be the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2).
WIV1, derived from a sample of bat faeces, has been shown to use ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Curiously, the serums of recovering patients with SARS could have neutralized WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct parent SARS-CoV virus, and bats are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis classifies MERS-CoV to the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bats, and CoV-HKU5 of bats.
CoV-HKU4 bats and MERS-CoV use the same carrier receptor, dipeptidyldipeptidase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequences of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of MERS-CoV virus are phylogenetically closer to those of bat beta-coronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV virus has been found in wild bats.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of bats is only 87%.
That is, bats may not have been a direct reservoir carrier of the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that single camels are seropositive to MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, as are camels of Middle Eastern origin in many African countries.
Live MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, was isolated from the nasal smears of single camels, further confirming the role of camels as true reservoir carriers of MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV had minor symptoms, but massive viral excretion.
It is noteworthy that infected camels excreted the virus not only by the respiratory route, but also by the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of excretion of the virus in bats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome have had no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms and are plausible for human-to-human transmission or transmission through unknown channels including unidentified animal species that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The homology of SARS-CoV-2 nucleotides is 96.2% consistent with the CoV RaTG13 of bats isolated from the Asian horseshoe Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute to them parental relationships.
That is, bats may not be a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2, unless in the future almost identical bat coronaviruses are found.
Presumably, the immediate SARS-CoV-2 carrier animals should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, with which many initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely case of transmission from an animal to a human.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have concluded that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also carry parental beta-coronavirus, a related strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the nucleotide sequences of these new pangolin coronavirus genomes coincides with SARS-CoV-2 by 85–92%.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with identity at the level of nucleotide sequences being about 90%.
They are clustered into two sublines of differentiation of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor-binding domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with an amino acid sequence identity of 97.4%.
Conversely, the RDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 strains are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequence homology across the genome.
An earlier study of pangolin patients also reported the detection of viral contingencies in samples from the lungs, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used other assembly and manual processing techniques to produce a genome sequence that includes about 86.3% of the full-sized viral genome.
It cannot be ruled out that pangolin has become one of the intermediate carrier animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the divergence of sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangolin beta-coronaviruses associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals has not yet been established.
While the highest sequence homology was found in RCDs between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 have the highest sequence homology across the genome.
Very theoretically, the high degree of similarity between the beta-coronaviruses of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is associated with parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposition advocates a recombination between the beta-coronavirus pangolins, related to SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-coronaviruses.
A final decision on the direct zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be made.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV viruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may originate from bat coronaviruses, while parent HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are found in rodents.
The bat coronavirus, called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and detected in the North American tricolor sucker, has been reported to show close affinity with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that its intermediate carrier may have been camels.
For clarity, modern knowledge about the animal origin of known coronaviruses is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of interspecies transmission of HCoV in the anamnesis.
When, around 1890, there was interspecies transmission of the HCoV-OC43 virus and people became infected from pets, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
Alpha-coronaviruses of bats, closely related to HCoV-229E, have been detected.
Between them is alphacoronavirus alpaca.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, it was humans, not alpacas, who could contact bats in a common ecological niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alpacas.
Secondly, bat alpha-coronaviruses related to HCoV-229E in bats are diverse and non-pathogenic, while alpha-coronavirus alpaca caused a respiratory attack in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coronavirus alpaca has not been detected in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be ruled out that the Alpacas received the alpha-coronavirus, related to HCoV-229E, from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while bat alpha-coronaviruses could serve as a gene pool for the HCoV-229E virus, alpacas and single camels could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just like MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to single camels and from single camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of the MERS-CoV virus from bats is known from its initial identification and was then confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is obvious that bats provide a rich pool of varieties of viruses for interspecies exchange of gene fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and the ability to fly make bats "perfect distributors".
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus was introduced to single camels decades ago.
It adapted well to these camels, which turned from an intermediate carrier into a stable and natural reservoir carrier.
In these animals, the MERS-CoV virus causes a very mild disease and is characterized by a relatively low mutation rate.
Its episodic transmission to a person is an accident, and the person remains a dead-end carrier of MERS-CoV, as its transmission is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus is different.
In particular, beta-coronaviruses of pangolins are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be dead-end carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
In future studies, it is necessary to confirm or exclude several possibilities of interspecies transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus from animals to humans.
First, bats can be a reservoir carrier for a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share an ecological niche with bats through coal mining or carving the carcasses of these animals.
Secondly, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifying carriers in which the related SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently fallen.
Humans are infected with the virus by cutting carcasses and eating meat from wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Examination of domestic and wild animals for antibodies is justified.
Thirdly, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form, which contacted both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to the different types of carrier animals, three main factors from viruses also contributed to the crossing of interspecies barriers.
First of all, their relatively high rate of mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated frequency of coronavirus mutations can be considered “moderate-high” with an average replacement rate of approximately 10–4 substitutions per year at one site 2 depending on the phase of coronavirus adaptation to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have corrective exoribonuclease, the removal of which leads to an extremely high frequency of mutation and weakening or even nonviability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue of Remdesivir inhibits the replication of coronaviruses by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronavirus mutations is almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the frequency of mutations can often be even higher if the coronaviruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is visibly lower, indicating a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, this virus has already adapted to another carrier close to the person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single camels.
In theory, vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 are unlikely to quickly lose efficacy as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large RNA genome in coronaviruses leads to greater plasticity in genomic modification with respect to mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies co-evolution favorable for the emergence of new coronaviruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open reading frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the direction of the 3<0xE2><0x80><0xB2>-end of the genome.
Thirdly, due to the unique matrix selection mechanism, coronaviruses randomly and often switch matrices during RNA replication.
During the transcription of coronavirus DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, there is often a switching of threads.
High-homological full-sized and sub-genomic RNAs can recombine and create new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9 of bat mice.
Virus-carrier interaction with respect to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, another key factor important for interspecies transmission is the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor.
In this article, as a typical example, which also demonstrates evidence of positive selection in interspecies transmission events, the recombination of SARS-CoV is given.
Based on a comparative analysis between human and civet SARS-CoV strains, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different carriers, especially with regard to mutations in S-protein RSD.
In general, the S-protein RSD of the coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor, and the carrier antibody response intensively selects it.
RSD in SARS-CoV are amino acids, from 318th to 510th, on a fragment of S1, which for the introduction of the virus into the cell binds to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (APF2) of a person, as well as its co-receptors.
The SARS-CoV RSD virus is able to recognize the APF2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, making it possible for interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been found in RSD, which differ from human viral strains and civets, with 4 of them in the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have mutations K479N and S487T in RSD, which can increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can be particularly important for the virus to adapt to humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S segment leads to the fact that the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope suggests that the affinity of this link is 10–20 times higher than between human APF2 and SARS-CoV virus protein S.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other co-receptors are required for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to APF2, but to another segment of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsial acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from carrier animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of HCoV interspecies transmission is also controlled by other factors of dependence and constraint of the carrier.
The divergence of these carrier proteins between humans and natural reservoir carriers of HCoVs, such as bats, solitary camels and rodents, can be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For successful interspecies transmission to HCoV viruses, it is necessary to usurp the factors of dependence and subordinate the factors of restriction of carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be defined and categorized.
Good results can be achieved by impartial full-genome screening of dependency factors and media restriction for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology.
The emergence of new HCoV: back to zero
The variety of bat coronaviruses creates ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses serve as a genetic pool for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driving the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new genes encoding proteins has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV accessor proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but have been found to encode ORF8 divergent proteins.
In strains isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic, a 29-nucleotide deletion characteristic of SARS-CoV coronaviruses was found.
This deletion breaks ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is considered an adaptive mutation that accelerates the change of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination localizations have also been determined in non-structural nsp9 proteins, most nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, the epidemic MERS-CoV was shown to have undergone recombinant events between different lines, which occurred in single camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCoVs in which HCoV was recombined with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in viral genomes, which most likely occurs as a result of getting rid of the virus from the selective pressures exerted, for example, by the carrier's immune system.
An example of such effects is the loss of the full-size ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to dinucleotide deletion.
While an intact open ORF4 reading frame can be observed in HCoV-229E-related bat and camel viruses, alpha-coronavirus alpaca demonstrates single-nucleotide insertion, resulting in a frame shift.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoVs is also driven by the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
In case of infection of bats with coronaviruses, mild symptoms or their absence were recorded, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
It turned out that bats are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronaviruses.
For example, pro-inflammatory response activation defects in bats effectively reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the natural activity of killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the apregulation of the inhibitory receptor of natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of molecules of the main histocompatibility complex of class I.
Moreover, the high level of active oxygen forms, which is provided by the high metabolic activity of bats, can suppress the replication of the coronavirus, simultaneously affecting the reading by exoribonuclease, thus creating a selection pressure to generate strains of the virus that, when penetrated into a new carrier, turn out to be highly pathogenic.
More pathogenic strains of the coronavirus may also evolve as a result of recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last twenty years.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir carriers, such as bats or camels.
They confidently replicate without causing a strong immune response in the carrier.
This is the secret to why we see asymptomatic carriers, and what causes severe cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly associated with hyperactivation of the immune response and a cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more serious the lung damage.
On the contrary, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response is not associated with the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of non-binding the immune response can have beneficial effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
In bats, the interferon response is particularly strong.
Thus, taking interferon type I at least in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should have a beneficial effect.
In addition, in bats, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasoma is impaired.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflamasoma by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general scheme by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated.
While bat beta-coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 95% identical to SARS-CoV, has been found, there is also bat coronavirus, whose nucleotide homology is 96% identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in markets carry viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no intermediate carriers for SARS-CoV-2 have been directly identified.
Pangolin beta-coronaviruses, strikingly homologous SARS-CoV-2, have been detected, suggesting that pangolins may have served as one of the intermediate carriers, or that fragments of pangolin beta-coronavirus genes may have entered the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intentionally or accidentally created by humans.
Coronaviruses have attracted widespread attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origin and HCoV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Persuasive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and have been transmitted to humans via intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection comes from contact between humans and civets in markets, closing the game markets and destroying the civets on them could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in light of the discovery of various beta-coronavirus lines of pangolins, closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be removed to prevent zoonotic transmission from food markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals and how this can happen remains a challenge for future research.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has long existed in solitary camels.
These camels serve as an important vehicle as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop periodic MERS outbreaks, an integrated approach is needed to develop an effective MERS-CoV vaccine for camels in combination with other infectious control measures.
Because we can’t eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can emerge that cause outbreaks of the disease.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses circulate in the world.
In particular, the coronaviruses of bats with zoonotic potential are extremely diverse.
There is a huge variety of opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonotic coronaviruses, which in the future will lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more deadly to humans.
To reduce unnecessary human-animal contact, a culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned.
After severe trials such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and a plan to respond to such situations are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until it is possible to seize new territories.
Although many of the properties of bats are conducive to the spread of viruses, if you teach people to stay away from them, you can minimize the likelihood of human contact with bats and other species of wild animals.
To better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural carriers, constant epidemiological surveillance of mammals is needed, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of coronaviruses from animals to humans and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep people away from the ecological niches of natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
In the puzzle of zoonotic origin SARS-CoV-2 is still missing some fragments.
First, if bats have transmitted the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is interesting to see under what circumstances bats and pangolins share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, then it is necessary to determine how humans came into contact with bats.
Third, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is played by a third mammal, then it is necessary to find out how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin, or another mammal, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursor viruses will be identified in their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases” of COVID-19 need to be updated
On February 6, 2020, our group published a 2019 (2019-nCoV) guidebook on the diagnosis and treatment of new coronavirus infection, which provides insights into our experience and validated recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, 2019 coronavirus infection (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has increased gradually based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and cite the latest diagnostic criteria for “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the “Recommendations on Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the PRC.
In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), now officially called coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the viral disease itself was called "severe acute respiratory syndrome 2" (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a brief guide and published it online on the Military Medical Research website on February 6, 2020.
This publication attracted a lot of attention.
We note that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge has gradually increased based on current research results and clinical experience; thus, diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, between January 16 and March 3, 2020, seven issues of the document “Recommendations on diagnosis and therapy for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), with the content of some of its provisions significantly changed.
Recently, Zhou’s work with co-authors provided comments on our recommendations. They contained simple diagnostic suggestions based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and provided valuable background information on this worldwide pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest edition of the “Recommendations for Diagnosis and Therapy for COVID-19” (trial seventh version) and the results of current research, their work needs to be updated.
According to the seventh edition of this document (as of March 3, 2020), in order to carry out a comprehensive analysis in confirming the case of suspicion of the disease, it is necessary to combine any one element of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of movements or places of residence in the city of Wuhan and its surroundings; (4) a history of contacts with patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with high temperatures.
Clinical manifestations: (1) high fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) the presence of external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) the total number of leukocytes is normal or decreased with a reduced number of lymphocytes at an early stage of the manifestation of symptoms.
The diagnosis for a confirmed case of the disease should be based on the case of suspected anti-inflammatory IgV with a corresponding anti-inflammatory IgV result for one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidences, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) full-genomic virus sequencing shows high homogeneity with respect to new coronaviruses; (3) positive serotest results for specific SAVs
It can also be noted that in the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) editions of this document, a real-time PCR test for nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added.
Pathogenetic diagnosis of the blood sample was added in the fourth (January 27, 2020) and fifth (February 8, 2020) issues; and then the need for serological evidence was added in the seventh issue.
These changes are based on the results of the continuous work of the researchers involved in the search for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids in a rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from the respiratory tract, including the selection of blood samples, which increases the availability of various samples and contributes to the inclusion of positive test results for specific antibodies in the criteria for confirming the disease.
At the same time, there is increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients without pronounced symptoms.
Thus, the route map presented in Zhou’s work, etc., should be updated, since it classifies persons without clinical symptoms as a “low-risk” group.
The system of assessments also requires clarification in further clinical practice and research.
In conclusion, we hope to receive more direct evidence and encourage readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “suspect cases” and “confirmed cases”, we encourage readers to monitor and strictly follow the latest recommendations that are given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also update its recommendations in a timely manner in order to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh Reports Five New COVID-19 Deaths – Daily Maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths per day.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus per day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that 114 reported cases of infection included current cases, as well as 33 recovered patients who were at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR Director Dr. Mirjabi Sabrina Flora said the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, two of the deceased were over the age of 60, two were between the ages of 51 and 60, and one was between the ages of 41 and 50.
She also said the two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
An employee of the clinic told local news agency Anadolu that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti clinic Maitri.
Bangladesh’s Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said on Saturday in an online video statement that public transport would be suspended for a longer period than originally planned until next Saturday.
Public transport was halted from March 26 and was due to resume on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods—medicine, fuel, and food—was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were reported in Bangladesh on March 8 in two people who returned from Italy, as well as in the wife of one of them.
As of March 19, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed the millionth number of infections worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University, on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection worldwide exceeded one million.
Covid-19 has killed at least 52,000 people.
The milestone came on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of death from the coronavirus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday it was one of the few countries in which there were no cases of coronavirus infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours preceding 10:00 CET on April 4.
In the United States, there were more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus infection, of which at least 5,900 were fatal.
CBS News, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, reported that more than 1,000 deaths were recorded in the United States on Wednesday due to coronavirus infection.
Countries around the world have announced tightening measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the self-isolation regime of the city's citizens until May 1.
Earlier, President Vladimir Putin said that Russians across the country, despite self-isolation, will receive wages until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina by a full day, while earlier the curfew lasted only from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a curfew from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike Dewayne announced that the state’s home isolation regime has been extended by order until May 1.
Shops in Australia limit the number of toilet paper packages that can be purchased at a time
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles reduced the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased at one time in all stores in the country to two and one packages, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a one-pack limit.
These restrictions were reported in ads at checkouts, as well as on the network page on Facebook.
Citizens are reportedly starting to make emergency supplies because of fears that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of a general self-isolation regime.
On Wednesday, the Woolworths network also limited the amount of toilet paper purchased to one package.
Earlier, on March 4 and 5, respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited this number to 4 packages.
In a March 8 press release, Coles said that with the four-pack limit being introduced, “toilet paper is still being bought too quickly in many stores — one delivery per hour,” and called such demand “unprecedented,” while ALDI called the trend “unexpected” in a Facebook post published Tuesday.
According to Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
A Costco store in Canberra last week also limited that amount to two packages.
To fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger batches from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made inventories for a special early-sale stock on Wednesdays.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers are trying to restock, but this is hampered by local authorities’ restrictions on truck travel schedules.
It expects an increase in the cost of products, as suppliers try to meet the demand, but at the same time there are fewer and fewer profitable offers available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that due to depletion of stocks, some stores are unable to hold shares on Wednesdays.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at Queensland University of Technology, said that stores replenish stocks every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a cumbersome commodity, so the number of stocks is small, and after the sale of the entire volume of goods, long rows of shelves remain empty, increasing the feeling of shortage of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand sanitizers could be placed on these shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not panic,” says Russell Zimmerman.
On Wednesday, the manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap announced the end of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the toilet paper manufacturer Kleenex and Solaris Paper, which also manufactures Sorbent products, said they work around the clock to ensure a sufficient number of products.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne declined due to a lack of buyers on Labor Day week, some real estate sellers began offering free toilet paper to the first bidders.
The fourth edition of the Darwin-based daily NT News included an eight-page tab designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
According to an ABC Australia report on March 3, first, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions on the number of goods purchased, stating that they do not plan to do so.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including medical masks, hand sanitizers, galantry, handwashing and flour.
Similarly, in addition to the events in Australia, on Sunday evening it was noticed that the online store of the British supermarket Ocado also limited the sale of Andres toilet paper with two packages of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization Declares COVID-19 Pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of the infectious disease COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” only describes the extent of the disease and not the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that national governments need to take action:
“All countries together are still able to influence the course of the pandemic.”
This is possible if countries are engaged in the detection, testing, treatment, isolation, monitoring of cases of the disease, as well as mobilization of their citizens,” said WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and severity of the disease and the alarming level of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is “unprecedented.”
He said in an interview broadcast on CNN in February that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been tracked since its inception until its continued global spread.”
Mr. Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coronavirus.
Nor have we ever seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”
First, in January, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern and then granted it a new status – a pandemic.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak: “This is just the beginning, it will get worse.”
According to the Associated Press, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 were reported worldwide on Thursday, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic is the current coronavirus pandemic of 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and an international public health emergency was declared on January 30, 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The death rate in China is 4%, while in the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Currently, no vaccine or specific treatment has been found.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering the mouth with a cough, observing the distance between people, identifying and ensuring self-isolation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantine measures, curfews, controlling workplace risks and closing various facilities.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic consequences, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of goods exacerbated by panic buying.
Schools and universities were closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of students worldwide.
There have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against citizens of China, other citizens of East and South-East Asia, or people who resemble them externally, as well as against other groups of people living in areas where there have been significant cases of the virus.
As a result of reduced travel and the closure of heavy industry enterprises, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On December 31, 2019, the health authorities of Wuhan (the capital of Hubei province), China, reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause, and an investigation into the situation was launched in early January 2020.
The cases were mainly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, so the virus is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a newly discovered virus that has great similarities to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. It was later discovered that the very first case of the disease occurred on December 1, 2019, and the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two-thirds of cases reported in December 2019 were related to this market.
On March 13, 2020, in the publication of the South China branch of the Morning Post newspaper, the information of which is not verified, it was suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei province on November 17, 2019. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China decreased, but began to rise unexpectedly in Italy, Iran and South Korea.
The number of cases of the disease can be significantly underestimated, in particular, due to the number of cases with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection had been reported among young people, with patients aged 19 and under accounting for less than 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Wallance estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected until effective group immunity in the country’s population was formed.
The statistics include cases of infection of people who have been tested for COVID-19, and whose test turned out to be positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has been able to check more than 3% of its population, and many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, have adopted an official policy that prescribes not to test for only minor symptoms.
The study, published on March 16, found that in China, up to January 23, 86 percent of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and that such unregistered patients had become the source of infection for 79 percent of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on March 30 showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy was significantly higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of baseline reproductive infection number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests that this figure could be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 recover well.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period - 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of deaths had comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official COVID-19 mortality data usually include deaths of patients with positive COVID test results performed according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, as official figures may not take into account deceased people who have not been tested – for example, in the event of death at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Incomplete data on Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official figures for COVID by 4-5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admits: “We know that [the reported death toll] is lower than the actual one.” His words are confirmed by reports of some isolated cases in the U.S. Such incomplete records are often found in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic of January 2009. The first confirmed death was recorded in Uha in 2020.
The first death outside mainland China was recorded on 1 February in the Philippines, and outside Asia on 14 February in France.
By February 28, more than a dozen deaths had been recorded outside mainland China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents except Antarctica had reported deaths. Several methods were commonly used to quantify mortality.
All indicators vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease; they are also affected by testing volumes, quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, time since the onset of the disease and population parameters such as age, gender and overall health. The “mortality/disease rate” represents the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases of infection over a given interval.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 10, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204).
The data varies from region to region.
In China, the mortality to morbidity ratio of non-infected patients decreased from 17.3% (for those who had symptoms on January 1-10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those who had symptoms after February 1, 2020). Other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR) — the percentage of diagnosed patients who die from the disease, and the mortality rate from the I.R.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of certain populations from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to estimates by the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, the mortality rate from this pandemic as a whole ranges from 0.1 to 0.39%.
The top figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first random COVID-19 testing in Germany, as well as a statistical study analyzing the impact of testing on CFR scores.
The WHO says the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and exact duration of the flash cannot be determined and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni, an employee of the University of Pennsylvania, argues that “uncontrolled infectious outbreaks tend to reach the plateau, and then when the number of available carriers of the disease ends, they begin to fade.
However, in the current situation, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction as to when this will happen.”
Zhong Nanshan, a senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, said “everything could end by June” if all countries were able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 “will circulate, perhaps within a year or two.”
According to a study conducted by the Imperial College under the guidance of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is created (possibly 18 months or more),” physical distancing and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a researcher at Vanderbilt University, said: “I don’t think this coronavirus is ever going to go away forever because it’s so easily transmitted,” and that it “can turn into a seasonal disease, flaring up every year.”
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively non-specific, and some infected people can tolerate the disease without symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, the formation of sputum in the airways (slipping), loss of smell, shortness of breath, pain in muscles and joints, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, bleedin', diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO claims to get sick in serious form with the development of breathing problems each person.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such urgent symptoms as difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of depression in the chest, a sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips. In the presence of these symptoms, you should immediately seek medical help. Further development of the disease can lead to severe
In some infected people, the disease can be asymptomatic, without any clinical manifestations, but the results of tests confirm the fact of infection, so doctors recommend placing people in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed, under strict control and examination for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of asymptomatic course of the disease ranges from a few units to 44% of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. There is no complete clarity on the symptom of loss of smell: according to initial estimates, the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was initially 30%, and then fell to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still unknown.
It is believed that the disease is mainly transmitted during close contact, as well as through small drops released into the air together with coughing, sneezing or during conversation; close contact means contact within a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance of 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets emitted into the air during a conversation, which are able to remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory drops can also be formed during exhalation, including during a conversation, although the virus is usually not transmitted through the air.
Drops can get into the mouth or nose of nearby people, as well as into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if a person touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, followed by touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
There are also concerns that the virus may be transmitted through faeces, but the risk of this method of transmission is considered low.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread can occur both before the onset of symptoms and in the later stages of the disease.
There have been cases where the tests were positive in testing three days before the onset of symptoms, and this suggests the possibility of transmitting the virus before the symptoms are pronounced.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed cases of asymptomatic disease, but contact tracing studies have also identified cases of transmission from asymptomatic carriers in some countries.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on surfaces from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (304) the virus can live up to three days, on a cardboard surface - for one day, and on copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These data, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature. In domestic and other animals, a positive result was obtained for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals, just as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be touched by infected people.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases reported in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature in related coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with household soap, which dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 has a great resemblance to the original SARS-CoV virus.
It is believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis of the coronavirus has shown that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, a subgenre of the Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of bat viruses.
At the whole genomic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in the amino acids of certain parts of the genome sequences of pangolin viruses and humans.
A complete genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest percentage of similarity (92%) exists between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts of the virus.
Infection with the virus can be pre-diagnosed based on symptoms, although this should eventually be confirmed by a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of the infected secretion or by computed tomography.
The results of a study comparing the PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has issued a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19.”
The WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on January 17.
Testing for polymerase chain reaction in real time (RT-PCR) is carried out.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.
Results are usually ready within a period of several hours to several days.
Usually, a nasopharyngeal smear is used for the test, although a yawn smear can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serological tests to detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of them proved accurate enough to obtain approval for ubiquitous use.
In the U.S., a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for use in emergencies only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of the visualization of symptoms on X-rays and computed tomography (CT) include asymmetrical peripheral opacities by the type of frosted glass and the absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for compiling an international database of images of confirmed cases of infection.
Due to similarities with other infections, such as adenovirus, when identifying COVID-19, images not confirmed by PCR tests have limited clinical specificity.
In China, a large study was conducted comparing chest CT results and PCR testing, and it was found that while the images are less specific in case of infection, they can be deciphered faster; moreover, they are more sensitive, and therefore this diagnostic method can be considered as a screening tool in infected areas.
To diagnose the virus using X-rays and computed tomography were developed convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands, using coughing or sneezing napkins that should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in crowded places.
In order to prevent transmission of the disease, it is also recommended to physically distance themselves from people. Many Governments recommend refraining from any non-urgent travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
However, the virus was able to spread to most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread among the population, some members of which do not know where and how they were infected. Medical professionals caring for patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, as well as precautions when contacting other people and means of eye protection. Contact tracking is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of its infection and to determine the source of its infection.
Governments’ use of citizens’ location data using their mobile phones for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and organizations such as Amnesty International, as well as more than 100 other organizations, have issued statements demanding that this type of surveillance be restricted.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams have been working on developing solutions to ensure the confidentiality of personal data – for example, recording user proximity to other mobile phones using Bluetooth technology.
If a mobile phone user has been in close contact with a person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he receives the appropriate notification. There are also unfounded versions of how to prevent infection - for example, rinsing the nose and mouth, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to create it.
In order to prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends washing hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating, after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
This is necessary because, being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell.
In addition, if soap and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of at least 60%.
WHO recommends people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with dirty hands.
Surfaces can be disinfected with a number of solutions (the stainless steel surface disinfectant begins to act a minute after application) with a content of 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% povidone iodine.
Other components, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in the event of a suspicion or confirmation of COVID in an institution such as an office or day hospital, all spaces of such premises, including offices, toilets, common areas, electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend that when coughing or sneezing, cover the mouth and nose with the back of the elbow or napkin and immediately throw away used hygiene items.
Those who may have been infected are advised to use medical masks, as using a mask may limit the volume and range of exhalation products that disperse in the air when talking, sneezing, and coughing.
The WHO has issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, “Using a medical mask can reduce people’s tendency to touch their faces, and touching their faces with dirty hands is the primary method of infection.” Masks are also recommended for those who care for people who may be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, such as those who care for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that using a mask does indeed reduce the number of face touches.
Several countries have begun to call for the use of medical masks in public places.
CDC Centers, USA, recommend wearing tissue face masks for non-medical use. China separately stressed the importance of using disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand are urging people to make face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are forbidden to go outside without masks covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, the Vietnamese government asked all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered all food shop visitors to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel has also asked citizens to wear masks in public places.
On April 1, Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are produced per day since mid-March, was ordered to use medical masks for all passengers on trains and long-distance buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask when outdoors; those residents who are unable to purchase masks have been advised to sew them themselves at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by residents of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts between people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, closures of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters and shopping malls.
People can use social distancing measures by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded places, using contactless greetings, and physically distancing themselves from others.
Many governments in the regions, particularly those heavily affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distancing.
The maximum number of people that can gather in one place, according to the recommendation of U.S. government bodies and health organizations, was quickly reduced from 250 people (in regions where there was no data on the spread of COVID-19), to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany forbade gathering into groups involving more than two people. Older people and individuals suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and a weakened immune system began to limit the use of these drugs. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if there is an outbreak of the disease in the region.
The use of the term “social distancing” was understood in such a way that people should be subjected to complete social isolation, instead of staying in contact with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies have published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during a pandemic.
Among other things, recommendations were given to have sex only with your regular partners, with whom you live, and in whom you are sure that he does not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who suspect they are infected are advised to self-isolate at home.
Health institutions have published detailed instructions for proper self-isolation. Governments of many countries have also imposed mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas quarantine themselves.
Persons in high-risk groups were prescribed the strictest quarantine.
Individuals who may have been in contact with COVID-19-infected people, or have recently visited a country or region largely affected by the epidemic, have been advised to be quarantined within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Strategies to combat the outbreak include curbing the spread of the disease, suppressing or mitigating it.
The containment of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and is aimed at tracking and isolating the infected, as well as other infectious control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts are being made to mitigate the consequences: measures are being taken to slow the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to contain and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken simultaneously.
Suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of infections to below 1. Part of the effort to manage the outbreak of infectious disease is aimed at reducing the epidemic peak, known as the alignment of the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and give more time to develop vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include self-prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of medical masks, and self-isolation; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and canceling mass events; engaging the community to assist in the implementation of such measures and participating in them; and measures to protect the environment, such as
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
In South Korea, mass screening and localized quarantines were introduced, as well as a warning system for the movements of infected persons.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to infected individuals in self-isolation and heavy fines were imposed on those who did not.
In Taiwan, increased production of medical masks and fines for the accumulation of excess stocks of medicines. Modeling in the UK and the US showed that there are serious problems in terms of mitigating (deceleration, but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppressing (stopping the growth of the epidemic).
An optimal policy to mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3, and mortality by half, but still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be the preferred method, but it should be used as long as the virus circulates among the population (or as long as a vaccine is not developed if it happens earlier), otherwise the spread of the disease will quickly resume when the measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to contain the pandemic is at a social and economic cost.
Antiviral drugs approved for the treatment of COVID-19 currently do not exist, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medications, drinking enough fluids, and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid administration, and respiratory support.
The use of steroid drugs can only harm.
Several compounds that have previously been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also being considered for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO also reported that some “traditional and home remedies” may alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and health-care adaptation to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a major response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for clinics and primary health care services to help redistribute resources at several levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, eliminating non-urgent procedures where possible, detecting the virus and isolating patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as empowering patients with intensive care.
There are various theories about where the very first case of infection could have occurred – the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronavirus infection probably took place on December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei province gradually increased.
Mainly they were associated with the wholesale market of seafood in Huang'an, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus penetrated into the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On December 26, a case of mass pneumonia of unknown origin was reported in the Hubei Provincial Clinic, with which Dr. Zhang Tian worked.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Clinic warned their colleagues about “a coronavirus similar to SARS.”
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenlian, were warned by police about responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ai Feng, was reprimanded by her superiors for panicking.
Later, on December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission published a public notice and informed WHO about the situation.
Wuhan health authorities reported a number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which turned out to be large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, helped by Chinese New Year holidays and the fact that Wuhan is a transport and main railway hub.
On January 20, China reported 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
According to later official data, by January 20, 2020, symptoms of the disease had already appeared in 6,174 people. As of March 26, the United States overtook China and Italy for the largest number of confirmed cases of infection in the world. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases of infection were registered worldwide, more than 97,000 people died, and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded case of infection.
Due to the pandemic, many European Schengen countries have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to contain the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as mandatory home stay, mandatory shelter or isolation), as well as curfew. As of April 2, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population of the United States, were on any form of quarantine, more than 50 million people are on isolation in the Philippines, about 59 million people are in isolation in the Philippines.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later this figure increased to 2.6 billion people - about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on December 1, 2019; according to another report, the accuracy of which has not been verified, this date is November 17.
On December 26, Zhang Jixiang worked with a case of mass pneumonia of unknown type, about which on December 27, her clinic notified the Jianghan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Wuhan.
Primary genetic testing of patient samples, which took place on December 27, 2019, showed the presence of SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
The WHO was notified the same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Wuhan about the responsibility for “spreading rumors” about the outbreak.
The Chinese National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no “clear evidence” of the newly discovered virus’ ability to transmit from person to person.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign to contain the spread of the virus, which was later described by the Communist Party of China Secretary General Xi Jinping as a “people’s war.”
The events of the “largest quarantine in the history of mankind” began to unfold, on January 23, a sanitary border was announced and a ban on entry to Wuhan and back, later this measure spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei province and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The city has banned the use of personal transport.
In many places, celebrations on the occasion of the Chinese New Year (January 25) have been canceled.
Authorities also announced the construction of the temporary Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital was built, Leishenshan, which received other incoming patients.
In addition to newly built hospitals, China has also repurposed 14 other institutions in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government took additional measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, including issuing health certificates for travelers and extending the Chinese New Year celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed across the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions of China, the authorities have introduced a remote mode of operation.
Travel restrictions were imposed in Hubei province and beyond.
The schedule of public transport was changed, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
In many cities, a citizen movement control regime has been introduced, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have faced some form of outdoor movement restrictions. After the outbreak entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the “import” of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has introduced a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international travelers entering the city. As of March 23, only one case of transmission of infection inside the country was registered in mainland China, which occurred five days earlier, in this case from a person who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On March 24, 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang reported that the spread of the disease transmitted domestically had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been brought under control.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubei, other than Wuhan, were lifted, this happened two months after the province was closed for quarantine. On March 26, 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry for persons with a visa or residence permit would be suspended from March 28. The exact dates for the cancellation of this order were not specified.
Those wishing to travel to China will be required to apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
On March 30, the Chinese government called on businesses and factories to resume operations and provided companies with cash-to-credit stimulus packages. On April 4, at 10:00 a national three-minute re-silence was held, which opened the day of mourning for the victims of the coronavirus, announced by the State Council of the country and coincided with the holiday of Quinmin, however, the central government asked citizens to give in.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 spread to South Korea on January 20, 2020 from China.
On February 20, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of the disease, largely due to the fact that a large number of followers of the new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shinchonji gathered in Taegu.
Shincheonji's followers arrived in Daegu from Wuhan, which is believed to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, out of 9,336 church followers, 1,261 (approximately 13%) reported having symptoms of the disease. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was declared in South Korea.
On February 28, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, and on February 29, this figure increased to 3,150.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
The outbreak affected the number of trips, therefore, the flight schedule of the airlines was changed. South Korea has deployed a program to screen the population for the presence of the virus, track contacts and organize quarantine measures for contact persons. This program is considered the largest and best in terms of its organization worldwide.
Screening methods included mandatory reporting of symptoms via a mobile app to all those arriving from abroad, general testing for the virus, the results of which were ready the next day, as well as expanding testing capabilities, allowing up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered successful in fighting the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that it did not isolate entire cities. Initially, South Korean society was divided due to the reaction of President Moon Jae-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for Mr. Moon to be impeached for the government's inadequate response to the outbreak.
On March 23, it was reported that South Korea had the lowest total number of infections in a single day for four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that from 1 April, all newly arrived from abroad will be placed under a two-week quarantine.
According to media reports, on April 1, 121 countries applied to South Korea for help in testing for the virus.
On February 19, Iran reported the first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later in the day.
The first measures introduced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural and sporting events, Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated 5 trillion rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on February 26, 2020 that the government does not plan to quarantine entire areas affected by the outbreak, but only individuals will be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit intercity travel, but intensive movement between cities before the Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China in February.
Against the backdrop of allegations of concealment of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, by February 28, more than ten countries linked their cases to Iran, indicating that the scale of the outbreak there may be more serious than the 388 cases registered by the Iranian government on that date.
Iran’s parliament was shut down, and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on March 3, tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch called on the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, as well as to temporarily release all prisoners eligible for this category.
The organization states that there is an increased risk of the virus spreading in closed institutions, such as prisons, where there is a lack of adequate medical care.
On March 15, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
By March 17, at least 12 current or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died of the disease.
By March 23, Iran had registered 50 new coronavirus cases every hour and one new coronavirus death every ten minutes.
According to the WHO representative, the incidence rate in Iran may be five times higher than the data reported at the official level.
It is also assumed that the US sanctions against Iran may affect the financial capabilities of the country in terms of protection against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions against countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On January 31, it was confirmed that the disease hit the territory of Italy, when two Chinese tourists tested for SARS-CoV-2, made in Rome, gave a positive result.
The number of cases has increased rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-associated cluster of COVID-19 cases was later discovered. It all began with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree-law on containment of the outbreak, according to which more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: “The entry to and exit from the outbreak zone will be blocked.
In these areas, it has already been ordered to suspend businesses and cancel sporting events.” On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the closure of all schools and universities across the country, as 100 people had already been recorded dead in Italy at the time.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but all sporting events were postponed for at least one month on March 9.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of almost all commercial activities and the closure of businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations on medical ethics regarding protocols to set the priority of providing patients with medical care, which may have to be used.
On March 19, Italy overtook China for the coronavirus death rate, ranking first in the world after announcing 3,405 deaths.
On March 22, it became known that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, Italy had 128,948 confirmed coronavirus cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovery cases, the majority of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report noted that such a high mortality rate in Italy can be facilitated by a combination of two factors – a large number of elderly citizens of this country and the lack of opportunity to examine everyone who is currently suffering from the coronavirus.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus most calmly from all affected countries, and until March 18, 2020, the British government did not oblige citizens to observe any form of social distancing or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government was criticized for not reacting quickly enough and seriously to the danger faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement recommending that all non-essential travel and social contacts should be avoided, suggesting that people should work from home as much as possible and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theaters.
On March 20, the government announced that all entertainment establishments, such as pubs and sports clubs, should close as soon as possible, and promised working citizens to pay a maximum of 80% of the salary, but not more than <0xC2><0xA3>2,500 per month as a measure to support the population during the crisis. On March 23, the prime minister announced stricter measures on social distancing and banned the two-person trains from gathering.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were introduced with the involvement of the police, the introduction of fines and the dispersal of crowds.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of businesses that provide “people’s livelihoods,” including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, grocery stores, gas stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. government’s leading public health organization, announced that it had developed its own test kit.
Despite this, testing of the population in the United States was not started immediately, and as a result, the true extent of the outbreak during this period was hidden.
Testing was hampered by the lack of test kits issued by the federal government in February, the lack of permission by the federal government to use non-state test kits developed by scientific organizations, various companies and clinics, as well as restrictive criteria before early March that would allow citizens to pass the test (this could only be done by appointment of a doctor).
The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States by February 27.
The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been conducted by March 13.
On March 22, the Associated Press reported: “Many patients, even with symptoms and a doctor’s appointment, waited for their queue for tests for hours or days.” After the first case of coronavirus death in the United States was reported from Washington state on February 29, Governor Jay Insley declared a state of emergency, which was also soon declared by other states.
Classes were canceled at Seattle schools on March 3, and schools were closed nationwide by mid-March. On March 6, 2020, a team of epidemiologists at Imperial College, London, informed the United States of forecasts of the impact of the new coronavirus on the country.
On the same day, President Trump signed into law the Law on Additional Provisions for Preparedness and Response to the Coronavirus, according to which the federal authorities were provided emergency assistance in the amount of $ 8.3 billion to respond to the outbreak.
Corporations imposed travel restrictions on employees, canceled conferences, and encouraged employees to work from home.
Sports events and seasons have been canceled. On March 11, Trump announced restrictions on travel to most of Europe, with the exception of the UK, for 30 days starting March 13.

On March 25, the governor said social distancing was likely an effective measure, as estimates of doubling the number of cases dropped from 2.0 to 4.7 days.
As of 28 March, 32,308 cases were registered in New York City and 672 people died. It was reported that on 26 March, more confirmed cases of coronavirus were registered in the United States than in any other country in the world, including China and Italy. As of 8 April, 400,335 cases were confirmed in the United States of America, 12,841 died.

On April 3, 884 deaths from the coronavirus were recorded in the United States within 24 hours.
In New York State, as of April 3, the number of cases exceeded 100,000. The White House has been criticized for underestimating the threat and censoring information coming to the public, controlling, through the office of Vice President Mike Pence, public statements and publications of health officials and scientists related to the virus.
In general, the opinions of supporters of President Trump about how successfully he manages to cope with the crisis, divided.
Some officials and observers have criticized the U.S.’s dependence on imports of critical materials, including essentials, from China.
In mid-January 2020, Travel Medicine published an analysis of air travel patterns that were used to map and predict patterns of disease spread.
According to information from the International Air Transport Association for 2018, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Taipei received the largest number of travelers from Wuhan.
Dubai, Sydney and Melbourne were also considered popular destinations for these tourists.
Of the 20 most popular tourist routes, Bali has been named least prepared for an outbreak of the disease, while Australian cities are considered the most prepared. On 7 February, Australia adopted its contingency plan related to the new coronavirus (COVID-19).
In this regard, it is said that much remains to be learned about COVID-19 and that Australia will pay particular attention to border controls and communications in a situation of threat.
On March 21, a human biosafety emergency was declared in Australia.
Thanks to effective quarantine measures in the public transport sector in Wuhan and Hubei, some countries planned to evacuate their citizens and diplomatic staff from the area, mainly through charter flights of their home countries, to which the Chinese authorities gave their permission.

On February 15, the United States announced that it would evacuate U.S. citizens aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.
On February 21, a plane carrying 129 Canadian passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess landed in Trenton, Ontario.
In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways plane chartered by the South African government took off with 112 South African citizens on board.
Before the flight, a medical examination of passengers was carried out, and four South Africans who were found to have signs of the coronavirus were left in China to reduce the risk.
Only South Africans with negative coronavirus tests were evacuated.
The analyses were taken from all South African citizens, including flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers participating in the humanitarian mission, and they were all under surveillance and quarantined for 14 days at The Ranch Resort as a precaution.

Businessman Jack Ma sent to the African Union, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 1.1 million test kits, 6 million medical masks and 60,000 protective suits for the organization to distribute to its member states.
He later also sent 5,000 test kits, 100,000 medical masks, and five IVL devices to Panama.
Ma also donated drugs to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about medical masks and kits for testing Chinese production.
For example, Spain recalled 58,000 Chinese coronavirus testing kits, providing accuracy of only up to 30%, and the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese medical masks.
Belgium also recalled 100,000 unsuitable medical masks: they were supposed to have been made in China, but it later turned out that they came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched relief operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and contain the spread of the infection.
WHO noted a clear difference between the situation with the outbreak of atypical pneumonia, which took place in 2002-2004, during which the Chinese authorities were accused of secreting information that allegedly prevented the prevention of the disease and curbing its spread, on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the central government "regularly provides
In response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a ban on transportation in Wuhan in 2009, WHO representative Goden Galea noted that while "this measure was definitely not recommended by WHO", it is also "a very important confirmation of the implementation of the obligation to contain the epidemic in the place of the greatest spread", and called it "unprecedented in the history of public health".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said the announcement was due to “the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries that do not have reliable health systems.
Commenting on travel restrictions, Mr Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that unduly impede international displacement and trade” and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement.”
On February 5, WHO asked the world community to allocate $675 million to provide strategic preparedness for the epidemic in low-income countries, reporting on the need to provide emergency assistance to those countries that “do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, despite the fact that the epidemic has not yet reached these countries.”
Mr. Tedros also said that “the indicator of our readiness is the degree of preparedness for the epidemic of our weakest link”, and called on the international community to “make a choice: invest today or pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease – COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres had agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem.”
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Group has been set up to coordinate all United Nations responses; these steps, WHO says, will allow “to focus on health responses, while other agencies can use their expertise to combat the outbreak in a broader social and economic sense.”
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated the establishment of a joint ad hoc group, which provided the work of international experts and WHO staff on the ground in China to help resolve the situation within the country and assess the "seriousness of the disease and its contagion", organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess the "effectiveness of response measures at the level of provinces and districts including
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the likelihood of global spread of the coronavirus would be increased from “high” to “very high” – the highest degree of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of WHO’s Health Emergencies Programme, warned in a statement: “This is a test of every government on the planet for real-world preparedness: it’s time to act.
This virus may be on its way to your country, and you need to be prepared,” he said, adding that correct responses could help the world avoid a “worst-case scenario.”
Ryan also said that the current data does not serve as a basis for declaring the global pandemic as a public health official, and added that declaring the pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that every person on the planet will be at risk of contracting this virus.”
On March 11, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic.
The WHO Director-General stated that WHO is “deeply concerned about both the alarmingly high prevalence and severity of the disease and the equally alarming level of inaction in relation to this problem.” WHO has been severely criticized for being considered inadequate to the concept of a pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
In response to the situation, a petition was filed against the Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adanom, with a proposal to resign, which was signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On March 26, 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting everyone’s rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone had the right to life-saving measures against him, and the Government was responsible for organizing such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should in no way justify discrimination against a particular group of people.
The experts stressed that everyone has the right to health protection, including persons with disabilities, representatives of minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, the homeless, citizens living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of public support.
International governmental organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and recommendations.
The digital hub provides information on country policy measures to strengthen health systems and the global economy, address quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and promote coordinated global responses to the coronavirus.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, British Cabinet Minister Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for their efforts to fight the pandemic that began in Hubei province.
A number of provincial-level leaders of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been fired for the quarantine measures they have taken in central China, and these layoffs have shown dissatisfaction with the political establishment’s response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party Secretary General Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijiang, disagreed with the earlier statement that the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The administration of US President Donald Trump called the coronavirus a “Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus”, saying that “censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic”, and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who argue that such an approach is racist and “distracts from the US administration’s inability to spread the disease”.
The Daily Beast got access to a U.S. government telegram that contained a communications strategy trick apparently devised by the National Security Council, with such references to the strategy: “It’s all about China.
We are asked to disseminate this information by any means possible, including press conferences and televised speeches.” Organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China’s efforts to help countries suffering from the virus are part of a “propaganda push” to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the struggle for influence through PR and the so-called policy of generosity.”
Borrell also said that “China is persistently promoting the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States.”
China also called on the US to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports sending aid to the last two countries.
Jack Ma’s donation of 100,000 medical masks to Cuba came under a ban in connection with the US sanctions imposed on April 3.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of diverting aid intended for other countries to their own country.
With regard to medical masks, disputes also arose between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has appropriated hundreds of IVL vehicles intended for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the lack of support from the European Union for the coronavirus-covered Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italy’s ambassador to the EU, said: “Only China has reacted bilaterally.
This is clearly not a sign of European solidarity.”
On March 22, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin arranged to send Russian military paramedics, specialized disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous “high-level political source” as saying that 80% of Russian aid was “useless or of little use to Italy.”
The source accused Russia of seeking to make a favorable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
Lombardy President Attilio Fontana and Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media attacks and thanked them for their assistance.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “By offering assistance to our American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase the pace of production, they will also be able to provide retaliatory assistance if necessary.”
NATO’s Defender 2020 military exercise, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states – NATO’s largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War – will be held in a reduced format.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson also criticized the exercise Defender 2020 (Defender 2020) ": "In the crisis situation that has developed today in the field of public health, the holding of these exercises threatens the lives of not only the US military and many European countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such events should be held." The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus.
On March 14, 2020, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in an open letter appealed to world leaders for help, reporting that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to the sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran. The epidemic generated calls for the United States to adopt social policies, including those common in other prosperous countries.
Politicians expected that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Due to the pandemic, diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated.
South Korea has criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine measures" after Japan announced that any citizen arriving from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks in places specifically designated by the government.
South Korean society initially split because of President Moon Jae-in’s reaction to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either praised the president's actions or called for impeachment of Mr. Moon for the government's inadequate response to the outbreak, and the pandemic has forced countries to pass emergency laws as a response.
Some commentators expressed concern that the move would allow Governments to strengthen their authority.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Viktor Orban the indefinite right to govern by decree, suspend parliament, and hold elections and punish those accused of spreading fake information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been cited as the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, the purchase of goods in panic and disruptions in production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruptions in suppliers.
In several settlements, panic shopping also took place; this led to a situation where essential goods such as food, toilet paper and bottled water disappeared from store shelves, which in turn led to a shortage of supplies.
In particular, the technology industry warns of delays in the supply of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This jump led to a 20-fold increase in prices compared to the usual price, as well as delays in the delivery of medical products by four to six months.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO has warned that health workers will be hit for this reason.
In Australia, due to the pandemic, buyers under the daigou system received a new opportunity to sell Australian goods to China.
This led to a shortage of baby food in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, as well as the high demand for food, acute food shortages were avoided in both areas.
Measures taken by China and Italy against stockpiling and trafficking of critically important products, which have proved successful, have avoided the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, which has small-scale agricultural production, has not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry representatives, agricultural prices may rise.
The shelves of grocery stores remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials provided access to pork stockpiles to ensure full nutrition of the population.
Similar laws requiring food producers to preserve food supplies in the event of an emergency exist in Italy.
The damage to the global economy has affected China: According to media data from March 16, China’s economy suffered heavily in the first two months of 2020 due to government-sponsored measures to combat the spread of the virus, resulting in a 20.5 percent drop in retail sales.
Mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center; therefore, it is believed that the virus outbreak poses a serious destabilizing threat to the global economy.
According to forecasts by Agate Demaray, an employee of the Economist Intelligence Unit, volatility in the markets will continue until a clearer picture of the potential results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current epidemic in terms of global growth could outweigh the impact of the 2002-2004 Atypical Pneumonia epidemic.
According to one estimate made by an expert from Washington University in St. Louis, the damage to the global supply chain could exceed $300 billion, and the negative impact could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said it was taking “urgent measures” following a sharp decline in oil prices due to falling demand from China.
On February 24, global stock markets collapsed due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various U.S. stock indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500, and the Dow Jones index for industrial stocks, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, with the Dow index falling 1,191 points — the biggest one-day decline since the 2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than a 10% drop.
On February 28, the agency Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China’s sovereign credit rating, but retained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again due to concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, and the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many believe that there is a possibility of an economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and states.
Central banks are responding faster than they were during the 2008 financial crisis.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations not to take any trips.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines canceled flights due to a sharp decline in the demand for air tickets, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The negative impact on the cruise line industry has proven to be stronger than ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chun-yun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year celebrations.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events involving a large number of people, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies have also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many New Year's events were canceled and tourist attractions were closed to prevent mass gatherings of people; for example, Beijing closed the Forbidden City and abolished traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China’s 31 provinces, municipalities and districts, authorities extended the New Year holidays until February 10, instructing most businesses not to open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling New Year's Eve celebrations. The retail sector has suffered on a global scale: store opening hours have been reduced and some stores have been temporarily closed.
Visits to retail outlets in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East reduced sales by 50-60%.
As a result, in March, the attendance of shopping centers fell by 33-43% compared to February.
Operators of shopping malls around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improving sanitary conditions, installing equipment to check the temperature of visitors and canceling activities. According to an assessment by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic can leave 14-22 million more people behind the poverty line than it would be in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, at the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Many of China’s 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves at home in their country’s provinces or locked up in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the government for help.
According to estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in the United States, the coronavirus outbreak of 900% in March could also deprive 47 million people of their jobs, and the unemployment rate could reach 32%. Self-isolation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed, receiving a daily fee. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute, showed that the 4
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million British workers applied for a single social benefit. Almost half a million companies in Germany transferred their employees to government-subsidized reduced working hours — part-time.
The German part-time pay scheme was also introduced in France and the UK.
The arts and cultural heritage areas have also been severely affected by the pandemic, which has affected the activities of organizations as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations have sought to support their (often state-funded) mission of ensuring access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the safety of their employees and the public, and, where possible, supporting the people of the arts.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions worldwide were closed indefinitely, or access to them was restricted to varying degrees, and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed to other dates.
In return, active efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and growing consequence of the spread of the virus is the abolition of religious services, major sports events and other public events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the events of Holy Week in Rome, which are held in the last week of the Christian penitential period - Lent.
Many dioceses recommend that older Christians stay at home and do not attend services on Sundays; in some churches, church services have begun to be broadcast on radio, live, or television, while the leaders of some churches offer to hold outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome closed its churches, chapels and St. Peter's Square, where Christian pilgrims no longer appeared, and later other religious organizations also canceled worship services and restricted access to public worship in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and burghers.
Iran’s health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the coronavirus outbreak and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia banned foreign pilgrims and its own residents from accessing the holy sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019–20 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The coronavirus outbreak also disrupted plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin in late July; on March 24, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be "postponed to the period after 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021". Casinos and other gambling establishments around the world were closed, and poker tournaments, which were usually also live streamed, were either rescheduled or rescheduled.
This has led many players to switch to online mode, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as various music groups have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many major theaters, such as Broadway, also canceled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results on the Internet, organizing live online concerts or web festivals; this helps people of creative professions continue to perform, release or publish their works.
There are a lot of internet memes on the topic of coronavirus, many of which are humorous and smooth out the alarming moods characteristic of periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in bias, xenophobia and racism towards Chinese citizens and people of East Asian descent, as well as representatives of the population of hotspots in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February information reports (when most cases were still confined to China) recorded racist sentiments expressed in various groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received fair retribution for anything.
In some African countries, anti-Chinese sentiment has also increased.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Citizens of China, as well as its residents who live in the affected areas, were supported both offline and online.
The epidemic began to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; in this regard, citizens of such regions can also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed a petition in early stages with their bans.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChineseDon'tComeJapan) held a leading position on Twitter.
Citizens of China, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report a growing level of racist sentiment and even attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a “Chinese virus”; critics see it as racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens evacuated from Wuhan to Novye Sanzhary.
Students coming from northeastern India’s bordering China and studying in major cities in India have reported cases of persecution linked to the coronavirus outbreak.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s State Unit, West Bengal, said the Chinese had destroyed nature and “that’s why God took revenge on them.”
Later, these statements received condemnation from the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "misleading". In China, because of the pandemic, xenophobia and racism against residents who are not Chinese citizens again broke out: foreigners began to be called "foreign garbage" and objects subject to "recycling".
Many newspapers with paid access to information have removed such restrictions for some or all areas affected by the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have published their scientific articles on the coronavirus outbreak.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to the results of their research on preprint publishing servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing of respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods to detect the presence of the virus and methods to detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by OT-PCR, which recognizes the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and is intended only for detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm fairly recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnostic and population control purposes.
Antibody tests reveal the number of people who have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too minor to go to the hospital or absent at all.
The exact mortality rate from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined by the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to limited testing capabilities, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By March 23, no country had been able to verify more than 3% of its population, and information on the number of tests conducted in different countries is highly contradictory.
Such discrepancies in data are likely to have a significant impact on recorded mortality rates, which in some countries may be greatly exaggerated.
With the real-time polymerase reverse transcription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on samples from the respiratory tract obtained in various ways, including a nasopharyngeal smear or sputum sample.
Results are usually available over a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test performed on swabs taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus can disappear from the throat, continuing, however, to multiply in the lungs.
In infected patients tested in the second week of the disease, as an alternative, material from the lower respiratory tract can be taken with a suction catheter, or you can use products of expectoration (sprout).
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Charité Clinic, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis of 250,000 sets that were subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By January 23, 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On January 28, 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR clinical level (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It reveals the gene "E", common to all beta-Coronoviruses, and the RdRp gene specific to SARS-CoV. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies to have received permission from the National Medicines Administration of China for emergency use of a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
One in three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to defective reagents and a narrow testing area conducted by the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using the two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and only after that date were state and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The testing was approved by the Food and Drug Administration as part of an emergency authorisation. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection based on RT-PCR across the country.
Quest Diagnostics has started testing for COVID-19 nationwide since March 9, 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of the analyses must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Vector State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. It was reported that on March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of the test, which can be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large volume of samples, allowing one machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott laboratories for testing the Abbott m2000 system; previously, the FDA issued similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also receives an EUA from the FDA for a test duration of about 45 minutes.
The FDA has also approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of cycles of alternating temperatures, this method can reveal positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 such machines in the US, and Abbott plans to increase production to 50,000 tests per day. Currently, a monoclonal antibody test is being developed in Taiwan, which specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, and there is hope for the possibility of obtaining results in 15-20 minutes, similar to an express test.
A March 2020 review of the specialized literature concludes that “breast X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT [computer tomography] results may have that value even before symptoms appear.”
Typical features detected during CT include double-sided multi-lenght subpleural sealing foci of the “matte glass” type with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, the symptom of the cobblestone bridge, and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods used in Wuhan at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, as many of its imaging functions coincide with other processes for pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for screening or as a first-line test method in the diagnosis of COVID-19”. As of March 2020, the CDC recommends using the PCR method for initial screening.
Part of the immune response to infection is expressed in the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infection in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population control purposes. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by on-site diagnosis (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-performance automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each such system.
In CLT, one sample of peripheral blood is usually used, although serial samples may also be used to track the immune response.
In PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by piercing the skin.
Unlike PCR methods, a blood sampling stage is not required for sampling. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 organizations that have undergone all the necessary registration procedures and can now spread their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, the FDA has approved only one emergency use permit test. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for the use of their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies in blood samples that have the ability to fight the virus.
The performance of testing is several hundred samples over several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR analysis of viral RNA.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after infection. At the beginning of April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had acquired produced satisfactory results.
In Hong Kong, a scheme has been developed that allows patients with suspected cases of COVID-19 to remain at home: "emergency department staff use the patient's test tube for the sample", the patient spits into it, gives it back and after some time receives the test results. The British NHS has announced the launch of its pilot scheme for testing suspicious cases at home, which eliminates the risk of infection.
Express testing centers helped South Korea organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures than any other country. On 2 March in Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians said it was ready to conduct about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient settings, and a week earlier they were able to do only 10,700 tests per week.
If the examination is prescribed by a doctor, then the costs are covered by health insurance.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s total test performance is 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, it was proposed to conduct express testing in several major cities.
As of March 26, 2020, the total number of tests taken in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the calendar week of 12/2020, at the SARS-CoV-2 trial alone, a total of at least 483,295 analyses, up to and including week of 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. Researchers at Israeli Technion clinics and Rambam Hospital developed and tested the test method simultaneously.
The construction of this laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Wang Jiang and completed in just 5 days; the simulations showed that if this laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, the incidence of the disease in Hubei would have been 47% higher, and, accordingly, the cost of quarantine would also be twice as high.
After the opening of the laboratory in Wuhan, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately opened in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai - a total of 12 cities in China.
By March 4, 2020, the daily total throughput was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex circuits of Origami Assays were released, which can test up to 1,122 analyses of COVID19 patients using only 93 vials. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, excluding the need to use robotic liquid manipulators.
By March, due to shortages and insufficient reagents, mass testing in the EU, the UK and the US had become problematic.
As a result, some authors resorted to test sample processing protocols that provide for heating samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release RNA genome for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the volume of coronavirus testing that is being conducted by the United Arab Emirates per capita will exceed the rates of any other country, and soon most of the population will be tested.
This was due to the possibility of express testing, along with the acquisition from Group 42 and BGI of a mass testing laboratory of the population (created on the basis of their laboratories for the detection of emergency cases of Huo-Yang in China).
The lab, deployed in 14 days, is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world’s first laboratory of such a large scale operating outside of China.
Various testing options targeting different parts of the coronavirus’ genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German version of the test kits, which are shipped to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German version was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Sanitary and Epidemiological Centers was not available until January 28, which led to the lack of test kits in the United States. At the very beginning of the outbreak, there were problems with the reliability of test kits in China and the United States, and these countries, as well as Australia, were not able to provide a sufficient number of kits in the areas recommended by experts.
But in South Korea, according to experts, the wide availability of testing helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
For several years, the South Korean government has been working to provide testing capabilities, mostly in private laboratories.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased development of testing programs as the best way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the growing demand for testing caused by the rapid spread of the virus, many private US laboratories, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of tests, were overloaded, and stockpiles of materials for swab collection and chemical reagents quickly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
American test kits developed by the CDC had “flaws” and for this reason the government eliminated bureaucratic barriers that hindered private test development. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of using these kits were inaccurate.
The company explained that the inaccuracy of the results may be due to unsuccessful sampling or improper use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would recall kits that yield inaccurate results and replace them with other kits from Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased in China gave incorrect results. 1.2 million test kits purchased by Slovakia in China were also found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic proposed to dump them in the Danube. Atesh Kara, an employee of the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test kits purchased in China had a "high level of errors" and the Ministry "did not start using them". The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these kits were unsuitable for use.
Quarantine measures for individuals whose tests tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, as well as monitoring of people with whom such patients were in contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where a person died of COVID-19 for the first time in Italy, conducted two cycles of testing the entire population of about 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed cases were quarantined.
Entry to the territory of the settlement was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
In the context of intensive monitoring of contacts, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore was much less tense than in other developed countries, and there did not have to impose such extreme restrictions as forced closures of restaurants and shops.
Many activities there were canceled, and on 28 March Singapore began to urge residents to stay home, but schools that ended on 23 March opened on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also dealt with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, entry restrictions, testing and quarantine measures, but the restrictions were less aggressive.
A statistical study found that in countries where more tests were performed compared to the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because these countries were able to identify more patients with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 test results to one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Seven of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
In the next graph, the indicators of the “% of positive results” column depend on the testing policy adopted in a particular country.
A country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive percentage than a country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of symptoms of the virus, under other equal conditions.
Hand washing, also known as “hand hygiene,” is the process of cleaning hands to remove contaminants, fat, microorganisms, or other harmful substances.
Regular hand washing with soap at certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
A person may also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., mucous membranes) with unwashed hands.
Five critical moments during the day, after which you should wash your hands with soap: before and after defecation, after washing the child's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating, and also before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with ash. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after the procedures for the care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or washing a child who went to the toilet.
After snoring, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the hygienic actions associated with medical procedures.
Washing your hands before taking medication or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause diseases), as well as of chemicals that can be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is especially important for people who are engaged in cooking or working in the medical field, but it is also important for everyone else.
Washing hands is very good for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious types of diarrhea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
It also reduces the infant mortality rate at home.
A 2013 study found that better hand washing can lead to a slight acceleration in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Regular reminders of the benefits of hand washing can reduce diarrhea cases by about a third, and this is comparable to the benefits of providing low-income regions with clean water.
Reducing diarrhea cases by 48% may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory diseases (ASD) provided that appropriate habits are developed in every home, school and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main complications of ORI, is the leading cause of death among children under the age of five, which kills approximately 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia in general kill almost 3.5 million children annually.
The United Nations Children’s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before meals and after toilets, which has become a solid habit, can save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrheal deaths by almost half, and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Washing hands also prevents the occurrence of impetigo, a disease that is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small negative consequence of frequent hand washing is that it can lead to drying of the skin, and, consequently, to its damage.
A 2012 Danish study found that washing your hands too often can lead to itching and peeling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis of the hands, which is especially common among health professionals.
Too frequent hand washing can also be considered one of the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called "critical moments" during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of fecal-oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (urination, defecation), after washing the baby's buttocks (changing diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or processing raw meat, fish or raw meat.
Some other cases where you should wash your hands to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after treatment of the cut or wound, after sneezing, coughing or snorting, after touching animal waste or animals, after touching debris.
In many countries, the procedure of washing hands with soap is quite common.
A study on handwashing procedures, which was conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, found that the average for 38.7% of families, handwashing with soap is a common practice. A 2014 study found that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States in this list is closer to the middle, their index is 77%; the lowest rate was in China
The “Emergency Health Programme”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen children’s health and improve the level of education of children.
The basis of this national program is deworming, which is carried out twice a year, as well as daily hand washing with soap and daily brushing with fluoride.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is more effective if soap or detergents are added in the washing process.
The main effect of soaps and detergents is to remove barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective skin cleanser, as the fats and proteins that are components of organic pollution are poorly soluble in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the purification process.
Solid soap, due to repeated use, can also contain bacteria that can get on it when used previously.
A small amount of research devoted to getting on the skin of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid soap suggests that it is unlikely to get in as the bacteria are washed away with foam.
The CDC still claims that “liquid soap with a manual dispenser is the preferred option for hand washing.”
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that care about their health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants has a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soap contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selective against antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not match the advertised one.
In addition to the surface-active substance and skin protection products, complex compounds can contain acids (acetic, ascorbic, and lactic acid) as a pH regulator, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other fragrances (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). Comprehensive analysis conducted by the School of Public Health of the University of Oran
The hot water comfortable to human skin temperature is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria reproduce much faster at a body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm soapy water is more effective than cold.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water does not affect the reduction of microbial load on the hands.
Hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a hand sanitizer that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based hand hygiene products that did not contain water (also known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most of these products are made on the basis of isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with the addition of thickeners, such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of a gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerin in liquid or foam form, providing convenience of use of these products and reducing the effect of drying the skin with alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis wand, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 3.5 is similar to a reduction of 35 decibels) on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% – 99.999% of bacteria (logarithm of reduction 4-5) on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It is necessary to use a sufficient amount of antiseptic or alcohol-containing agent to carefully treat and impregnate the skin of the hands on both sides.
The front and back surface of both palms, as well as the space between the fingers along the entire length, are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is fully absorbed.
The fingertips on both hands should also be washed thoroughly. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends choosing to wash your hands rather than using disinfectants, especially if your hands are heavily contaminated.
The growing popularity of such disinfectants is due to their ease of use and rapid destruction of microorganisms, but they should not be a substitute for full hand washing, if there is an opportunity to use water and soap.
Frequent use of hand sanitizers on an alcohol basis can cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softeners and (or) skin moisturizers.
The effect of drying the skin with alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other mitigating substances to the composition of the product.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing softening components caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants practically do not occur.
The lower likelihood of irritating contact dermatitis has become a factor in favor of the choice of disinfectants compared to soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, products that do not contain water do not cleanse hands of organic substances, but simply disinfect them.
It is for this reason that hand sanitizers are not as effective in preventing the spread of many pathogenic microorganisms as ordinary soap and water, because when using such agents, pathogenic microorganisms still remain on their hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizer is largely dependent on the components and composition, and has historically been significantly lower than that of alcohol or alcohol-containing products.
More recently, drugs that use benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity as opposed to alcohol, which has been shown to lose effectiveness after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and replace it with ash or clay.
Ash or clay may be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it can, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
If soap is not available, WHO recommends using ash or sand as an alternative.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends hand washing techniques that include the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water, because standing water can be contaminated, but the temperature of the water just does not matter.
Wash your hands by rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the back of your palms, as well as areas between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and research shows that when using soap (rather than just one water), people tend to wash their hands more thoroughly.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Friction helps remove germs from the skin, and the longer you hold your third hand, the more germs are removed.
Carefully rinse your hands under running water.
Rinsing your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wipe your hands with a clean towel or let them dry on their own.
Wet and wet hands are easier to contaminate. Most often, people neglect areas such as the thumb, wrist, areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cracked nail polish can contain many microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing lotion to prevent the skin of the hands from drying out, which can cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different inexpensive ways to wash your hands: pouring water from a hanging canister or bottled pumpkin with holes made and/or using ash, if necessary, as is the case in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas with watersheds in developing countries) there are solutions
A foot pedal crane is a simple structure consisting of a container suspended on a rope and a foot lever that should be pressed to pour water on the hands; a piece of soap should be used.
Effective hand drying is an integral part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The growing volume of research shows that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers that are installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Wipes and Towels; the subject of this study was a comparison of the level of hygiene of paper towels, hand dryers with warm air and more modern flow air dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a dryer with warm air, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by an average of 194%, and on the palms - by 254%.
It was also found that after washing and drying the hands in the air-flow dryer, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads increases by 42%, and on the palms - by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria on the finger pads decreases on average to 76%, and on the palms - up to 77%. Scientists also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-infection of several visitors to the toilet rooms and the toilet environment for each type of drying.
The jet-air dryer, which releases air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is able to blow microorganisms out of its hands and from its own unit and potentially infect other users of the toilet room and bathroom in a radius of up to 2 meters.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads microorganisms in a radius of up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
There was no significant spread of microorganisms when using paper towels. In 2005, TÜV Produkt und Umwelt conducted a study to evaluate various methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed, depending on the method of hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to drying with paper towels.
Hand cleaning using disinfectant wipes can be an alternative solution during travel in the absence of soap and water.
Hand sanitizer on an alcohol basis should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its high effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in hospital conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff to wash their hands if they forget.
According to one study, the use of such devices, in fact, helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical hand washing lasts at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and wipe each part of the hands.
The hands should be carefully rubbed against each other, crossing the fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, you can use a brush to remove it.
Since germs can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to rinse them well and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying hands, closing the tap, and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, you should use a paper towel.
This prevents re-contamination of the hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in medical institutions is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("microbes") and prevent their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before touching patients, and thus spread microorganisms.
According to one study, proper hand washing and other basic procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet depicting a standard hand washing and hand treatment procedure that should be used in the health sector.
The draft WHO manual on hand hygiene is also available on its website and is open to public discussion.
A corresponding review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If it is necessary to confirm compliance with regulatory requirements, commercial devices can be used to measure indicators and check hand hygiene.
The World Health Organization defines “five moments” when you need to wash your hands:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
before the use of antiseptics, as well as
after patient care procedures. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap when washing hands ("medical" or "antimicrobial" soap) helps to destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary before surgery or in an environment with a high content of organisms resistant to antibiotics. To "clean" the hands before surgery requires a tap that can be turned on and off without touching it with your hands; you should also use a little chlorhexidine or iodine water to rinse your hands, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually within 2-6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands too long, for example, for 10 minutes.
During rinsing, water from the forearm should not fall back on the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical gown.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after procedures for caring for a sick person.
To combat staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the first 20% of hand washing benefits the most, and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the frequency of hand washing was increased by more than 35%.
Compared with antibacterial soap washing, hand washing with ordinary soap leads to a more than threefold increase in the frequency of antibacterial infectious diseases transmitted through food. A comparison of hand washing with alcohol-containing solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap, on average 30 seconds for each procedure, showed that the treatment of hands with alcohol-containing soap 2
However, soap and water are still more effective than alcohol solutions for hands, in terms of reducing the amount of influenza A H1N1 virus on the hands and Clostridium difficile spores. Hand hygiene development activities in medical institutions may include training staff by washing hands, increasing the availability of alcohol-containing solutions for hands, as well as written and oral staff.
More research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective and important means for improving health and even digestion.
However, the lack of a stable water supply, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to inculcate the habit of washing hands regularly.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has hand-washing faucets, although there are cheap ways to organize hand-washing in such places.
However, insufficient hand hygiene can also be caused by ingrained habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and encouraging hand washing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing, and lead to long-term changes in public behavior.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, monitoring and evaluation of results are required.
In the course of the systematic analysis of 70 studies, it was found that to improve the situation with hand hygiene in countries with incomes below the average level, we are also effective in sanitary and epidemic supervision at the community level, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of propaganda regarding hand washing in schools is the approach of the United Nations Children's Fund "Three Star Approach": it promotes the practice of
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can raise their level from one to three stars.
The installation of hand washing machines is one of the possible measures implemented within the framework of information campaigns on hand hygiene in order to reduce the incidence and child mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behavior. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, the United Nations Children’s Fund promotes the use of emoji symbolizing hand washing.
Some studies looked at the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared to DALYs (preserved years of life without disability).
However, one study suggests that stimulating hand washing with soap is a much more economical solution compared to other sanitation measures.
The importance of hand washing for human health – especially for vulnerable categories of people such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals – was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two innovators in the field of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale.
At the time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by rotting odors called miasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spreading through the digestive tract and infections related to medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States became more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become more aware of the importance of washing their hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
In Germany, for example, posters with “right hand washing techniques” were hung next to hand-washers in public toilets, as well as in toilets of office buildings and airports.
The phrase “washing hands” means showing your unwillingness to accept responsibility for anything or to be a participant in anything.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate "washed his hands" when deciding on the crucifixion of Jesus Christ; later this phrase became more widely used in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to involuntarily wash her hands in an attempt to clear herself of an imaginary stain that symbolizes an impure conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and prompted her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who remembered or observed any unethical act tend to wash their hands more often than other people, and for them hand washes are more important.
Also, people who were able to wash their hands after what they saw are less likely to participate in any other “cleansing” compensatory activities, such as volunteering.
In religions, hand washing has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. Symbolic hand washing with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual provided in many religions, including Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'<0xC3><0xAD>s, Hindus, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also predicate hand washing.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after a toilet visit.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash your hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19
The control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 implies the use of methods to ensure occupational safety and health in order to control the risk and fight against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Appropriate control of risks in the workplace depends on the place and task of work, is based on risk assessment, the severity of the community epidemic situation and risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) reported that low-risk positions have minimal professional contact with the public and colleagues, and in such cases require basic infection control measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home for signs of illness, adherence to respiratory etiquette, and conducting daily cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk positions require frequent or close contact with people who do not have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but are likely to become infected due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
This category may include workers in contact with the public, for example, in schools, high-density work environments and in some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-performance air filters, the use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical and morgue personnel who have been in contact with a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection are at high risk; the risk increases to very high when such personnel carry out procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, or collect/process samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19.
Risk control measures suitable for such employees include the use of engineering and technical safety measures, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the respective task.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have different types of workplace impacts.
Workers may be absent from the workplace due to their own illness, the need to care for others or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may vary with respect to both the types of goods in demand and the ways in which such goods are purchased (e.g., making purchases in non-peak periods with delivery or service without leaving the machine).
Finally, there may be interruptions in the delivery of goods from the geographical regions affected by COVID-19. When organizing protection, the Epidemic Preparedness and Response Plan can be used.
The plans address the risks associated with different jobs and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors arising at home and in communities, and risk factors for individual workers, such as older age or the presence of chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of control necessary to deal with such risks, as well as contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the epidemic.
Epidemic preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or state-level recommendations.
Some of the objectives of the epidemic response include reducing the spread of the virus among staff, protecting people at higher risk of serious health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative impact on other organizations in their supply chains.
Response measures are affected by the degree of seriousness of the disease in the community where the business is located.
The hierarchy of risk control tools is a structure widely used in occupational safety and health to group such tools according to efficiency.
If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective are engineering and technical safety measures, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protection measures.
Engineering safety measures involve isolating employees from workplace risks and not relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures that require action from an employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to address some of the risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the threat to the worker, be appropriate in size (e.g., respirators), be used continuously and properly, be regularly inspected, maintained in good condition and replaced as necessary, and be properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that low-risk jobs have minimal contact with the public and their peers.
Basic anti-epidemic measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, adherence to respiratory etiquette, including hand-closing when coughing and sneezing, provision of daily napkins and garbage containers, readiness for remote or shift work, and recommendations for workers to avoid using other tools and tools, if necessary.
Identifying and isolating individuals who are potentially infected is a critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff members with symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay at home until the fever stops, the lack of high body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipyretic agents or other medications to eliminate symptoms, and prescribes that staff members be given the flexibility to stay at home.
According to OSHA, mid-risk positions require frequent and close contact at a distance of no more than six feet (1.8 m) with people for whom there is no confirmed data or suspicion of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of infection with SARS-CoV-2 due to the spread of the disease in society in the territory where the business is located, or due to the recent travel of such a person to the places of spread of COVID-19.
To such categories of workers who have had contact with the public, for example, in schools, in the working environment with a high population density and in some large retail stores, and to those who do not have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to safety equipment, to those who have access to safety equipment, to safety equipment, to those who have access to those who have access to such equipment, to such large and to safety equipment, to safety equipment, to such large and to such equipment, to such equipment, to such as to those who have access to those who have access to those who have access to safety equipment, to such equipment, to such as to such as to such equipment, to such as to such equipment, to such as to such equipment, to such equipment and to those who have access to such equipment, to such equipment and to such equipment, to such groups and to such groups, to such groups and to such groups and to such groups, to such groups and to such groups and to such groups and to such groups, to those who are to such groups and to such groups, to such groups, to such groups, to such groups, to such groups, to such groups, to such groups, to such groups and to those who are at higher risk.
In rare cases, workers in this risk group may need to wear respirators.
If a person is sick on an airplane, measures such as isolating a sick person from other people at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to care for a sick person, giving a mask to the sick person or asking such a person to cover his nose and mouth with a napkin when coughing or sneezing are required to ensure proper safety of workers and other passengers.
Secondary crew members should wear disposable medical gloves when approaching a sick traveler or in contact with physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has fever, regular coughing or difficulty breathing.
Used gloves and other disposable items should be placed in a biologically safe bag, and contaminated surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, security measures include postponement of travel in case of illness, self-isolation and immediate information to the medical center.
Ideally, a medical examination should take place in an isolated cabin of such a person. In the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends short-term closure for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person was in the school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of spread of infection in the community, social distancing strategies can be implemented, for example, the cancellation of trips for personal meetings, meetings and other mass events, such as physical education or choral singing, eating in cafeterias, increasing the distance between the reception desks, adjusting the time of arrival and care, limiting non-essential places for children to visit, the use of symptoms.
At a significant rate of spread in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, measures for long-term school leave may be considered. For law enforcement officers performing daily duties, the immediate health risk is considered low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same guidelines as prescribed to ambulance paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their moulded belts and equipment before re-use with household cleaning aerosols or by wiping, follow standard operating procedures to prevent the spread of the disease and dispose of used personal protective equipment, as well as the use and washing of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health care workers and morgue workers are at high or very high risk.
High-risk positions include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport personnel who are in contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection when they perform procedures accompanied by aerosol formation, or when collecting/processing samples from people with a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanied by aerosol formation include sensing, procedures that cause coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures, and examinations or sampling by invasive methods.
High-risk morgue workers include staff involved in treating the bodies of people with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff conduct an autopsy, they fall into a category with a very high risk. Additional engineering and safety measures for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with a confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19.
In some health facilities and morgues, the use of special ventilation with negative pressure can be an effective measure.
Samples should be treated with the precautions required for biosafety level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be allocated to delimited waiting areas depending on whether there is a suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Among other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of respirators for workers interacting at a distance of up to 6 feet with patients with a confirmed disease or suspected infection of SARS-CoV-2, as well as for persons accompanying the procedures.
In the U.S., NIOSH-approved N95-filtered respirators or higher class respirators should be used as part of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that specifies requirements for individual selection and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the employee. WHO does not recommend the use of workwear, as COVID-19 is a disease transmitted respiratoryly, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for staff performing screening at the patient reception point.
Those who collect airway samples from patients with COVID-19 or carriers of the disease without procedures accompanied by the formation of aerosols, WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, goggles or face shield, bathrobe and gloves.
When performing procedures accompanied by the formation of an aerosol, instead of a surgical mask, a respirator N95 or FFP2 should be worn.
Given the insufficient availability of personal protective equipment around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for such protective equipment through the use of remote medicine, physical barriers, such transparent windows, ensuring access to the patient infected with COVID-19, only those persons who provide direct care, the use of only those personal protective equipment that are necessary for a particular task, the continued use of the same protective equipment with the same protective equipment.

Authorizations: CC0: No protected rights
We are living in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the interconnectedness of people around the world and our responsibility to each other.
We have not had precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity of compassion, cooperation and community development around the world, which underlies such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships between all our colleagues, which is reflected in emails, calls and chats – a wonderful confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we have amazing people working with us.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week I was told about the high appreciation of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to be able to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for everyone to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible thanks to your work, whether it is to ensure the functionality of the sites, pay our colleagues or protect the security of the communities.
The world needs the information presented on Wikipedia, and it is even more important today than ever before.
At such a time, in order to achieve meaningful results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order of our joint work starting next week.
Adjusting the order of our work and schedules
As Robin said earlier, the c-team gathered last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization in such a period.
The vast majority of us wanted to ease the tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to retreat, let it be so.
For all staff, contractors and freelancers:
According to our expectations, you will need to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before receiving subsequent orders.
We do not announce weekends: if you can work normally for more hours, this is allowed for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now; whatever your needs are, whether it’s caring for your family, buying groceries, or going to the doctor’s office, your well-being is our number one priority.
We don't keep track of your working hours.
If you are sick, you should not work.
This is understandable and indisputable, but we mention it.
You don’t need a sick leave or sick leave: just inform your supervisor and help the team revise the calendar and schedule to ensure coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, let Brian at T&C Ops know so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from the management to your situation.)
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and confirm our intention to comply with our hourly payment obligations to our contractors and employees.
Each person will be paid according to the usual hourly rates applied under normal circumstances.
This, in particular, implies periods of illness when you can not work.
If you want to work, we will support you.
Many people use work as a way to direct their efforts to the world around us.
What we do can bring amazing results, especially in times like these.
Again, it is about self-help.
We ask you to communicate with your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
Such activities should always be supported.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising teams (among others) are performing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess current targets and shift the focus to providing support, which is crucial for our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we just focus on the most significant projects.
Slowing down today does not mean negative consequences in the future.
We don’t plan to work “twice as much to catch up” after the pandemic has ended.
You will not need to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and will work to set new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What happens to the APP (annual plans)?
In order to adapt to the new reality and expectations for the volume of daily working hours, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our Annual Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to offer an extension to our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, allowing employees to prioritize critical work, self-help and caring for loved ones, while ensuring that everyone who needs or wants to work will have a reduced schedule for the next few weeks.
This extension of time limits significantly reduces the current planning burden and tensions throughout the organization.
Next week, we will present our proposal to the Council, informing representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership role in this work.
Condition of the office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with the COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to a number of precautions, we have hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used medical-grade antiviral solutions to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor is possible.
The building has its own rules that prescribe caution, using products that ensure the safety of their tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Columbia (DC) is part of the WeWork network, which has shared its COVID-19-related policies with us and all staff in DC.
Last week, our office in the District of Columbia completely switched to remote work in accordance with instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we also discussed the issue of renting a room in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing, but they can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues working remotely are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours.
If you need longer sessions, consider breaking them down into a course of several days.
Determine clearly the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and send out materials in advance for review.
By default, use video communication, to facilitate interaction and communication, use tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator - a person who will monitor the arrival of questions in the chat and monitor the list of speakers, as well as responsible for keeping notes (or joint briefing).
If you need to use a convenient headset, please contact the technical support by email.
Take advantage of the Wellness Reimbursement program when buying snacks.
Connect to the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to colleagues about distributed work.
The HR Operations team studies ergonomics manuals available in webinar format to promote distributed work efficiency across the organization.
Last week, we asked all recipients of community grants to cancel mass Wikimedia-funded events such as “editathons” until WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may result in the impossibility of an agreed grant event and no one will be fined for forced delays or changes to such objectives.
Next week, we will hold follow-up events with additional guidance on Wikimania, as well as other regional and community thematic conferences.
The general mood in the global community is not only saddened by the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief from mutual understanding and the ability to focus on one’s own communities, Wikimedia and beyond.
As for the prospects, CRT is working on a page in Meta-Wiki that will provide space for the community to monitor impact and communication.
We remain in touch on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we will take advantage of the opportunity to additionally share up-to-date information, answer your questions and spend time together, connecting with each other.
We are in this situation together and are ready to help as much as we can.
At the same time, you can still receive information from such e-mail correspondence, and other important information on COVID-19 from Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages, and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff residing in countries that have been significantly affected by the current situation.
If you have any questions about travel, activities, key workflow, problems with information coverage or if you need any other help, contact CRT.
We are ready to provide support and provide communication as needed.
If you have privacy issues, please email Bryan Judah, Director of HR International Global Operations.
No such change should be regarded as a renunciation of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the possible current need for a radically new adaptation of our work and commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and enable us to continue working, to provide the necessary support to our movement and the world with the right service.
Our planned work will wait until the appropriate time.
Today is the time to support each other and to create space for important work in the coming weeks and possibly months.
For this to happen, we will need help from each of you; and we need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with maximum impact as soon as such a need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Ryan M).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase domain M2 and the C-terminal transport domain of the renal amino acid collector.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein, its enzymatically active domain reaches the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is split off from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most alveolar lung cells type II, enterocytes of the small intestine, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries of most organs.
Biosynthesis of ACE2 and RNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a counterweight to ACE.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into vascular angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, breaks down the carboxylic end amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-Hle-I).
ACE2 can also break down a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Strictly speaking, binding of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 adhesion protein S1 to the enzymatic domain ACE2 on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosomes located inside the cells.
This input process also requires the S protein to be primed by serine protease carrier TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent. This has led some to think that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard therapy with APF and BRA inhibitors.
According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, “the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to the control group.”
Moreover, “the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients receiving ACE inhibitors who were at higher risk for pneumonia, especially patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in mortality from pneumonia, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be an innovation in therapy for acute lung damage and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours, and the onset of action is 30 minutes, in addition to the duration of exposure in 24 hours.
Some evidence suggests that rhACE2 may be a promising agent for people with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is increased.
COVID-19 apps are mobile phone software applications designed to assist in epidemiological investigations in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, that is, in identifying individuals (“contacts”) who may have been in contact with an infected person.
In some regions, many applications have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options for contact tracking applications have been developed.
This has sparked a debate about privacy issues, especially with regard to those systems that are based on tracking the geographic location of app users.
Softer options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they will combine their efforts to integrate the Bluetooth-based support functionality of such applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government together with Alipay has deployed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have communicated with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses an application called TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT companies, has open source and will be transferred to the government. North Macedonia has launched the “StopKorona!” application, running on Bluetooth, which helps to track contacts with potentially infected people and provides operational communication with health authorities.
The application was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was waiting for registration in the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government announced that the contact tracking application is in the final stage of development and will be available for deployment within a few weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering the possibility of using applications based on the Singaporean application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geozoning function, the purpose of which is to ensure that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security at the University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that can arise with application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies in the case of using the application only a small part of the population.
Given concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious "coronavirus" apps, Apple has restricted the list of types of organizations that can offer their coronavirus-related apps to the App Store, including only "official" or other trusted organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants in the privacy campaign expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance of the population through coronavirus-related applications; in particular, the question was raised whether the surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic would be dismantled when the threat disappeared.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations have announced eight conditions they impose on state projects:
monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
The expansion of monitoring and surveillance should be accompanied by reservations on the limitation of the period of validity;
the use of data should be limited to the purposes of combating the spread of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such security must be provided;
Digital surveillance should eliminate cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties should be defined at the level of law;
Protection against abuses should be guaranteed, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also published their list of terms and conditions.
Google and Apple are proposing a joint plan to address the ongoing surveillance problem, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their devices’ operating systems as soon as the need for it disappears.
In some countries, network location tracking is used instead of apps, which eliminates the need to download the app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking has been approved.
Network solutions that have access to source location data also have big potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-enhancing systems have been developed that use central servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used to track contacts that did not use apps as a basis.
Instead of using a special application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transactions, and then combined them to create notifications in the form of text messages that were sent to potentially infected individuals.
The government not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected individuals, but also made the location information publicly available, which was made possible due to significant changes in information protection legislation that were made after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information can be accessed through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both centralized systems and privacy-enhancing systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been made public.
Keeping contacts confidential is a well-established concept, with a significant amount of research literature dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-enhancing solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user’s approach to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT tracing is a product of coordination efforts that include both centralized and decentralized approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized privacy tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN),
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that identifiable personal data never leaves the device, and all comparisons take place on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a privacy-enhancing platform for the collection and use of location or intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on research presented in the “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” document, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform, developed by Enigma MPC, a company that also developed privacy technology.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials without compromising the confidentiality of this data.
On April 5, 2020, a global coalition of TCNs was established by groups that share the same approach and use similar protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and ensuring global compatibility of tracking and alerting applications, which is a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On April 9, 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had discovered the source code of BlueTrace used in its official app.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the operation of the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative that they claimed would provide privacy, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and cryptography to maintain privacy.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the operation of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three stages:
Deploying tools to allow governments to create official applications to track the movement of coronavirus-infected citizens, but with confidentiality of data
By integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant monitoring, first implementing the system through operating system updates, and then removing it in the same way after the threat disappears.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug re-profiling, re-direction, task alteration, or therapeutic re-direction) is the re-profiling of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition other than the one originally envisaged during development.
This is one of the areas of scientific research that is currently being used to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of the COVID-19 vaccine and the transfusion of reconvalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 drug-exposed proteins, each of which has several ligand-binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites serves as a suitable basis for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins for SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, protein S, and ADP-ribophosphatase.
Hussein A.A. and co-authors in their preclinical study studied several candidate compounds that were then optimized and analyzed their similarity in structure to the most similarly approved drugs to accelerate the development of a highly effective drug against SARS-CoV-2 that would be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used in the treatment of some autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and associated hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs being studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin in the state of New York on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
The treatment regimen has not been approved during the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency care in patients who are hospitalized but unable to receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.
The CDC said that “the order of use, dosage or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the drug when “there is no other way out.”
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is conducted at Duke University and Oxford University.
The New York University School of Medicine in Langona studies the safety and effectiveness of preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipivirine is “unambiguously effective.”
In 35 patients in Shenzhen who took this drug, a negative result was obtained after an average of 4 days, while in 45 patients who did not take the drug, the duration of the disease was 11 days.
A study was conducted in Wuhan in which 240 patients with pneumonia were observed, one half of whom received favipivir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian pharmaceutical agency reminded the public that the results indicating the effectiveness of the drug are scanty and should not be considered final.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would purchase the drug in Japan and use military resources to deliver it to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe told the Trump administration about the possibility of purchasing the drug. The drug may be less effective in advanced cases of the disease.
Its use may not be safe for pregnant patients or for patients who are trying to become pregnant.
According to the results of one study on the combination of antiviral drugs "lopinavir" and "ritonavir" (Caletra), it was concluded that "the effectiveness of the use of drugs has not been revealed."
The drugs were developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that will bind to SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, they criticize the reprofiling of drugs that were specifically developed for the treatment of HIV and AIDS.
The WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Subsequently, Gilead Sciences employees found that remdesivir has antiviral activity in vitro against a variety of filo-, pneumo-, paramyxo- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are currently underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University clinics; one on patients with moderate disease and the other on patients with more severe disease.
Currently, there are three clinical trials for intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of a placebo (Italy).
On March 24, 2020, trials of the antibiotic azithromycin began in New York State.
Japan’s National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical trial of Alvesco (Cyclesonide) Teijin, an inhaled corticosteroid for the treatment of asthma, for its use in the treatment of presymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
The Phase II test, a form of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, is conducted with 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe forms of the disease to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
For the study, called COLCORONA, 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization were invited.
Pregnant, breast-feeding and non-contraceptive women cannot participate in this study.
In Italy, several coagulants are being tested.
Low-molecular heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to publish recommendations for the use of this drug.
On April 14, Italy announced a multicenter study involving 300 patients to study the use of enoxaparin sodium in prophylactic and therapeutic doses.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been focused on re-profiling approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics that have been found to be potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatments:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Also tests in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical 2019 coronavirus vaccine (COVID-19).
Despite the fact that no vaccine has passed clinical trials, numerous attempts to develop such a vaccine continue to be made.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine to be available in less than 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates underwent Phase I safety studies.
The COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, a major outbreak of the disease spread around the world, leading to significant investments in vaccine development and related research.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of CEPI’s vaccine development initiative are to ensure the required speed, production capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that at the beginning of 2020, 10 different technological platforms were in the research and development phase to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Some of the main objectives of the platform included in the Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (developer of stage I and candidate drug for the vaccine: Moderna, iRNA-1273)
viral vector (developer of stage I and candidate drug for the vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus vector type 5)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, another 37 candidate vaccines have been reported, but there is little publicly available information on them (presumably in the planning or development phase).
Preliminary testing for safety and immunogenicity, usually randomized, placebo-controlled and at multiple sites, is carried out in stages I-II, with the simultaneous determination of more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group; at this stage, drugs are tested for effectiveness in preventing the disease and side effects are monitored at optimal dosages.
Of the 79 vaccine candidates in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet undergone human trials (still in preclinical trials).
On January 24, 2020, Queensland University, Australia, announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular-clamped vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, the International Vaccine Center (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the start of work on its own vaccine with the aim of starting human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also announced at the China Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on January 26, 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on January 28.
On January 29, 2020, Janssen pharmaceutical companies, led by Hanneke Schuitmacher, announced the start of work on the development of their vaccine.
Janssen is working with its biotechnology partner Vaxart to develop an oral vaccine.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine using a technology similar to that used for vaccination against neoantigen cancer.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced the completion of work on the synthesis of the vaccine and the beginning of trials.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a project to develop the Ii-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
Their goal was to develop a candidate drug for a vaccine that could be tested in humans in 90 days.
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in St. Louis announced its vaccine development projects.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Material Services Command, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute, Silver Spring, located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into a partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of vaccines.
The partners also announced plans to conduct preclinical trials and a Phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated mode, the development of the vaccine would take at least one and a half to two years.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company, Quebec, reported that with partial funding from the Canadian Institute of Health Research, they had created a coronavirus-like particle.
The potential vaccine is undergoing laboratory testing, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump offered CureVac “large sums of money” for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the German government protested.
On March 17, 2020, U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with German company BioNTech to jointly develop an iRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an iRNA-based vaccine; the drug is currently undergoing preclinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On March 17, 2020, Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that it will receive the results of preclinical trials in April 2020, and their final candidate drug for the vaccine could begin testing in humans as early as autumn.
On March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a consortium to develop a COVID-19 vaccine with the participation of the Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh. CEPI’s total investment in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine is $29 million.
CEPI’s other investment partners in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the universities of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing six different candidates for vaccines on animals.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The candidate drug for the vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the sequence from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous candidate vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago initiatives and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans to create a national “vaccine bank”, which will include several new vaccines that could be used in the event of a new coronavirus outbreak.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, on mice, stating that “MNA administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 subunit vaccines, causing strong antigen-specific antibody responses [in mice] that occurred 2 weeks after immunization.”
On April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo’s Canadian School of Pharmacy announced the development of a potential DNA-based vaccine that may be available in the form of a nasal spray.
With the help of bacteriophages, DNA will multiply inside human bacteria and form harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities combined the resources of IBM’s supercomputers in combination with the cloud computing resources of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other benefits in addition to the disease prevention properties.
Another randomized study, conducted in Australia, involved 4,170 health workers.
The vaccines being developed may be unsafe or ineffective.
Early studies to evaluate the effectiveness of vaccines using animal models characterised by COVID-19, such as ACE2-transgenic mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures for the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardized safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicines or protective vaccines that are safe and effective for humans to treat SARS.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of atypical pneumonia has been a priority for governments and public health institutions around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS began to spread, it was believed that the study of SARS, which was conducted at that time, could become the standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutics against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine that passed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three more vaccines, all of which were viral vector-based vaccines and were under development, two of which were adenovirus (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of which was MVA-Vector (MVA-Vector) vaccines.
A conspiracy theory circulated on social media, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not new at all, and that a vaccine against it already exists.
Social media posts cited the words of some patients who claimed patents on the genetic sequences of other strains of the coronavirus, such as the SARS coronavirus, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include fever, coughing and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include feeling tired, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from the first manifestation of symptoms to the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but can also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases are reduced to the manifestation of mild symptoms, but in some cases the disease flows into viral pneumonia and organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, there were more than 2.24 million cases of infection in 210 countries and regions, more than 153,000 people died from the disease.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus mainly spreads when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic droplets released into the air when coughing, sneezing or talking.
Although these drops are formed by exhalation, they usually pose a threat by hitting the ground or on the surface, but are not transmitted through the air over long distances.
People also become infected by touching the contaminated surface and then their eyes, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, the virus can live for 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a real-time polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription (RT-PCR) on a sample taken as a nasopharyngeal smear.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with a suspicion of the disease, as well as for those who care for them.
Recommendations for the use of medical masks by the population vary: some agencies recommend not to use them at all, some recommend their use, and others require it.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
The local spread of the disease has been reported in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected individuals may not have symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, constant pain or a feeling of tightness in the chest, confusion, difficulty waking up, blueness of the face or lips; if the above symptoms are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory tract disease, such as sneezing, runny nose, or sore throat, may be observed.
Also, in different percentage ratios, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are observed.
Some cases of the disease recorded in China were initially manifested only by a feeling of compression in the chest and a rapid heartbeat.
In some cases, the disease can progress, developing into pneumonia, organ failure, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to manifest within 11.5 days after infection. According to available data, symptoms do not manifest in all infected people.
The role of such asymptomatic carriers in the transmission of the disease is still completely unknown, but preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of infection.
The percentage of infected people with asymptomatic disease is currently unknown, it is only being studied; with the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that in 20% of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations for the virus, the course of the disease was asymptomatic.
China’s National Health Commission has started including asymptomatic cases in its daily report since April 1; out of 166 cases registered on that day, 130 (78%) refused asymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both sputum and saliva can have a high concentration of the virus.
In loud speech, more drops are released into the air than in speech of normal volume.
A study conducted in Singapore found that with an open cough, drops can spread at a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission of virus particles by bioaerosol is still possible, and testing of air processed by air collectors located in corridors outside people's rooms has shown the presence of viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can lead to spraying of exhalation products and, therefore, to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through feces, however, this risk is considered low. The virus is most contagious when people show symptoms; the spread of the virus is possible before symptoms appear, but this risk is small.
The staff of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) argue that it is not yet clear how easily the virus spreads, however, it is known that one patient usually infects 2-3 other people. The virus is able to survive on the surface from several hours to several days.
In particular, it was found that on a cardboard surface the virus is able to live for one day, on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on stainless steel (AISI 304) - up to three days, and on 99% of copper surfaces - up to 4 hours.
These indicators, however, vary depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents, when used correctly, have a quite useful effect in terms of fighting infection: soap destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and is also able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective against this virus. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient, the highest content of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of testing.
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute coronavirus respiratory syndrome first detected in three people with pneumonia from a group with acute respiratory diseases registered in Wuhan.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in naturally related coronaviruses.
Being outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which opens its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organ most susceptible to COVID-19, as the virus penetrates host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most common in type II alveolar lung cells.
The virus connects to ACE2 and penetrates the host cell with the help of a characteristic surface glycoprotein - "peacock" (peplomer).
12% of infected people admitted to a hospital in Wuhan were diagnosed with acute myocardial damage, which is more common in the severe form of the disease.
The frequency of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to the systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders observed during the progression of the disease, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities because they are involved in the work of this organ.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in patients in ICU with COVID-19, and may indicate unfavorable prognosis. Autopsy of patients who died from COVID-19 showed the presence of diffuse alveolar lesions (DAD) and lymphocyte-containing inflammatory lymphocytes.
Despite the fact that SARS-COV-2 has tropism to ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was found that pathogenic GM-CSF T cells correlate with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreting IL-6 and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates were also detected during autopsy.
The WHO has also published several testing protocols for the disease.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard test method.
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal smear, but a nasal or sputum smear sample can also be used.
Results are usually ready within a period of several hours to two days.
You can also take blood tests, but they require two blood samples taken at intervals of two weeks, and their results are not directly relevant.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the coronavirus strain and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the presence of this virus.
As of April 4, 2020, tests for antibodies that could detect the presence of infection at the present time, as well as the fact of a possible infection in the past, were under development, but have not yet become widespread.
Chinese experience of studying the results of these tests showed that their accuracy is only 60-70%.
On March 21, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first on-site diagnostic test, authorizing its use at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines issued by Zhongnan Wuhan University Hospital specify methods for detecting infection based on clinical features and epidemiological risk.
Double-sided multi-sided subpleural sealing foci of the "matte glass" type with peripheral, asymmetrical and aposterior distribution are common symptoms detected at an early stage of the disease.
Subpleural dominance, a symptom of the cobblestone bridge (longitudinal thickening of the septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation develop as the disease progresses.
There is little data on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main results of the pathological study performed at the autopsy:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, sealing and swelling of the lungs
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild form of pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multinuclear giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exsudat.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Healing pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (DVS-syndrome); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the likelihood of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, observing respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a napkin when coughing or sneezing, or, in the absence of a napkin, covering the mouth and nose with the inner side of the elbow area of the hand.
After coughing or sneezing, it is recommended to carry out a quality hygiene procedure for the hands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue face masks in public places, in particular, to limit the transmission of infection by people with asymptomatic disease. Social distancing strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; as part of these measures, schools and enterprises were closed, the movement of citizens was limited and large public institutions were abolished.
Distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There are no drugs with proven effectiveness against COVID-19. Since the completion of vaccine development is expected no earlier than 2021, the bulk of the measures against the spread of COVID-19 is reduced to a reduction in the peak of the epidemic known as "plateau exit".
The CDC also recommends washing hands with soap and water more often for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or with severe hand contamination, as well as before eating and after snorting, coughing or sneezing.
The CDC also recommends the use of a disinfectant alcohol-containing (alcohol content at least 60%) hand treatment, but only when soap and water are not available. In regions where such disinfectants are not sold, WHO provides two locally produced formulations.
These formulations use ethanol or isopropanol, having antimicrobial activity.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol and is not a suitable means for antiseptic hand treatment.
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are shown supportive therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, as well as support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that those who suspect they are infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, it is recommended to observe the rules of personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet.
Supportive therapies can be shown to patients with mild symptoms in the early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, intensive care physicians and pulmonologists have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in a free resource — IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
To treat symptoms as first-line drugs, some health care professionals recommend making a choice in favor of paracetamol (acetaminophen) compared to ibuprofen.
When performing procedures in which airborne discharge may occur, such as intubation or hand drying, precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
Medical workers caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing them in an airborne insulator (AIIR) — an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC has published recommendations on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended personal protective equipment: protective robe, respirator or medical mask, eye protection products and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use respirators rather than medical masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but when used outside the instructions, the effectiveness of protection against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed.
If medical masks are not available, the CDC recommends that you use protective face shields or, as a last resort, make the masks yourself at home.
In most cases, the forms of the COVID-19 course are not severe enough to require artificial ventilation or alternatives, but there is a certain percentage of cases where it turns out to be necessary.
A type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is currently being actively studied, with some evidence in favor of avoiding intubation using a nasal oxygen cannula with intense airflow or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two methods for critically ill patients are as effective as IVF.
Some doctors make the choice in favor of invasive mechanical ventilation of the lungs, if available, as this method significantly limits the propagation of particles in the air compared to the nasal cannula with intense airflow. The risk of severe disease for the elderly (those who are over 60 years old, and especially those who are over 80 years old) is much higher.
Many developed countries lack hospital beds per capita, and the resources of health systems are too limited to cope with the sharp increase in COVID-19 cases in severe forms requiring hospitalization.
According to one study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical lung ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in resuscitation.
The task of providing artificial lung ventilation is complicated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) developing in COVID-19 and oxygenation are causing more and more problems.
Inhaled pressure IVL and PDKV are necessary to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen to the lungs and to ensure that they are minimally damaged by ventilation, as a result of which pneumothorax may develop.
On earlier fan models, high PDKV may not be available.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are currently in clinical trials.
The most promising is remdesivir.
The development of new drugs may last until 2021, but some of the drugs being tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of testing.
Antiviral drugs can be tested on patients with severe forms of the disease.
WHO-recommended volunteers take part in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation to use reconvalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where human life is in serious or imminent danger.
Its use has not been subjected to clinical studies, which should be conducted to prove the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application designed to combat the outbreak of the disease.
To log in, users must enter their name and identification number.
The app can detect “close contact” using surveillance data and, therefore, determine the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-isolation, but also sends a notification to local health authorities. Big data analytics collected from mobile phones, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking, and artificial intelligence – such tools are used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government granted security authorities permission to track the cell phone data of people who were allegedly infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus, Deutsche Telekom provided the federal state institutions of Germany and the Robert Koch Institute with aggregate data on the location of cellular subscribers.
In Russia, facial recognition technology has been introduced to identify quarantine violators.
Giulio Gallera, Italy’s regional health commissioner, said cellular operators reported that “40% of people still continue to move around the territory.”
The German government held a 48-hour weekend programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid also called for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects, or fear of the infection itself.
Rory O’Connor: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, stress, and economic downturn are ideal conditions for harming people’s mental health and well-being.”
The disease can be mild with minor or absent symptoms reminiscent of other common upper respiratory diseases, such as the common cold.
Patients with mild form of the disease usually recover within two weeks, while it may take three to six weeks to treat patients with severe or critical forms.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 based on data on other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, although similar data on COVID-19 are not available. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia as a complication.
In those with the most severe course of the disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or organ failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, abnormal thrombosis, as well as problems with the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Anomalies of thrombosis, especially an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while renal impairment was observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which patients were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to the intensive care unit was seven days.
According to early-stage case studies, the average time from the onset of symptoms to the day of death was 14 days, with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the death rate among men was 2.8% and among women - 1.7%.
Histopathological studies of postmortem lung samples indicate diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
In pneumocytes, viral cytopathic changes were observed.
The appearance of the lung resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were associated with increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89% of hospitalized patients had previous health problems. The availability of medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region can also affect mortality.
Mortality estimates vary by condition due to such regional differences as well as methodological difficulties.
Insufficiently effective light counting can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that deaths occur as a result of diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms overall, and such patients were approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of one of the clinics in Hong Kong found that in some patients who recovered from the disease, the volume of the lungs decreased by 20-30%, and their scans revealed damage.
After recovery, it can also lead to “After Intensive Care” syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether patients who had recovered from the virus developed persistent immunity against it.
Judging by the course of other coronaviruses, this is considered likely, but cases have also been reported where after recovery from COVID-19 coronavirus tests were still positive.
It is believed that in these cases there was an exacerbated prolonged course of the disease, and not re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, calls December 1, 2019 the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is December 8, 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and time of spread of the disease, and are also affected by testing volumes, the quality of health systems, treatment regimens used, the time since the onset of the disease outbreak, and population parameters such as age, gender, and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned to the disease emergency care codes under ICD-10: U07.1 - for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 - for deaths from clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 cases without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
According to statistics from Johns Hopkins University, as of April 17, 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
This figure varies by region. Some other methods include determining the disease-related mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of patients diagnosed who have died as a result of the disease, as well as determining the rate of infection-related mortality (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and undiagnosed) who have died.
These statistics are not time-bound and reflect the indicators of a certain segment of the population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Despite the fact that antibodies are not produced in all patients who have undergone the infection, the presence of such antibodies can tell how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 people (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread during the celebration of the carnival among young people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health care system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population can have antibodies, judging by the indicators of donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004% of the population).
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher in men.
The most at-risk group are men over the age of 50; the gap between men and women is narrowing only from the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this discrepancy are unknown, but may lie in genetic and behavioral factors.
Gender immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women, concomitant diseases in men (for example, hypertension manifested in men at a younger age than in women) can cause higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of COVID-19 deaths were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government does not maintain gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ARVI have different gender statistics.
The majority of health workers, especially nursing staff, are women, respectively, they are more likely to become infected.
On February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
The head of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, explains: “CO” means “crown”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 is the year when the outbreak was first detected: December 31, 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international naming guidelines aimed at preventing stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called Severe Acute Coronavirus Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO further uses the terms “Covid-19 virus” and “the virus responsible for COVID-19”.
Both the disease and the virus itself are usually called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "the coronavirus" and "the Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, in line with the 2015 recommendations on the use of geographical locations in the names of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended the use of the terms “acute respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names for the virus and disease.
On February 11, 2020, the official names “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2” were published.
Due to restrictions on the volume of standard supply chains, some digital service providers print medical materials, such as nasal swabs, as well as parts of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve, and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, then one of the local factories was reprofiled and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various conspiracy theories, disinformation and fake information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects began to spread rapidly on the Internet.
It is likely that humans can infect other animals with the virus.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and chickens.
At the moment, there is no approved vaccine for the virus or drugs for its treatment.
Various international studies of COVID-19 vaccines and drugs are currently being conducted by governmental organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO launched the SOLIDARITY Trial, which aims to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing compounds considered to be the most effective to date.
A ready-made vaccine does not yet exist, but various organizations are actively developing candidate drugs for the vaccine.
Both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 penetrate into human cells with the help of the ACE2 receptor, so scientific developments use the results of previous studies conducted on SARS-CoV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First, the researchers seek to create a whole-virion vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at triggering a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a subunit vaccine, aims to create a vaccine that increases the immune system's sensitivity to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are aimed at destroying the S-hip protein, which helps the virus penetrate the receptor of the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is to develop vaccines based on nucleic acids (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new method for creating a vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine on four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Anti-Telosuppressive enhancement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of vaccines from SARS-COV-2, but this assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
The drugs approved for the treatment of malaria were evaluated in seven trials, four of which were for hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reprofiling of antiviral drugs makes up the majority of Chinese studies; by the end of April, nine Phase III studies on remdesivir had been conducted in several countries.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidate drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 has been conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 are also considered, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon.
As of March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of remdesivir use are available.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesivir as an exception.
Phase III clinical trials are already underway in the US, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was reviewed in China in February 2020, and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for expert evaluation of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that doubling this dose is very dangerous and can lead to death.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued a permit for emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating COVID-19 patients. Chinese 7th edition guidelines also listed interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir as a means against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for detailed in vivo study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations. Studies have shown that the penetration of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor requires priming of the spike protein by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2).
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that prevent the medical community from using these therapies without further study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of the severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have the properties of hypercytokinemia. As a result of a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China, tocilizumab was included in the recommendations for the treatment of coronavirus.
This drug came out on stage 2 of the non-randomized test, which is conducted at the national level in Italy, after positive results were obtained for its use in patients with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with serum analysis for ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, the FDA approved an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by another cause, T-cell CAR therapy.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transmission of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune systems of patients who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is now considered a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested in the treatment of patients with SARS, but its results have been inconclusive.
Virus neutralization is the expected effect by which passive antibody therapy can provide protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may also be used.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are under development.
The use of reconvalescent blood serum, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains antibodies against this virus, may be increased.
