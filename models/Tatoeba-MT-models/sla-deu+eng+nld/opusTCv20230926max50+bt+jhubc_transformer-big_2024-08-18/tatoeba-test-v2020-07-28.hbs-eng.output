I keep saying that.
Tell her I'm innocent.

I'm just very grateful.
You misunderstood everything.
So, what do you think?
Let's wait a minute.
Tom kisses badly.
Good morning, everyone.
What time is it, please?
Let's start counting.

Start counting.

Tom tried to intimidate Mary.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Can I take a look at your map?
Oh, thanks.
Everyone says so.

Even a child knows that.
Who are you describing?
We were the only guests.
Tom's a moler.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Have you decided what you're going to do?
Are you sure this thing is safe?
My family loved the dog.
You're absolutely right.
I exchanged opinions with Tom.
Her name is Lucifer.
They can never do it any other way than by force.
Is it yours?
I thought I'd have another chance at it.
He'll understand.
Tom, we need to take a taxi to the station.
I'm trying to win her heart.
I'm not here for that.
I assumed you were busy.
She's finally asleep.
Tom's laughing at Mary.
It's almost half past three.
Jump.
We know him.
I don't know if that'll be enough money for me.
Can you put on the curtains?
Have you ever tried it?
Don't drink water from a dirty glass!
This seems inhumane to me.
Did you have lunch?
They say love is blind.
Can you tell me how to get to the airport?
What is it, little kitten, would you like some cream?
We didn't have this in mind for you.
I'm happy as a cat in pajamas.
We've never played football before.
How did you like Boston?
Tom seemed nervous.
Tom would still be alive if he had tied his belt.
It looked yellow to me.
I'm celebrating.
I am against compromise.
Eat slowly.
Everything has a price.
Tom picked up Mary.
Keep trying.
She doesn't use salt when cooking.
We got off the train.
We've always been close.
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
Tom comes here three or four times a month.
What's this?
I went to the hospital.
We've never been here.
Sing! Sing!
Because of the blizzard, our train was an hour late.

Just watch out for Tom.
Unbelievable!
I was at school.
I'll figure it out.
I'm in better shape than you are.
He gave up.
Maybe they're somewhere around the lake.
Everyone was looking for Tom.
I wish I knew.
We have a good chance of winning.
Tom's not in shape.
I don't have enough time to explain it to you in detail.
Ivan's a good guy.
I'll talk to Tom about it.
I'm hurt.
Let's talk about your idea.
It's normal.
That's what I was gonna say.
I'll call her tonight.
He went for a walk.
Tom finally realized that Mary was right.
It's been a crazy year.
Get out of here, Tom.
It is impossible to say with certainty.
Tom had never left his home before.
You owe me a lot.
I don't burn Turkish.
It's like summer outside.
It's only been a day.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
They're waiting for us.
What's your story?
Go ahead.
You have no idea how right you are.
I've been looking for you.
It's gonna take forever.
Why would I want to kill you all?
I forgot.
This knife isn't sharp.
Just shut up.
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom spoke French.
Everyone is a boss in their own home.
These are my best friends.
I swim in the ocean.
Have you seen Tom's room?
Let's take some pictures.
I found something, too.
Don't stop.
We've never played football before.
She tried.
What school did you go to?
The clouds are getting darker.
By nature, he's gentle.
I have a serious question.
I predicted this would happen a few months ago.
I looked around.

I hope Tom's safe.

I agreed to buy it.
She's in a bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're joking.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination run wild.
All right, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years have it been since I last saw you?
If you do that, you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
You're an ointment for the soul.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your stupid business.

Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
It's nice weather today.
Can you make Tom laugh?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is located in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends teased her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You have to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom swirled around the room, unable to calm down.
Can I get a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Get some rest, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how that's possible.
Santa lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up! Wake up!
You chose the handsome one.
Look how big it is!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I find it hard to talk about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
It's their book.
Mary came back from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom's gonna get here.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Will you turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic fingertips, creating music that's very enjoyable to listen to.

I'm fat.
In order to be able to read the chorus, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom was slumbering.
They wanted an apology.

Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you a little later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom cooks for us.
We live in a house.
You're not done yet?
You're very uneducated.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of a foreign language is good for everyone.

I'm eating here.
It's all right. It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake? You should go to bed.
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
Insensible children can grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like her to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you get me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
She doesn't know the hatred of others.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in monasteries.
No one believes him anymore.
Keep the kids away from the drugs.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if maybe I was dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game may be delayed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work from the hour and a half.
It's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
It's right here.
I'll invent something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Drinking coffee?
Some of us think that such views are purely insanity.
It's working.
Someone could be hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was here.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to handle this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't drink vodka.
We need to be reasonable.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to renew your passport.
I think Tom pulled a thicker end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I'm more worried about you than I am about Japan's future.
I couldn't help feeling sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I got wet to the skin.
Come and play with us.
And that was only with great difficulty.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's no reason to panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by poorly understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
- What's your name?
They're trying.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Help us find this card.
Can you tell the difference between silver and tin?
Hands up!
I don't exercise as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
That's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I disagree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it is impossible to live.
I played the piano a long time ago, so I can still do a little bit of it.
Is this your glass, or your sisters?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.

We're finally here!
He's in good hands.
He told himself that he had to work in the garden for two hours a day.
Apples and pears are donated, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's speech is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you!
I'm really proud of that.
We were in last place.
I've contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
That doesn't exactly look like you.
She achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
The madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This is not a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
It's time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The meeting statement is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating anyway?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man hopes as long as he lives.
Be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, I'll be fine.
I'm so full of miracles.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate that.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the kind of thing she sent you when you asked her not to give you pictures of Applejack's brother?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a critique of Mack's physical appearance. "Yes." "Then she sent a critique to Mack." "...Yes." "What did you tell her that you learned from that?"
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I overlook that?
I don't want to take any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live a day like a lion than a hundred years like a sheep.
"Did he explain?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is a magic lamp.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to sleep.
Tom's gonna wait.
What's gonna happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
She's ashamed of lying.
I'm not a nocturnal bird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who should do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit a torch before he entered the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth in what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out of here!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have got caught and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm investigating it right now.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What are we really looking for?
She achieved her goal.
You can do whatever you want, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they said to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Oh, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never takes the train.
He's addicted to Starbucks coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides will be giving speeches this week.
I plan to give my son a computer at the end of the month.

Tell me about your teacher.

Birds fly.
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not angry at all.
As far as we know, it's Tom's fault.
I love you.

I've been thinking a lot about what you said.
Did Tom draw a thicker end?
I am not afraid of death, but of dying.
We like him.
That's a good answer.
You sound tired.
Tom wasn't right about that.
I don't need anything.
Tom's always making a mess of things.

I thought you were married.
Somehow I'll find the money.
I assumed you were busy.
He's not a scientist, but he's our friend.

I think Tom's very smart.

Fish, please.
I think I'm fat.
I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Are you learning French at your school?
Come have a drink with me.
If I could understand, I'd say so.
You're running.
I took the first step.
Stop yelling.
It's Saturday.
They were evacuated to an American hospital.
We'll run in the park.
How far is it from here?
You can't sit next to me.
I'm not happy about that.
Could you read it?
Will you dance with me?
We need to call Tom.
Tom's not strong enough.
We need more flour.
Tell me what he says here.

I'm sure there's a better way to do it.
The first leaves at 17:30 and arrives at 20:25.
That was a little weird.
Plants are growing.
Does that read and write Japanese?
Tom put the card on the table.
I called him.
It was all just an accident.
Tom never even saw us.
Mom, I'm hungry.
I don't intend to do that.
Tom says he wasn't here.
That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked my bike.
Now, a word from our sponsor.
I'm not at all happy with the situation.
Do you have a copy?
We can't call him as a witness.
That's not the main question.
We're glad we're here.
Stay calm.
I'm armed.
Tom can't hold back.
Our eyes can't see the infrared rays.
It's time to sleep.
Tom is very intelligent.
Can I replace this?
Tom wanted to have a nicer cat than his neighbor.
I'm impressed with you.
Did you bring a hair dryer?
I already ordered it.
We'll never know the reason.
How do you feel?
Everybody tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.
Anything you can remember can help.
Many predictions do not come true.

I'm still wrong.
Turns out it's true.
I'm bitter.
Did you bring the book back to the library?

He is an activist in his community.
I'm deaf and dumb when I eat.
You look fat.
Learning a language is not easy.
Does your head hurt?
You have to learn English step by step.
It's better now than it was before.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
He asked me who would win the race.
A man has many desires that he does not really want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is also the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become completely sick of eternal life, and would long for it.
Water is liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't believe him.
I'm not a prophet.

Be careful.
Yogurt is made with milk and cream.
I'm alone.
All right, how about you?
Do not drink water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
That was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold is changing every day.
Be nice.
Look around you!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter this room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is painting trains interesting?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a simple man.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What do you plan to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why do you ask?
I saw Marcus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't have followed us.
You, too, Brutus?

Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.

Don't talk.
This information is confidential.

Oh, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not leaving me, are you?
Don't exaggerate.
I can't approve this project.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the front row.
Mary encourages her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to give me my pen back.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to two hundred.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try.
I'll stay home with my grandparents for the weekend.
What did you conclude?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his nerves.
The bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom tricked you.
Tom reads a lot.
He's only a few minutes away.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in a hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're average students.
In childhood, many violent criminals recklessly tortured animals.
I'm going to live in Cambodia.
How long will you be angry and yell at us?
Please, stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom complains all the time.
If you want, I'll teach you to play ukuleles.
I'm used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like what he said to her offended her.
I love playing music written by my friends.

What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked into the party.

I've never seen his face.
Tom's very attentive.
When are you going to leave?
This report isn't very well written.
I want a new bike.
She said the government's latest move has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.
Tom arrived this morning.
It took about a year.
How did I miss that?
Tom didn't answer me.
The five brothers worked together on the farm.
It could be a trick.
The company is known for its high quality products.

Tom knows it's over.
I wish I had thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
I will finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not the essay itself, but all these pernicious questions and explanations of words make me terribly mad!
The weekend's here.
I'll be back next week.
Looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
That was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like this before.
I buy a lot of stuff at that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He started screaming.
I'll be there when I finish my homework.
Clean up a little.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Is Tom out of his mind?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's take another look.
The last time I went to the beach, I burned down.
Back off. Back off.

Do you suspect me?
Luckily, Tom wasn't seriously injured.
In general, children love sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've eaten enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try it your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not into that.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
That's my question.
Hang in there, Tom.
Tom's definitely got the upper hand.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He's got no equal.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious that Tom is sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. Back then, I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so it’s time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't escape.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Down! Down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
It's not something to worry about.
I understand they're a thorn in the eye of people like you, but this is just pathetic.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay, is that a crime?
Anyway, he's definitely coming.
Please leave this place as clean as you would like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
- What's your name?
Copy that.
We got lucky, didn't we?
I'm crying.
I sympathize.
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Did you see anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
She won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.
The book is on the table.
He is a true aristocrat.
I'm doing my job.
It's all quiet again.
I didn't make it.
We do.
Tom goes to school for graphic design.
He lied to you.
Since the message was in French, I couldn't read it.
He's always dissatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You should face reality.
Light waves pass through space and various materials.
We managed to get out on time.
I've had it all.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed.
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not against your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It just happens that way.
Take some.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I'm hungry for this run.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
The spider's tickling me.
He's talking about other people so he'd like them to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
Seems okay to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we're gonna go through the jungle.
Reaction isn't always the best way to do it.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did this.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be reimbursed with a proportionate portion of the annual interest fee.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Well, it's over.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before you try to return the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!
I wasn't nervous about it.
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
We're not gonna let you die.
A lot of things come out of my hands.
He wants to teach his children the importance of work.
He's always been a pig.
I'm not married to Tom.
Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much do I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was quiet for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's exhaled.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch it.
No, no, no, no, no.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone out.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I'm not going to watch TV tonight.
Did Tom pull out the thicker end?
Give me all the money.
Mary gave me a lot of support.
Those are nice shoes.
The girl sees the boy.
We also call Robert "Bob."

You're not funny.
Tom's gone instead of Mary.
It's not yours, it's his.
It happened right here.
He was driving a car down the street.
I don't know Latin very well.
Swimming is a form of exercise.
I don't speak Japanese.
He didn't understand anything.
I'm waiting for my turn.
That's not the main question.
I was shocked by the news.
The girl eats bread.
I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What are you going to do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a squirrel.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with lots of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.
I got off at the wrong bus stop.
I wrote this song just for you.
Your house, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I were rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mailbox?
What do you suggest?
They say love is blind.
I don't have any homework today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch it!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give me that.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was beautiful.
For some strange people, the knowledge of a language is kept secret.
I don't intend to change.
They slowly moved forward.

I survived.
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'm late, aren't I?
Don't blink.
You're blue.
Come visit us soon.
Were you in an accident?
What are you and Tom doing?
Tom's worried about what might happen.
He was an honorable man.
My dad doesn't like football.
I don't know if I'll have time.
I went there voluntarily.
We're all out of alcohol.
A map, please.
My parents don't like my girlfriend.
There was something on the ground.
Children are the flowers of our lives.
Why are we laughing?
My friend lives behind God's feet.
Do you think Tom would like to go fishing with us next weekend?
She yelled at him, but he didn’t hear her.
Water is life.
What are you gonna do today?
He'll probably win the championship.
After silence, what most accurately expresses the inexpressible is music.
Tom looks like a banker.
It's Tom.
It's not over until it's over.
Tom still seems worried.
I didn't see anything.
Mary is a very shy girl.
Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of trouble.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.
It's okay. It's okay.
Does that mean you love me?
It's really pretty bad.
I won't participate.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
Justice must be fully satisfied.
Tom and Mary would be a wonderful couple.
How do you say XXX in Dutch?
Don't do too much!
I'm so fat.
Let's stay inside tonight.
I thought Tom was amazing.
People don't always behave rationally.
I didn't even do that.
Did you pass the exams?
We're gonna have to walk now.
I'll set you free.
I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.
How about we make a Facebook group so we can discuss foreign language learning?
Tom is one of the most interesting guys I've ever met.
Are we in agreement?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom went that way.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be scared of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary, and she smiled.
But why?
Can I have a look at your map?
What's gonna happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.
They've rigged the library with new books.
It's clear.
How about some chocolate cheese?
It's your daughter's birthday today.
Will someone tell me what to do?
It's obviously a typing error.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
Tom wouldn't be pleased.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?
It's pointless to get bored during a student's life.
It just happened again.
It's Christmas.
Tom has naughty hair.
I've seen enough so far.
I hate that one.
We'll miss you so much if you go to Japan.
Tell me what's going to happen.
He lied to us.
We're trying.
Tom will take a look.
Tom ate a sandwich.
Here's what I think.
I want to go.
I could go with you.
The cost of living is rising.
I admit I'm tired.
I'm kidding.
Can you defuse the bomb?
I think Tom could do it.
I need five more minutes.
He sleeps like a baby.
I bet you know who told me that.

Tom's a little worried.
Tom is the best student in the class.
How is this your fault?
My phone number is 9876-5432.

This is a sentence.
Life is sweet.
That's my cat.

We all have to stand up to this.
Where's the toothpaste?
Ms. Klein is in her 80s, but she's still very active.
I'm not sure when Tom's coming back.
Trust me.
This is my computer.

Then our manager came up with a good idea and we made a great plan.
We know enough.
I just want to eat something.
I'm so tired, I can barely keep my eyes open.

Does Tom have any experience?
I don't understand.
Come here for a second.
So what did Tom see?
How much is this umbrella?
I'm on fire at her.
Tom did his homework in the kitchen.
I could kill you now.
Mary used walking sticks to help her with ups and downs on the journey.

This goes on forever.
I don't know why my head hurts.
I assume you already know the answer to that.
The flowers were fully planted.
"How old are you?" "Sixteen."
I like this book the least.

How did you do this?
Tom wasn't as handsome as Marie said he would be.
Give me that other box.
He has an older brother, John.
I'd take it.
Humans are complicated organisms.
They'll know what to do.
Why did you keep quiet all the time?
He took off his clothes.
He saw Layla's reaction.
I have a laptop.
Can I ask you a favor?
He ran away.
It was fun to celebrate together.
I'm afraid I dislocated my right shoulder.
Keep it up!
You really need to take a shower.

I don't want to work under those conditions.
Mayuko was avoiding hard work.
She has short hair.
He drives a pole.
My right hand is numb.
I don't know much about you.
Did you do something?
You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
Everyone appreciates Henry.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.
I feel safe with you.
Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You should talk to me.
The chairman opened the meeting.
It just wasn't our day.
It was raining.

Could you get me some water, please?
It doesn't matter where I am.
Where have you been in Japan?
They're all gone.
I'll teach more diligently.
I'm hurt.
I bought them for you.
Is the world unfair?
None of us saw Tom do it.
Do you love your mother?
I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You mistyped my name.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
You're embarrassing her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His girlfriend didn't give him any support.
I had dinner with him.
I wasn't interested in that.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger of political repression and persecution.
I think your plan is too ambitious.
I don't think the internet is a place for kids.
That was hard for me.
The teacher assigned me the longest chapter.
What did you conclude?
You were made for me.
He needs it.
It's obviously a tipper.
Are we done?
Do I have a visual?
I'm surprised you didn't know Tom crashed into Harvard.
She's my first love.
Have you ever seen one?
Are we safe now?
Tom's not a petty man.
Control yourselves.

Butter is made from milk.
Tell her.
I'd take it.

I'm sure I've seen it somewhere before.
They all smiled.
I didn't know you were so rich.
We listened carefully not to miss a single word.
Do you have trouble understanding what women or young children are telling you?
Looks like Cathy likes music.
He refused to comment.
Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm quitting.
You've disappointed me.
Tom looked furious.
Don't exaggerate.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sorry.
I haven't been home all day yesterday.
I'd be grateful if you'd stay until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, he's just not honest.
The bullet pierced the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.
I think my writing is doing very well.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That helps us a lot.

I'm not worried at all.
It helps.
Dima slept with 25 men in one night and then killed them.
I'm not doing it again.
I didn't think you'd be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one there.
Are you mad about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
Costs will rise soon.
I work at a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
It's always been that way.
I'll go to the sea tomorrow if it's nice.

Tom is named after his father.
That's new.

They work together.
You tried.
The toy store is closed.
I'm taking you to the dance.
I'm a student.
This is my e-mail address.
Tom might be trying to convince Mary to do it.
She makes an elephant mosquito.
You told me not to lie.
He was a member of the social elite rather than a representative of the masses.
I'm terrified.
You tried.
His opinion is reasonable.
Help us reach our goal.
You're sad.
I'm not a rich man.
Can you read that sign in front of us?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't be in a hurry.
Give me the pen.
Your answer is inaccurate.
Just tell Tom I called.
There is no answer to the question of what is best, because it is always individual and depends on the situation.

I was ready for that.
Show me the papers.

I pulled the shit out.
I'm the only one who can do it here.

Tom stopped for a second.
Due to bad weather, the plane was late.
Investigate them.
I'm in better shape than you.
I'm not that worried.
Come on, get up, Tom.
Better a sparrow in the hand than a pigeon in the branch.
Do you have time to have lunch with me?
I want to die with Getter Jaani.

What the fuck?

Did you tell Tom this?

Get everything.
Are these your bags?
I turned down Tom.
I'm not 100% sure.
I'll probably never use this again.
The child continued to cry for hours.
I'd buy that one.
This goes beyond all boundaries.
I have a headache today.
Tell me where you live.
Are we safe now?
I want to go.
Obviously, I was a little shocked.
Don't talk.
French is his mother tongue.
Her words angered him.
I was laughing.
It wasn't too hot.
I'm totally broke.
I almost forgot my passport.
I've been looking for you.
Tom reads a lot.
That's enough!
I hope you're not talking about me.
He who fights with the sword dies with the sword.
You're good to everyone.
I'm usually not that busy on Mondays.
Both of my sisters are teachers.
Looks like it's working.
I don't live to eat, I eat to live.
Tom looked very confused.
I'll be home tomorrow.
The teacher explained the meaning of the word.

During an experiment on the power of observation, Tom couldn't describe a single picture from the wall of his living room, even though he lived there for two years.
I've never seen Tom so busy.
Looks like you haven't been all yours lately.
It's pretty good.
I was definitely lucky.
I hope that's true.
I wonder whose sentence that is.
Tom was buying time.
They all held their breath.
Read this.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember the name.
I'm sure I'll get that tennis match.
That's not funny at all.
I called him.
How many calories does this sandwich have?
Are you ready to take responsibility?
What did you like the most along the way?
I love watching you work.
Tom suggested that Mary go to the doctor.
I hope to visit Beijing as well.
I'm gonna go freshen up.
You're my inspiration.
This time I didn't want to talk to a friend of mine.
Agreed.
Some Mr. Itoh wants to see you.
Be careful.
She'll pay a maximum of $50.
Has anyone called me?
We'll have lunch together at 12:30.
- What's his name?
I'm still a little tired.
I think I'm gonna shit.
I'm a vegetarian.
The picture is in this book.
To strive to maximize one's self-interest, happiness, or security seems very natural to a human being.

It's strange that no one knows the victim.
We're five minutes from here.
I have a few gifts.
Sorry I'm late.
Translation is not nearly as easy as many people think.
Tom would never admit it.
That was just the beginning.
Did you finish your homework?
Over the past few days, I’ve been doing research on making money through a project, but I think all options will require a sudden change in my lifestyle, which is an inconvenient thing to do.
Is everything okay between us?
I've never camped.
I thought the food was great.
I have to plan everything.
Let's change the subject.
We counted the years on the tree that we knocked down and found it was thirty years old.
I'll see you later, Tom.
Would you like some fruit juice?
Let's schedule a meeting.
I pissed him off.
Why can't you get it?
You can't sit next to me.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
Tom still seems shaken.
I'm a very sad man.
Boston is a great city.
We hope people will like it.
Maybe they'll leave tomorrow.
Come here, I want to show you something.
Remodeling.
Tom helped us save a lot of money.
That's interesting.
They're scared of me.
Yesterday I was happy.
You are my sun.
I really liked Tom, too.
He loves rituals.
No one was helping us.
I don't want to go to school.
How long have you been living here?
She divorced her husband.
I'm here.
I want to live in Brazil.
Get help.
I didn't ask you not to do that.
Tom writes a letter to his shirt every week.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
Mary's Tom's daughter unit.
He still has no experience in this job.
Can you help us?
Would you like to cool it down?
Tom encouraged Mary to write about her experiences.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
I've changed my mind.
Based on the information I gave you, what story would you go out with?
Who can't be proud to be a Serb, with their highest historical achievements - the massacre of chieftains and genocides?
That makes it more monotonous.
Do you know how to defuse a bomb?
Will you invite her to the party?
Where did I leave the keys?
I'm a big fan of football.
She came alone.
I can't believe you didn't recognize your own brother.
Tom lost his senses.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
He doesn't miss anything.
Tom will take a look.
I wonder if anyone could help me. I have a cell phone that just shows an error message.
I'm surprised.
They all smiled.
I miss him.
You should spend more time outside and less time inside.
Tom played on the strongest card.
He left his family and moved to Tahiti.
I've played golf with Tom many times.
You underestimate me.
What is your favorite YouTube video?
Millie's listening to music.
The sea is green.
I don't have a guitar.

You can't blame Tom for everything.
Tom said to stay here.
We're close friends.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
We're just getting started.
My friend can speak Hindi fluently.
Yeah, isn't it great?
Please, get out of the way.
I like Tom, but he doesn't like me.
Where can I find a tourist office?
I'm comfortable.
I've already written part of the report.
I just finished it.
We're talking about the wolf, and the wolf's at the door.
Don't stop.
Please come see me tomorrow.
I get the impression he knows the secret.
It was a little weird.
Tom won't pass the exam.
Will you do that to me?
I really enjoyed it.
No one has died... yet.
In the beginning is my end.

Tom, this is my brother, John.
Tom wrote on the ground with a stick.
Don't you want another glass of milk?
Cheer up!
- Who is she?
I bought this yesterday.
The odds are against me.
I'll quit.
The kids are playing outside.
It's all right with you.
Do what you want, I don't care at all.
She expects us to help her.
Who the hell are you?
Call me at any time, I always have a shoulder to cry on.
Did I get fired?
I'm afraid you misunderstood me.
That's good.
I don't want to get you drunk.
Tell me what's going to happen.
Tom's seen a lot.
Thank you for coming!
What is your blood type?
Are we leaving soon?
I found him a book.
They sell sugar in the store.
Tom and Mary watched the sunset together.
You did a great job.
Tom does that sometimes.
Do you have any news for me?
I'm thirsty.
It is our duty to help them.
He didn't do it on purpose.
Thank you Tom for your help.
Simplicity is the highest level of sophistication.

I think Tom's careful.
Oh, no!
I forgot my baby monitor.
Tom's upstairs.
He's kind.
Just relax.
Smoking is prohibited in any part of the restaurant.

What did you do to me?
Enjoy it.
Let me write the steps for you.
He's probably still hiding.
This is the beginning of a new era.
Mary looks cute whatever she's wearing.
Shit happens.
Watch it!
Tom was unable to provide any evidence to support his statement.
Why would Tom come now?
Are you sure this is safe?
You don't even know his name, do you?
We don't have to look from high to poor.
You have a bad temper.
Is this your phone?
I was just on my way.
They divorced after their wedding anniversary.
This house was built by a famous architect.
He took care of the baby.
I bought this yesterday.
I had a very bad day.
The whole country is talking about it.
I'm not a good swimmer.
Does he love me?
Tom made an omelet.
Let's find out for sure.
I'm naughty.
Yesterday I was happy.
The way Mary slams the door, Tom realizes she's sad.
Husbands and wives should help each other as long as they live.
All we need is water.
I wonder if Tom likes dancing as much as Maria.
What would you like to know?
Now's not the best time.
He's not a child anymore.
I'm trying to ventilate the futon at least twice a week.
My education has made me who I am.
Tell her I'm innocent.
Wherever I go, I'm there.
You want to join us?
Leave the book on the top shelf.
You stole my idea.
We could be happy here.
He's very educated.
Tom made it himself.
Do you agree with what Tom wrote in his report?
He's squirming again.
Is that what it takes?
Take it all.
You tried.
Our yacht club has ten members.
I wouldn't hurt him.
Would you be able to do that?
Mom, that aunt and man are holding hands, they're very good friends, aren't they?
Can I walk you home?
I just saw the Saudi ambassador resign.
Be careful.
Maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'll drive.
Don't open it.
I had a problem solving this problem.
I don't want Tom to see me naked.
I have one brother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Contact Tom.
We've been here all day.
You know I can't give you that kind of information.
I didn't do that.
I have a few friends.
I have to look for her.
I can't wait.
I'll check.
Tom was shocked.
Just a moment, please.
We'll get you one.
Tom wants to know when you're done.
Give me a call.
Tom still looks shaken.
That's what the doctor ordered.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
Tom knows what's coming.
I'm impressed.
"If P, then Q" is logically equivalent to "(No P) and/or Q".
He speaks English.
I'm writing a message to Tom right now.
That's an exception.
Tom came in a little earlier than usual today.
Do you believe in eternal life?
I could eat a horse.
I've never actually met Tom.
Which is easier?
He demanded an increase.
Fadil wasn't in the house.
I've never noticed that before.
This should work.
Where have you been all afternoon?
What are you supposed to do?
I've always liked Tom better.
Where was Tom hiding?
What can't you tell me?
Tom bought the newspapers and read them on the train on the way to work.
I have house spirits.
Look at that.
We'll save this piece of cake for Tom.
You're ridiculous.
Are Tom and Mary really married?
Horses sleep standing up.
Let me try another one.
Work slowly.
I didn't do that either.
Snorri Sturluson's stories tell, among other things, that Christianity spread in Norway with violence.
Answer me right now.
Make yourself at home!
The students did not know how to respond.
Did you know that before?
I'll try to convince Tom to do it.
Am I that different?
I'm confused.
I assumed you were busy.
How long have you been running?
This elegant gold-plated chain with hearts is a necklace that will "shock your world".
Your answer is correct.
I love Leanne.
It all happened at lightning speed.
Do we have to tell Tom?
It was raining heavily.
There's milk in the fridge.
Do you really think I'm selfish?
You can sit next to me.
Take some more.
You're irrational.
I'm angry.
Don't argue with me.
The dinner was held at the White House.
You should leave the planning to me.
You can avoid a lot of problems if you just do it right the first time.
Mary jumped out of the window into the river.
She was crying.
The doctor's on his way.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
He invited her on a date.

Who are we?
Does Tom really speak French?
The bill, please.
Broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables.
I'm terrified.
I'm doing great.
Can you enjoy this book?
The capital of Serbia is Belgrade.
Did you expect anything else to happen?
John and Mary walk around holding hands.
Don't worry, I'll translate it for you.
Where did I go wrong?
Tom's trying to help.
I've missed so many opportunities.
We heard her crying.
It helped me a lot.
You don't have to scream, I'm not deaf!
Give me another example.
Tom still has a little time.
We don't have a choice.
Painless is boring.
Tom was more than generous.
She's violent right now, she needs to be avoided.
I'm just rigged.
I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
Tell him I'm innocent.
What are you gonna do with all that money?
I'll visit him in a few weeks.
Italy is not Greece.
It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go to see Tom?
What's that?
He's surrendered.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is one big, friendly dog in a small room, every time he wags his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works in the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look how big it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late for the accident.
I always eat fruit and oatmeal for breakfast.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom made it clear that he didn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We recommend that water quality is checked once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people when they have to draw your attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes or your looks, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I've been thrown into great nothingness.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of barking dogs.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a very long time.
This story tells us some interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Would you mind if I interrupted you for a moment?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't mind them, they won't mind you either.
Good intentions are important.
I've already thought about it.
Men are children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me feel guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking around.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something specific?
Welcome back.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I have no idea.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Put your clothes on.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he was going to do it.
Look again.
Do you speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters consider Maria the most suitable candidate for a new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought flowers.
I'm sure you'll be fine.
She's back from the hospital.
I probably won't read Tom's report.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What's going to happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make a place.
He is also very well known in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you gonna do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they might come true.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's going to come with us?
Sounds like you learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
As it came, so it went.
Give him time.
Who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91% of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very rude.
Don't forget to write a date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you have read that?
Try again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Can you keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move quietly.
When the fire broke out, he was asleep.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought of that.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
That wouldn't have liked it.
I have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you gonna do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands at sea.
I've never had a problem falling asleep.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went for a walk.
Is there any other way?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the invested capital was several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys were laughing.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't completely agree with you.
It's a beautiful day.
Are you saving this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Mary's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be back late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I will send a letter to my brother who lives in Sapporo.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a teacher.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hates us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I sent anyone a letter.
What's the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write the report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works about nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what Tom had to say.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, it's not his.
We have four French lessons every week.
Let's start now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Dania give him the money.
Alone is our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom's upstairs.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical Gothic church.
It was a presentation that appealed to the audience.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you very much!
Keep the change.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom turn himself in?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom wasn't doing what he should be doing.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom chased the flies away.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to deny it.
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup is on the table.
That really pisses me off.
Is it still light outside?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the branch.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to take a look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
I wish I had thought of that.
I drink milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through a window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope Tom gets back safely.
I have no idea what was going on in his head to reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How does it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean up now.
You've tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom's tough or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us ate a potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
All right, how about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I made a promise.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be a lezilebovich.
This is how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like to work.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks dark for Edmond Dantes, after becoming a victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're irrational.
My French is shit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
Mother chose this curtain.
We're both not as rich as we'd like to be.
It's a hit.
Can you let Tom know I came by?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Can you cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
With one foot in the grave
Tom just told me the opposite.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom is dissatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's as crazy as electricity.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Don't drink water from a dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I sang to you today, I wrote.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who is your favorite wrestler?
- Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls don't exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do it.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's really an idiot.
Oh, yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's quite a problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to do things on the go.
You're working too hard.
This one's really cool.
Not a word to anyone.
I really enjoyed it.
You can trust that to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Kedah.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
That river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this piece.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
- Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It is not taught in school.
Is it clean?
I don't want to go out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish cannot live outside the water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Move it!
Please wait a little longer.
I don't want to do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every bit!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could fight back.
I just want to get away.
Denmark continued to follow Fadil's example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let them miss such a good chance.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I've been looking for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the plane was delayed.
Can I get your dictionary?
My fluent knowledge of the language is enough for many situations, but not for expressing my, often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a nerd.
Turn around for a moment, will you?
The book's on the shelf.
I often feel a heartbeat.
Tom's undercover.
I don't blame you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know that girl from somewhere.
I nodded once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry to always bother you.
Tom's risking everything.
He is a man of power.
That's wonderful!
I'm shabby.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's weird that the postman hasn't come yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are popular among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'm going to buy a boat soon, what kind of insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not an American, he's an Englishman.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Did you ever get a speeding ticket?
I'll be upstairs right away.
We've got to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His misfortune taught me a lot.
Are we ready to go?
- Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote many works of music for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh in a bicycle accident in France on Sunday.
Where there are a lot of grandmothers, they're kids.
Tom is tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just whipped cream on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were unbelievable.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes creaked.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job's already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a sucker.
Don't move!
The accident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop that?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew Tom didn't know how to speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's useless.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the other side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is famous for its luxurious dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often bullies in childhood.
Meet me at Tom's.
After much deliberation, I ended up doing things randomly.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves on words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look how big it is!
The living truth.
You're very careless.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to leave.
Now is a good time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom came out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
Tom visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and what to write.
Tom is ruthless.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was exaggerating.
Termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This should work.
You've let me down.
You don't judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was going to be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
Then what are your plans?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I spoke to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
It's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like socializing.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
That smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even more.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I have plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught at your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom's gonna be fine.
You're important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't get carried away.
I'm used to not liking anyone.
The brakes are creaking.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see Tom leave?
Be careful.
How would you translate that?
I'm willing to pay you well to do it.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
Many admire him.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Mary was giggling.
Let's sit.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your kids have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary sent him.
Go take a swim with Tom.
He's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A woman's chiffon is not complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the toilet?
Happy Resurrection!
Tom helped me save a dinar by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything but admire him for his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's worked his whole life.
Go! Go!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom that.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You win!
That's a bad sign.
I misunderstood.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with kids.
I'll be late.
I had lunch in a hurry.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You're always lying to me.
Just in time!
I want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he was never on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a rock.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
No matter how little we know about her origins, at least we can be sure she's an Evangelion pilot.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with typewriters.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom sees nothing wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What's tomorrow?
I've always known that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When the cat is gone, the mouse wheel is running.
We need it from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and Spain by the King.
It's Alice's book.
Shall we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
"I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie drinks milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm loyal.
Can we order, please?
What does he do?
By the way, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They were laughing at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I'm not going to Bustom with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a sucker.
It's like old times.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
That doesn't look like you.
He's always here between 5:00 and 6:00.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like stubborn people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season starts in June.
You always do.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He has two cars.
He'll probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I see, but I don't see.
I'm bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We are close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was completely drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.
That house belongs to him.
My father listens to classical music.
- Who?
How many people live on Earth?
I'm a little worried now.
Come back anytime.
We're from Russia.
Let it be.
What should I do my free time.
We have to keep working.
We had a terrible fight.
Who ate the last doughnut?
Are you free tonight?
If I love you, what does it matter to you?
You don't speak English.

I'm sorry, the relationship is still busy.
Tom just told me the opposite.
He has one son and two daughters.
Here's your bag.
You're the boss.
He took Jane out to dinner.
Who broke the cup?
You're just wasting your time.
What Tom said can't be applied to this situation.
There are several reasons.
What are you going to do from now on?
I'm really proud of that.
Stop worrying so much.
What's the matter with you?
I like grapes.
What are you supposed to do?
It didn't matter to me.

I got off the train.
You promised you'd help me.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I feel good now.
To be honest, I don't know.
I saw the bus.
She can't stop us.
You're saying you deliberately hid your good side?
Tom's not the one who drank all the milk.
I'm not getting into it.
Tell him.
Do you speak English?

Everyone says I look like my dad.
Come by early so we can talk about the plans.

How old are you really?
You'd be crazy to stay.
You tried.
Tom decided to sell the car.
Who the hell are you?
A new snow avalanche occurred on the way to Echeskaret in the Oda municipality in Hordaland on Tuesday night and it is not known if anyone was trapped in the avalanche.
Are you Uighur?
I'm claustrophobic.
I can't fix the car myself.
Zini!
Please, hurry up.
Tom nodded his head.
Should we tell someone?
He was flooded by the cold.
I'm getting better.
That's what Tom thought.
Don't be mad.
His memory loss is more of a mental than a physical problem.
He's exhaled.

Fish, please.
Aren't you done yet?
I'll have to think about that,
Tom was talking about music.
Everything has its price.
Yesterday was warm.
There were so many people on the train, I had to stand.

When can Tom come home?
Did you do it on purpose?
I see a reflection of my face in the window glass.
Go talk to Tom.
Make a decision.
There's no use trying to talk him into it.
I was thinking about my family.

That should save us some money.
He worked ten hours continuously.
This one's pretty cool.
That publishing company is solvent.
Choose one.
How did you find out where Tom was?
Stop looking for a prince on a white horse, they don't exist.
It's his, isn't it?
He'll probably still be angry.
They can no longer be recognized.
I'm too old for something like this.
I don't fall for that.
He's a fake, isn't he?
I'd agree.
The price doesn't matter.
You deserve a reward.

Why should I listen to you?
It never dared to happen.
I'm leaving school.
How old are you?
What kind of movie is this? Is it popular?
Did that work out for me?
Turn right.
It would take me forever to explain everything.
I haven't worked in many years.
What a beautiful house!
I haven't forgotten him.
Can you take me home?
What do you have in mind?

It's clear.
Keep digging.
Why all this confusion?
Tom's confidence was shattered when his boss took him off in front of his colleagues.
I'm not worried at all.
We've got a problem.
Tom knew all that.
Will you do that to me?
I probably won't watch this.
Stop worrying.
Come in.

Quietly move.

They were all young once.
It wasn't easy for me.
Bye-bye!

You'll save time if you listen carefully to my instructions.
Do you have any idea about my life?
He was tired of reading.
Can we order now?
The code is Muriel.
We can't stop here.
Tom didn't think for a moment that he was trying to convince Mary to do it.
Don't argue with me.
Hey, give me a chance.
There is also an ethical question that has been raised about this.

What did you do here?
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Tom's a little worried.
He likes to make a donkey out of a mosquito.
I totally disagree with that.
The boy's skinny.
It's a routine thing.
He never survived the death of his son.
He's trying.
- Good evening.
Will someone tell me what to do?
Tom writes better than I do.
Nothing's going to work for me today.
I'm responsible.
You're doing good.
That's what Tom tells me.
Tom pressed the switch.
I need my kids.
The teacher wrote something on the board, but I couldn't read it because it wasn't enough.
Of course, Tom's wrong.
I didn't wash my hair.
I can close my eyes.
He has to buy his son a new bike.
My dear, do not be shy.
Are you afraid of death?
Are you hungry?
Tom is still frustrated.
If you try, you'll make it.
We have enough seats for everyone.
That was a false alarm.
Tom's learning programming.
Anyone can get a wig.
Tom wouldn't let me answer Mary's question.
What did you say?
I don't know the answer.
Whenever I find something I like, it's always too expensive.
It's a cat.
This advertisement is very offensive.
I want Tom out by noon.
Tom looked astonished.
Tom wasn't very energetic.
Nancy's afraid of dogs.
It won't help you if you're worried.
I'm afraid I can't let you do that.
Did you go to see Tom?
I was looking for you.
A cat is not a man.
So this is how it ends?
What's this?
I'll take the car.
Tom likes to write.
Tom didn't know what question to ask.
I'm just doing my duty.
He sleeps like a baby.
I'm taking the day off.
Are you blaming me?
That doesn't like me.
That ruined the mood at the table yesterday.
Stay in the house.
I thought you were going to Boston by bus.
Tom still has a little time.
Fuck you! Fuck you!
Maybe I won't sleep tonight.
You're wasting your time.
I'd like to know what's going on here.
How many pairs of socks do you have?
I've never had trouble falling asleep.
It's locked.
I'll figure something out.
An honest man can't do that.
Take care!
I'm not trying to predict the future.
What are you doing at this hour?
I'm early.
Are they all strong?

It's time.
What's this gonna buy me?

How did you do that?
I won't tell anyone else.
That's great!
How do you know so much?
Tom sighed.
I picked up my luggage.
I'm scared.

Tom's not here, he's already gone.
We're taking the bus, we're gonna have to walk now.
Don't go near my girl.
I'm sorry I tried it at all.
The pizza girl and Mr. Porridge were walking in the woods.
Either way, you're wrong.
The redheads are driving me crazy!
I'm not bitter at all.
A man has many desires that he actually does not even want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their realization would be a bitter disappointment for him. Such a desire is also the desire for eternal life. If it had been fulfilled, the man would have become completely sick of lifelessly desire.
Let me sleep another ten minutes.
