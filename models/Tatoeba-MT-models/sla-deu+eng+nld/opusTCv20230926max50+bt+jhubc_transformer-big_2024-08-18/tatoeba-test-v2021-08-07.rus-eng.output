White pawn on f3, black pawn on e6, white pawn on g4, black queen on h4 - matt! In chess circles it is jokingly called "foolish matt".
White: the baton on a1, the pawn on b6, the king on c8. Black: the pawns on a7 and b7, the king on a8, the elephant on b8. White put the opponent in the position of Zugzwang, placing the baton on a6, after which the blacks have only two options: take the baton on a6 or move the elephant on bh8 to any other field diagon
