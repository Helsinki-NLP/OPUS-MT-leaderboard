Barack Obama to receive Nobel Peace Prize as fourth U.S. president
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to claim the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a $1.4 million check, among other things, for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
First, he will visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, which in October selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The pair are scheduled to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony, at which Obama will take on the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to win the award in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will be talking about the Afghan war when he receives the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that he is taking the prize as the president, who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago was further boosted by the deployment of more troops to Afghanistan, which will not be forgotten by any of his critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check for 10 million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The packed program will then take the president and his wife to a banquet where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the prime minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
From the start, Obama was more cautious about the price.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not just a price for him, but for all those who seek the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a “call for action.”
Protector of Nature Accused of Extortion
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civil society of the Society of Nature Protection Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of blackmail.
On several occasions in the past year, he appealed to some construction proceedings, demanding money from investors for the withdrawal of the appeal, said Litomerice police spokeswoman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka is the chairman of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Conservation Society.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell very much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort packaging from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find a suitable trash can.
I do not want to say that in Brno, waste is not classified at all.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all by the number of trash cans for such waste.
Have you ever tried throwing a PET bottle into a collection bin in the center?
He's a finished best man, especially when it takes time and nerves.
The only place I have found so far is on Moravské n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> opposite Potrefen<0xC3><0xA1> Hus.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but it doesn't seem like much.
Not to mention that there is no honey in other parts of the waste sorting.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort out waste.
Out of laziness.
They are far away from the trash.
I'm not surprised.
After the party, I offered to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any colored bins in sight on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place on my way to the shawl.
The waste was overflowing.
It’s still the center of Brno that the city represents the most, isn’t it?
But ecology and some aesthetics probably do not interest the Brno socialists very much.
They would rather buy the city a hockey extra league that would embarrass us all over the country than buy a few more containers and offer to sort other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing on the Internet and official statistics.
According to the data of EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
"Paroubko's" budget took money for pensions and sick
After the left has added money to the budget for pensions, sickness and construction savings, despite the government’s opinion of farmers or officials.
But also on interest on public debt or on international litigation.
It will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists promoted the increase to some groups, they relied on the government to additionally borrow sensitive expenditures, pensions or sick pay. "It's just putting problems into the future, putting mines down," Janota says.
The borrowed money pays ever higher interest and sometimes has to come back.
The state has no choice as to where to go.
If they do not reduce the social benefits or running costs of the state, they must raise taxes.
To all those to whom the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later their children.
People do not have to worry about pensions or sick leave, from which 1.8 billion have disappeared, they get it.
But at the cost of more debt to the state, next year it won’t be just 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow more and more rapidly, and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, next year there will also be five billion for the completion of highways and railways.
These are mostly already contested and arranged sections, which can not be redesigned and possibly discounted.
Mostly to conserve, which is also not free.
It means delaying or stopping thirty large constructions, and the use of European money is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money would be solved in a Solomonic way – it would reach into the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ dividends, which the state owns for the most part, and add to the transport fund from them.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is not at all a bottomless source.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ budgeted $18 billion.
Every year, dividends are paid for the elimination of environmental damage, supplemented with a pension account or serve as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of transfers does not end there.
Almost three billion euros have gone into the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses on litigation, even on building savings.
Whether this will happen without the money is not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the ministry or, in the worst case, reach the government’s budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the already launched two billion-dollar Treasury project, which is supposed to allow online monitoring of what individual authorities spend on.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans in the future count on a mobile phone, on which the user will press a single button to switch between different operating systems.
The unveiled plans sound promising.
With just one key press, you can transfer from Windows Mobile to Android within seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware is aiming for, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to keep two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was shown for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the above-mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran side by side.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
The bare slopes do not only worry the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains, you can still find free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but so far they are afraid to make a binding order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud," Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info information portal, said.
Anyone who wants a New Year's Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly as they wish, should no longer hesitate with the order.
Who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is second only to him, he can still try to wait a few days.
<0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v hoteliers offer mostly week stays on New Year’s Eve.
I think they're going to try to turn them in for a while, but then they're going to let them in and go for a shorter period of time.
And then the free rooms will be draining away quickly," Jandura said.
Free beds in all winter terms are still offered by the Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas stays,” said Ingtours CEO Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e Mountains can still be offered by the Vrchlab<0xC3><0xAD> travel agency, but there are fewer available places.
The first 14 days of February go well on sale, the remaining winter terms are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting if they think.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will also sell out," Schiefert said.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou are slightly better than last year.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year's Eve and Christmas we have the last few places.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and February is also selling well,” Karel Rada, the director of the best hotel in Pecs, said.
Hotel Omnia near the central parking lot in Janske L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> has eighty percent of New Year's Eve stays.
On the contrary, half of the beds are still available at the latest Janskol<0xC3><0xA1>ze<0xC5><0x88> hotel.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, which is already occupied by about sixty percent.
February is a little weaker so far, but once the snow falls, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater amount of snow, the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e hoteliers have to let the taste pass.
On Thursday, it is supposed to cool down, if there is any precipitation, then the mountains should be snowy.
But then the warming will come again, informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové department of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
US: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comical with what school effort Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, who he himself considered to be the stupidest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it through a copycat from the Bush Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: “A New Way Forward.”
Three years ago, he criticised Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to a civil war-torn Iraq as “irresponsible and catastrophic in its consequences.”
However, the months that followed showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only possible and highly successful one, so much so that there is no mention of Iraq in the news reports today.
It did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked to increase the military contingent by field commanders, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, even in spite of subordinationist practices, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general by 10,000 troops.
From Europe he managed to squeeze out the promise of another 5,000, although he initially counted himself at least 10.
The most problematic part of Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end the process in three years.
Many doubt that a half-increase will produce the same fruit as the process in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well-ordered, its leaders honoring the agreements.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are ill-prepared to change their master every day as they see fit.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a potemkin village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the lack of clarity of the situation, which is further complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of an “accessible state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem too real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into the war to “return home quickly” will cause a miracle here, can only be a truly romantic soul, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in combat operations in Afghanistan is approaching a minus.
European politicians do not know and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the United States will be faced with an overly difficult question of whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to answer it just at the time when, according to Obama, America will proceed to a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold no earlier than in five years.
In addition, the shares can be taken away from managers if they take excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after it set aside nearly $17 billion (about $300 billion) in rewards for the first three quarters of this year.
The company’s total rewards for this year, according to Reuters, are likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today.
High remuneration in the banking sector has become a hot political issue in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately <0xC2><0xA3>712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines except physics.
A record five women in Stockholm today took over the Nobel Prize for literature from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden this year.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was physics.
The prize was awarded to Charles Kao for optical fiber research and to George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines, or astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of earning a financial reward.
For each category, it amounts to 10 million Swedish crowns (approximately 25 million CZK).
If there are more than one of them, they share the reward.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to U.S. President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, as he is only at the beginning of his path and, moreover, he is at the head of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defense of his policy, he added that wars are in a certain situation necessary to win peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he disagrees with the form of the state budget for next year, as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly Janot’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
In his opinion, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
President's spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to hold talks with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
Under the budget law, which Klaus will now receive for signature, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, the House of Commons approved proposals by the left to move money and raise money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government has blamed social democracy’s proposals for secretly raising the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen, which is why the question of the future of Fischer’s official cabinet is being raised, the formation of which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, the CSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially eliminates a package of austerity measures that Fischer’s government put in place in the fall to stop the state’s indebtedness.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget law, said at a business breakfast on Monday that politicians had long neglected the “serious problem” of “unsustainable deficits” in public finances.
He said he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government, which could rely on a wider consensus of political parties, could bring improvements, the president said.
ODS President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek, reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek by saying that the budget deficit that the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek government has prepared for this year, which will exceed CZK 200 billion, is frightening.
On Wednesday, the CSSD described the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The people were also pleased.
Clint Eastwood's Mandela was played by Morgan Freeman.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticism that American actors play the lead roles.
It tells the story of sports, race and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, had asked him if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I told him, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s Million Dollar Baby boxing drama, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the abolition movement, which eventually became a slave, the fictional president of the United States and even a god in the Divine Evan, but rarely someone who is still alive and is as important to many people as Mandela.
A former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and later became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unify the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong on a global scale among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the screen.
“I had no other goal than to play this role to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I press your hand, I take your energy, it's being transferred, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
It was a great surprise to him in the end when he first met Pienaar at his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'I look a lot bigger in a movie.'
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real designs under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated received positive reviews and also talked about the ambitions for the Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his review in the words: “It was a very good story, a very well made film.”
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76% positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway unveiled: the Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin could be observed over Norway.
Russia’s Defense Ministry has admitted to testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was again unsuccessful, and the missile, known as the Bulava type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for both Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the tests of the rocket did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava mostly did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, "Bulav" is already described as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but shines
This was the 13th attempt at the beginning.
At the end of the flight, there was again a technical damage to the apparatus.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, Bulava took off from the Dmitri Donskoy nuclear submarine, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unspecified flying object was indeed a malfunctioning "Bulava".
After all, the Norwegians from the first moment did not doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals are defending themselves and saying that it is impossible to speak unequivocally of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket survived and the accident hit only the third.
In previous cases, the engines crashed in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch was made without a mistake, only six of the thirteen were considered unsuccessful by the Ministry of Defence.
The success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and thus still claims that the Bulava will one day fly without problems and that it will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again appear in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably play in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of 40 in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to finalize some formalities, the AP quoted coach of the Moscow club Sergey Nemchinov as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players, said N<0xC4><0x9B>m<0xC4><0x8D>inov.
Fetisov will become Russia’s oldest professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL, at the age of fifty-one, he played a full season for Hartford's legendary striker Gordie Howe, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, triumphed at the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he lifted the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai agrees to trade unions. Cancels all overtime
The management of the No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice car manufacturer Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the union is expected to agree on another shift on Saturday.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts to be made, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who will work Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
This will be paid back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ek, the company decided to change the way of motivating employees during the proposed overtime.
They will either have to pay the overtime surcharge or they can choose a replacement holiday on December 28, thus extending the Christmas holidays by one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all Saturday shift employees will receive paid fares and lunches.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and pressing point in terms of the comments and complaints of trade unionists, as well as protesting employees, who last week spontaneously stopped production, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the car manufacturer were forced to work almost every day after an eight-hour shift for another two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions cancel the strike emergency
The next meeting between the company and the union is expected to take place on Friday morning.
The head of trade unions, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the carmaker escalated last week, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opted that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
In their strike emergency on Monday, trade unions also demanded that workers who cut production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, unions are demanding that the company reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5,000 crowns for it this year.
Hyundai’s No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice carmaker now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production in November last year.
By September this year, it produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Works Even on 'Perennial' HIV Viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Life Sciences Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that a substance called metallocarbons acts on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal carbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Betrayal and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, no mature infectious virus particles would have formed.
If we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of HIV protease agents was tested in the test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants derived from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metal carbonates on a common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metalocarbonates interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Biochemistry and the Institute of Organic Biology.
The fight over the budget. The ODS infiltrated Fischer, he defends himself
ODS chief Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS statements strong statements.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, the ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out.
The House of Commons on Wednesday approved the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House raised money for salaries of civil servants, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s complaint against the proposals for social democracy was that they were secretly raising the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, so satisfying the government’s wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget proviso.
Disappointment and futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will assess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to step down in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could have looked different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering a further stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out for further fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the nominees of the CSSD, which enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sick leave, pensions, or an amendment to the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the ODS did not sin
It's a matter of Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy positions who voted for TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
He stressed that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the level of the public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he will rely on the left-wing majority, which is currently in the House."
But then he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is up to date, I will do it, Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the House, who was nominated to the government by the Civic Democrats.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for a meeting of the European Council.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS resigned.
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House, unless the Prime Minister explicitly asked the members of the Civic Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS in the political negotiations on the budget was not bothered by the absence of the party chairman in the parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't notice that my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevism of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself responded.
Under the new <0xC4><0x8C>D rules, fewer trains will go for almost the same fare
As of 13 December, Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less-exhausted expressways and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of the new timetable.
Most of the tariffs, including the basic and customer fare, will not change.
For example, residents of Ostrava will get more possibilities of connection to the capital, the railways will add one set of pendolino to this line.
On the contrary, the speedboat will stop going to Bratislava.
There will also be fewer express trains on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, and direct connections between Prague and Letohrad will be significantly restricted.
Of the regions, the railways plan the largest reduction in transport in the Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> Region, by a total of 8%, Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice are also cancelled and the operation of several express trains on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to some days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, today the Milovices have to cross into Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the suburban Esko system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Railway Station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce several connections of SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava via the Pendoline as of December 13.
This year’s regional railway bill: 200 million more
Fast orders and pays the Ministry of Transport, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable losses will give the railways next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals order the regions, in total they will pay for them next year eight billion crowns, with less than three billion to the regions will be contributed by the state.
Regional trains are 200 million more expensive this year.
For locals and fast trains, the railways have a new ten-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The railways praised the system, and therefore apparently did not increase the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will occur only for one-day network tickets of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap online tickets eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will be increased from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance travelled, so far it has been uniform for travel between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine militants still detain more than 50 people, children released
In the south of the Philippines, militants kidnapped 75 people, including some elementary school pupils and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants are said to be using the hostages as a living shield when escaping from police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP news agency, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially pursued the kidnapper because of the violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in the province of Maguindanao, martial law has been declared over the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23rd massacre related to the elections to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
They resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film Invictus (the official title in Czech is Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, is coming to American cinemas.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom he said Mandela himself chose for his portrayal years ago.
The male side role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the release of the film in cinemas, they arise from the feedback of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mwez, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when South Africa is at the peak of preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media is shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the Black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the responses to the new film in South Africa are generally positive for now, despite numerous reservations about the main roles of "flawed" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to draw on his energy, as they say, in an interview after the film’s ceremonial premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can remember Mandela's personality and message in the film.
It is the story of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on a book by British author John Carlin, The Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made the Nation portrays a South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to cement two racial and for many years mutually delimited population groups, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the role of an actor in the South African national rugby jersey on the field of the World Cup, which was then won by South Africa.
For entering the lawn in a jersey that is almost sacred in South Africa, Mandela, fourteen years ago, reaped the great ovation of a predominantly white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to bring people together once again, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is yet to be seen.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a football fan who fled the country to Britain, revealed in a recent interview with LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Transformer on fire in Lounsk for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was caught in the morning by a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps in the distribution plant near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, a spokesman for the Ust's regional fire department, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted to burn the transformer, but later they reconsidered the idea and put out a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical fault, the internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to Pavla Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the company, the accident does not jeopardize the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, it will be possible to accurately quantify it only after the end of the fire.
The destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of operation of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
According to Soni Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for Northern Bohemia, the electricity supply was not interrupted, the functioning of households, authorities or companies was not affected by the fire of the substation.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, restores and develops 39 power stations with 67 transformers that transfer electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system and a 4,339-kilometre-long line route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura filed a criminal complaint for defamation of three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD governors
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, will file a criminal complaint today for defamation against three social-democratic governors.
Michael Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from the Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, Governor of the Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura stated this in the 20 Minutes Radio Journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
In the end, all regions signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three commanders are attacking us and talking about picking raisins, while we have only brought an offer for what they wanted.
He claims that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
It is a defamation against the Student Agency, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>lu.
At the same time, he said that he had evidence from all regions that they had not acted in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be another continuation of Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and of my country, and I will also call upon other governors to do the same.
I assume that even on this occasion it will become clear that it is Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who is manipulating the public on the issue of regional railway transport and using false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in advertising, which will warn about the disadvantageous step of the regions.
He told the radio magazine that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and would like to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be directed against corruption.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and did not issue tenders for the order of about 150 billion crowns.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such an act is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>urov was threatened by the MP for the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know which gentleman he is, I will not say his name, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urn<0xC3><0xA1>l Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococci from January will break the established customs.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time optional.
However, there have been rumors that mandatory vaccinations would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal diseases are climaxing.
The Institute of Medicine has already set the maximum prices for vaccines that will be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also very clear about the vaccination process.
The New Vaccination
Vaccines for August children
From January onwards, pneumococcal babies born on or after August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of vaccination.
Whoever started the vaccine last year or earlier must pay for another booster.
The first dose of vaccination must be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families volunteered to vaccinate their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose or more.
Vaccination of the youngest children requires four doses.
In total, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend on vaccination doses of 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state for all surface vaccination of children has given about 500,000 a year.
The paid vaccination was introduced by the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal disease causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections, including inflammation of the brain and blood poisoning.
According to the survey, up to 28 children under the age of 10 will die of pneumococcal infections in our country in a year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid surface vaccination of children against pneumococcal diseases in about 40 countries.
Will vaccinations be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that in the future this vaccination may be mandatory.
Since January, it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the head of the civil society association Naglas, suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been achieved.
I think this is the path we must take now, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the process of vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
At the moment we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>en.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, president of the Society of Professional Children’s Practitioners, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of overvaccinations could be considered "In a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we understand quite well the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," Cabrnoch said.
Experts expect to have their infants vaccinated against pneumococcal disease by more than 80 percent of fresh parents next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is the first surface vaccination of children that is paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the substance themselves.
But this has to do with the concerns of child health practitioners who are concerned about buying vaccines.
According to the original plan, vaccines were to be bought by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
Some MPs, however, feared that insurance companies could “take money out of health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to purchase the substances and wait for the insurance companies to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won’t be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
Son of American artist ‘stealing in museum’
Frank Frazetta, the son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta, was accused of trying to rob paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father’s museum.
Pennsylvania police said Alfonso Frank Frazette was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazette and the other man used a excavator to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81 years old, is famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr Frazette Jr. could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta, a junior swearing-in, aged 52, said he had done so at his father’s direction, “to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings into the malting rooms,” the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied any such permission, as the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax hikes
The ministers advocated tax hikes and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Tory people “wasted” the opportunity to show that they were serious about delaying the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
Even the chancellor was put on fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly an increase of 0.5% in social insurance and a 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Anger at Social Security
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of "problems".
Social security is on the rise – an increase of around <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year – which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax, while there should be a focus on economic recovery.
This increase, limited to more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social insurance will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75 % this year
Fifty percent tax on bankers’ bonuses
Increase of 1% of corporate tax for depreciation in small companies
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind farms
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to the State Financial Administration, some income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and some income of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will decrease by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will increase by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers announced that their goal of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall on the 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax hikes and spending cuts would be “a drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should take place at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth — which will affect the amount of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced — must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise earlier amounts.
In his opinion, he said the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
"A Wasted Opportunity"
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "indebtedness crisis", have called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan over the next six years intolerable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be reimbursed, they added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place until June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they missed it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election, if we win them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts, as opposed to the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by tax hikes and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, and argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will increase and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - could lead to the chancellor being blamed for the election campaign if the money was difficult to get back a year later.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people are in dire need of it and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
"Suspected Budget"
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term cuts.
The acclaimed Institute of Budget Studies said the Chancellor’s figures suggest significant cutbacks in many areas, potentially in the future including transport, higher education, and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important statements will come after the election if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to account revisor Deloitte.
"That was a report on a suspicious provisional budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates 'U.S. Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists at a prison in Pakistan.
The men were jailed for attacking a house in Sargoda, eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said.
The FBI said it was investigating whether the men were the same men who were reported missing in the past month at their home in the US state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about getting information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the rest are from Yemen.
“If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the detention and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are really missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington, D.C., said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house had always been the focus of local police interest and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, but said the U.S. must “cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in unveiling the infrastructure of terrorism that is thriving in recruiting and training individuals.”
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Rejection of amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report details "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was in danger of being raped.
Iran has denied the above criticism of the report on human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed following the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street dismantling since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Dozens of them were incarcerated and prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent John Leyne, now based in London, said earlier in the protests Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared some forms of torture illegal and banned them from being carried out at Karizak Correctional Facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legitimate authority has been tolerated, as our correspondent has stated.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted a 26-year-old computer science student, Ibrahim Methari, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook” and protesting against the election results.
"They often beat me in the face," he said in his testimony.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, my neck, my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iranian senior government officials have denied allegations of rape, but have admitted that torture took place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that Iran’s parliament and judiciary had set up committees to investigate post-election riots and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn a monument in Bristol into a piste for the race.
The piste for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the downhill run in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge 100 meters long downhill run.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the piste, but it was really depressing.
It was a beautiful sight of the flashing lights of the city below.

Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading alarming reports about the alleged Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate – and whether they would integrate – into one of the continent’s most open secular societies.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author’s latest work, “Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves” (2006), this elegant and discussed study of controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a wider and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes now caring for 5 <0xC3><0xB7> 6 million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage in a mosque or town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular contentious issues that are being debated and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known people, including Tariq Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are inclined to believe that this is the counter-pole of Selafi — supporters of the purist Sunni Islam, affiliated in Saudi Arabia — this group is small but affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so vehemently defends the lay public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
The view is that Muslims are probably less experienced in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "tightening of the screws of values".
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The most hopeless prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet’s environment.
The limiting ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers as they awaken.
In the book "On Thin Ice," Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, tells the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to seize the polar bear.
Meeting Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old mercenary who fought only the musketeer’s flask is a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, who were swimming behind the bodies of their mothers who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed in a circus tent.
Even today, zoo fences typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely appropriate: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indians are hunted on skis, all armed with powerful attacking gloves to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, After the Ice, Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and unsatisfying account of science for the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse of how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have all the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice was moving.
Submarines in the Cold War then mapped the shifting compartments as they floated them.
Satellite surveys and vast fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to the fearless individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the sedimentary system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that shrinks when it freezes.
But from the height of the bear to the microscopic wonders of the interior, all this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months...that could be us
6,000 Marines lay wreaths on graves in Arlington
Petty Officer De'Angello Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day of distant tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me the respect that I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at a cemetery of veterans in several wards at a funeral service in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves during a memorial service in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesterians do not seek profit in this, wreaths throughout America, which they also believe in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the National Cemetery of Fayetteville, Arkansas, Battery Park, New York City, and at the memorable location of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she had made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Ms Hunt said it was her way to get back what the victim was doing.
It is a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloth cloaks, volunteers walked through the cemetery along the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children were playing and holding hands together as they transported the young pine to the grayish gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arc of bees on top.
Close to Section 60, where most of the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there has been real silence.
The associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some were crying sincerely, others were praying, and families and friends were holding on to each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stones, while others bowed to look at the little black-and-white names, pushed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of her son’s grave.
She traveled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio to visit the last resting place of David Shane Spicer, a Navy Artillery sergeant who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... ..my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. government contractor jailed by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has detained a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, Foreign Ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Section of Interest in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Some charges have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical stats, raise the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Mrs. S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to take over the prizes, but the permission was denied.
The U.S. contractor’s detention may be the result of growing tensions between Castro’s communist brother, who rules Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a “detention tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the New York Times' detention on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States would take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used after texting, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a daily wage.
Internet use on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans who often want to sign up must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Arresting an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in Cuba’s prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
Incarceration and detention were clearly immoral.
Such activities, which in any other open society would be legal - let's say free mobile phones - are a criminal offense in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group program, who recently published an unfavorable report on freedoms in Cuba called "The New Castro, the same Cuba," as a reference to the installation of the country's Fidel Castro restitution.
Vivanco said the defendants were often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that all solutions would be more political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering plots to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday unveiled the alleged leader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruits searching for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a gray rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of the men posted a comment authorizing the terrorist attacks on his YouTube video site.
Saifillah took the lead of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them reach a remote area of Pakistan in the Indigenous Tribes Zone of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported on the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA’s attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, away from the formidable mountains in the northwest that became the refuge of terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
Why they were dropped, said the official, who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested under Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The organization’s recruiters function as guards, eliminating those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. false recruits have been subjected to special scrutiny by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in allowing anyone to join them in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to infiltrate these groups, is there no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been monitored so much?" said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more based on the web.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen to demand climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday demanding stronger climate action from negotiators at the Bella city convention center.
Protesters reported the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police said the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of the minor incident in the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists were passing through the city carrying banners with the English words “This is not Planet B” (i.e., secondary) and one in Spanish proclaiming “The Earth says ‘enough’.”
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the country’s deplorable state, which is being affected by climate change, which continues to occur.
That is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leaders to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do it, you can not still avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bell's centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they were either wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and wearing black suits laid several charges near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, starting with flares, but then there were "several big explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the minds of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s main climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he went on to speak Chinese and said, "Because the scenery is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He monitored whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on the prospects of each.
We can see the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that this is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
Test Data Reveals Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achievement in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news about Columbia County’s public education.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among fourth- and eighth-graders over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures of the National Attestation Center for Teaching Progress are the persistent differences in knowledge gained between African-Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average result of white fourth-grade students in the District of Columbia over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only grown by three points, from 209 to 212.
The knowledge gap actually increased from 53 points to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP was performed in the district, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some district education advocates said in the last week that the results, celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
That would suggest that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrisome, said Jeff Smith, CEO of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equality of education in the district.
“I don’t jump up and down because of two or three points,” said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Frequently criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s style of administration, Mrs. Brown stated that reporting test results means the city’s secondary education is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the benefits, and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we didn’t devote nearly any of the time and energy we needed to devote to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district’s effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
Thus, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading curricula, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at upper-grade primary school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their round-the-clock careers significantly lag behind their peers.
The daily math and math curriculum for sixth grade, emphasizing the games and real-life experiences that came to the district under former director Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the progress NAEP reported last week.
And I just think that we should continue to work and do the best possible interventions for those students who remain below the class level, said Mrs Rhee.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Mrs Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It’s a certain eminent dilemma for Mrs. Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political resonances that are against an important agenda.
But the reproach, of course, belongs to other city directors who are trying to maintain a middle proportion between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of large schools.
We must strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can count on their children to receive excellent public instruction.
Mr. Janey, now director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that an essential element of reducing the gap between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to make schools eligible.
You need to get up to 200 days to push through the changes, said Mr. Janey, who contracted with his teacher association last year for a school year of 185 days, which he considers a “symptom” for seeking a bigger raise next year.
Making Higher Education a Part of a Better Future
The tour bus entered Gettysburg College with a loud breath.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white pillars, brick facades, and emerald green lawns.
Graciela's parents had difficulty graduating from college in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the dormitory.
Now she and other eighth-grade students in the group surveyed Gettysburg, where tuition fees were $38690 a year, their position was rather than intimidated by visitors enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That's it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide invited them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they were told the low ratio of professors to students.
Pennsylvania College was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely captivated by the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem with the high number of Spanish immigrant children born in the U.S. who are expelled from college or who become pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "spiritual generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable results achieved - indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, made it to the United States without graduating from college.
Their success story is important, researchers say, as it underscores their point of departure for a generation that played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have attained higher education say that they had a natural penchant for school and an innate penetrating and striving to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and were looking for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would love to go to college — especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we consider that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at each individual point will not solve this, says Patricia Gandara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American area.
We need to think about providing these preschool children with a catch network in every way they can to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela's tour of the dormitories is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparatory programs that start for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered colleges, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq’s oil ministry agrees with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their poor infrastructure during two auctions on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been struck by Iraq’s oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a shareholding in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
U.S. oil giants’ modest participation in Iraq’s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened the door after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans on the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It will be a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by massive coordinated bomb attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the U.S. military withdrawal, are likely deterring U.S. companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proven to be the third-largest resource reserve, analysts say.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close ties with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
State-owned China National Petroleum Corp. has been bidding on more contracts than any other company, leaving with large stakes in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, said a spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad.
We believe that Chinese society will be comparable to its competitors and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the ministry according to the barrel price, and the ministry is willing to pay to strengthen output above the current level in each field.
A top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile hit the Pakistan-Afghan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
It could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in the province of North Waziristan, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched from an unmanned aircraft of the CIA type operating in the illegal indigenous tribes.
They were listed on a white car that was heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with Pakistan’s Ciciliar Intelligence Agency, which was on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said local militants rushed to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness as saying Somalia was poi death.
Somalia was cited as a high-ranking al-Qaida military operations planner who directed the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in founding around the world, said a senior official who does not want to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from the top leadership of al-Qaeda and based on them planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a well-known person to some Americans, but he didn’t humiliate himself in any way to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the Indigenous Tribes and three other top operational leaders.
The pace of attacks launched by the CIA using unmanned aerial vehicles has dropped since the summer from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to Long War, a website managed by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected were informants, the site said.
The United Nations High Representative in Kabul has resigned.
United Nations chief delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed election of a president in Afghanistan.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for the reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a call for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the construction of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment made must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian workers assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it’s time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
Officials said he was deciding between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenne, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election of masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said the charges against Galgraith -- who was released -- "definitely harmed the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism with regard to international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the U.S. High Representative to coordinate efforts to ease U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the restrictions on his efforts in Afghanistan and said the cumbersome UN hiring regulations undermined its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I had the opportunity to get only one person from May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't continue.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to warring areas in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a question from the soldier about the likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I’ve learned anything from Iraq over the last six years, [that] is the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has signaled that some of these sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said a “package of incentives and restraints” would require “to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons” because “its people will suffer extraordinarily” from sanctions.
According to a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN nuclear safety committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, he indicated he wanted to return to talks on curbing his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium stockpile in exchange for urgently needed reactor fuel to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to be withdrawing from the interim agreements - partly because, the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided on whether to engage with the United States.
Honestly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some of the proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think that this has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seek other elections, including surveillance, which Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "degrading sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called “unfounded and unfounded accusations” against some members of the security committee about Iran’s nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers “for the sake of achieving a long-term solution that is appropriate.”
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki this morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent a delay in U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzaani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they learned that when official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rates and ageing population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples, their response was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to just one child.
We didn’t keep anything for anyone else, says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been put in place, creating two generations of only notoriously chubby and spoiled children, affectionately called “little emperors,” who are threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 years and above is projected to rise turbulently from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater in affluent coastal cities with populations with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportions of an aging population and reduce the number of workers in the future.”
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradually calming
As enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably still the most controversial mandate introduced under the Communist Party.
Couples who violated politics faced huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official offices have promoted policies that have helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned for pursuing policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions with their second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually milder in their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were singles - and in 2007, they eased the dictation of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of the decree detailing how it would be justified to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and slip leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Disturbing Reaction
While officials in one rural city near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign starts, most city districts have not reported changes.
The city district of Huinan with a population of 115000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caol district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjan, 26, said she would like to have two children and they were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a backup network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge the one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in union with her first child at the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were impoverished by the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resource manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: “We were the center of attention of our families and everyone was taking care of us.
We weren’t used to provide care and in fact we didn’t want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, expressed this much more unobtrusively.
For middle-class two-career parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view parents as breaking through the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want this way of living for themselves, he says.
One child puts enormous demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial propstor questions -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have a resume prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher food standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching misguided attitudes and recriminations -- refocused on Friday on releasing a document that proposes ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations carrying most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which can provide a starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminating the way forward.
But we have seen important progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the ad hoc working group of the United Nations, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies so they can limit their carbon output, and what the upper limit of global temperature rise should be that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, a 180-page text of the meeting to focus on what the top climate official at the UN, Yvo de Boer, described as a “big picture”.
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could collectively limit their emissions by a year to 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions during that period to 15 to 30 percent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union on Friday hurriedly discussed a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from flooding and drought to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still cited the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week’s talks.
The U.S. special envoy for climate issues, Todd Stern, rejected a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary contributions from major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had established a tougher line against China, running officials of the Bush administration just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text is not enough to secure the restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of “village sense” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” had led earlier in the week to a message that the United States would not financially help China deal with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the world’s major powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly for the preservation of individual economies rather than for the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that the world’s two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to carry out stronger actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries had become much more aggressive in finding a way to prevent large emitters responsibly in their actions.
It is clearly a game about how the new economic hegemony is developing, said Ulate, who also serves as regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to push for a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said that the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The small island nation alliance, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate talks in favour of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations "has caused a political push on the whole political process" in part because they are now united and demand action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The meeting sparked a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government had to fight for an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister, stepped out of the planes and ran through the halls of the Bell Center to closed-door meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- when 13,000 people moved daily from and to the convention center, guitar-playing activists staged at night ironic spectacle about the countries they thought they had sent, and hand-to-hand rather than e-mail -- controlled by a challenge.
The intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen, and earlier on Wednesday, 60 heads of state.
We are in high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the Deputy Minister for Global Policy on International Nature Conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first train at 140 miles per hour redefines Monday's feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which marked a revolution in transport in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed passenger train will reach speeds of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Pancras, and cover a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and embarked on the first high-speed personal set outside of Lund.
It hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
The neglected standing water should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on business trips, and the transition from aircraft and cars to railways could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were allowed to gain for this vision.
But the tens of trillions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects, and concerns about environmental disruption have now hampered the construction of Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, handed over its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
It provided him with a detailed map of the routes of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to West Midland has been proposed within five metres in urban areas and neighborhoods where reaching the environment could be problematic.
In the open landscape, up to 25 m of the final route was planned.
HS2 also envisages three options for an extensive high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis responds in the spring.
The preferred option is the configuration of the shape of the letter Y, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midland.
The line should be divided near Birmingham by one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One track should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has been made," said the railway expert.
Once this is done, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at speeds of 2,250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already being designed to carry 400 m long trains that would be able to carry 1,100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to capture the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on already existing lines north of Birmingham, and keep driving times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers Pay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Mortgage on Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, the holders of Tory’s front seat bench in the House of Representatives, paid thousands of pounds last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
A party spokesman behind the prison, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived “out of rations,” raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-clad extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to the taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in time, and so it was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legg who was carrying out the inspection of the member expenditures. Last night, Mr Duncan voiced his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in the village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house a winter garden, which is in the plans marked as a "sunflower".
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for fun and treats".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last review by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr Duncan changed the pupillary security to a <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 mortgage from his London estate to a house in his constituency that he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr Duncan was claiming approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month in the interest of the mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest of RBS in the repayment of Mr Duncan's mortgage could not be changed at this time, which suggests that all this was intended to finance a loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage payments fell in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The latest municipal documents show that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Mr Duncan left his job as shadow House chief in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs had to survive the "allowance" scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like a s**t."
He said, "I have spent money on my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his issues in May when it turned out that he was claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the tax office approved that it "could be considered excessive".
One activist dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
When asked about the mortgage increase last night, Mr. Duncan said, “It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the tax office and subsequently by Legge.”
He added: "It's not a question of hiding and clicking or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
It would not be possible for many other ways to be cleaner or simpler.”
Come and take a close look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with the Advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative ecclesiastical group that excites choreography with creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, and to use Christmas collets as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when it allowed visitors to view the last hut from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop's bread and brewed wine, provided free of charge.
Selected carols included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the hut featured the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a television marketing assistant at Hove, is a non-scholarship priest in the Diocese of Chicago and head of Beyoncé.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the advent calendar in the huts was created just as an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place, and we’ve tried to try and present it spiritually.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which is due to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, a demonstration around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the increasing global mobilization, which is clear evidenced by current events, had contributed to the "political tax" of possible failure in Copenhagen being too high.
According to an AFP reporter, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the parade began, when a group of about 300 demonstrators dressed in black began smashing windows with paving stones and hammers.
The police immediately intervened forcefully.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were "cuffed and seated in the streets on Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession proceeded calmly towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A podium was built for speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, a group that wanted to create “blue waves” for a “just climate”.
Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the environmental debt in favor of the south, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: this is the time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
Rivers and watercourses are drying up in Africa, and we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement for a different world has approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the characters of the fight for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to warming climates.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
Several hundred people marched in Manila, mostly students, wearing red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada, several hundred protesters took to the streets demanding strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces it as a “fracking”
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares the move a "fracking".
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 to control South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, attendance was 58% a few hours before the closing of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergei Bagapsha, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which has condemned the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of the territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict that killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through the elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Svetlanov<0xC3><0xA1>, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted that she voted for President Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>.
She was one of those who came to vote in a ballot box at a school in the capital Suchumi, in a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people are huge billboards with Bagapsh next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gaul, in the west of the country, Russian officials who had come to oversee the election were warmly welcomed by district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhazians, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexey Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticised last year’s agreements with Moscow, such as a treaty that allows Russia to control the railway network of Abkhazia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive duel must take place within two weeks.
Climate: manifestations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, a demonstration around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession proceeded calmly towards the Bella Center, where negotiations were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to enter.
A podium was built for speakers, before which a spiritual candlelight meeting was held with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
According to an AFP reporter, there were incidents shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began smashing windows.
The police immediately surrounded them and intervened without waiting, while knocking several demonstrators to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, one police officer on his jaw was injured with a paving stone and four cars were set on fire near a squat near the incidents, which resulted in police sources arresting about 20 people.
We are concentrating on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters were blown up again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue raincoats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of Friends of the Earth, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "just climate".

Oxfam has called on several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first manifestations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to warming climates.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, marched in front of the city hall.
Hundreds of protesters also met in Hong Kong and Jakarta to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the "350" protests, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The subjects geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the final year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and there will be the same general culture program for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because, according to him, the S specialization is no longer focused on exact sciences, but "in essence the best students are in it".
The ES and L specializations cannot be for any sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would not bother to learn geography and history in the last year of professional grammar schools."
Ifop’s poll, published by Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven out of ten (69%) French people disagree with the government’s project to abolish compulsory history and geography teaching in the S-specialty high school, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the cancellation, both left-wing and right-wing.
The minister, on the other hand, added that "it is not considered" to abolish philosophy in the specialization program of the graduation year.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher education reform, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for Tuesday's mobilization against the project, which they said sacrificed the pedagogical education of future grammar school professors.
As part of the Master’s Degree 2 (M2), the Minister explained that at the beginning of the year, they will pass an entrance examination focused on their field and at the end of the year another examination verifying their ability to teach.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of the Master's degree and in the first year they will perform as an intern professor before the students.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will gain more experience with the students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
The project to abolish the school map by 2012 has been confirmed once again.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is the call announced at the council this morning by Jean Jouzel, the vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole Normale Supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As one AFP journalist reported, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute expert contributions to be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, named after the fish from the local pond, which was named by the students.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected and specified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours, but we can also sum up the basic goals in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel, who spoke before fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, only using graphs.
It’s part of our scientific work, he said, with the hope that listeners will learn that “the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations.”
Videos recorded at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February, and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
Prison guard unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday as they demanded that they be reimbursed for bonuses and overtime until the Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed until January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (Second Guards Union) asked non-custodial staff to attend a demonstration on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities to "block" them, thus alerting them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for prison guards (3rd union of the sector) called on them to “convene assemblies in individual prisons and launch a major mobilization” saying it was “shameful and unacceptable” to “overtime and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and holidays” worked in October.
The first union of wardens, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), “calls for a total mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation.”
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellor’s office said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mari sent a message to the prison guards’ unions reassuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, the Minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the prison administration to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation that has arisen from a poor assessment of the number of overtimes will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mariov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of executives who receive famous bonuses for performing their functions and achieving their goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the inter-regional FO union in Marseille indignantly announced its decision to boycott until "all meetings and subpoenas" are called off.
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays unless they are reimbursed for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more work and more tasks without giving us additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, according to the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case the funds are scarce, said the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives ‘Better Gifts’ at Christmas Than He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to Oprah Winfrey, the "goddess" of the screen, that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the program, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion, gets his share.
Jesus also likes Boa, Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the pre-broadcast of the show.
And Michelle Obama also objected to her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts he received: “No, I certainly didn’t, I gave you some great gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Well, of course, he was forced to agree by the president, but immediately afterwards, with humor, he pointed his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave you this?"
On this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who has been ardently supporting Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their most unpopular gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-speed gear wheel, but also a basketball, which his Kenyan father donated to him on Christmas Day, which he only rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father come to see us for Christmas and giving me that basketball, the president told me.
It wasn't until a long time later that I realized that he actually gave me the ball.
The first lady remembered the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday Operated Again, RTL Says He's In Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles due to "injuries" caused by a larger operation he underwent in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his closest friends, while RTL said the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was operated again on Wednesday-Thursday night at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted a "wound resulting from the operation" of the hollow plate he had suffered in Paris on November 26, his press office said in Paris, adding that the lesions required "corrective surgery".
However, the singer's press department tried to calm the public and said the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical communiqué would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we'll be a little more confident, RTL adds.
The press office, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that, according to "some sources", there was no drainage after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to a ruptured plate.
The surgery, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephane Delajoux, a doctor well known in artistic circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
Following the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the operation.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday's, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "wrong time" but added that he "didn't worry about the rocker" because he was a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing something stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, producer Jean-Claude Camus reassured the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted well to antibiotics" and that the infection had been "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laetitia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then for a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every one of his health problems has been greatly monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro 2009/small pool: Bousquet premieres in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time World Championships medalist in a large swimming pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championships in a small swimming pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the championship, where overalls were last allowed, only three world records were broken, although much more was expected.
One of them overcame the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztov<0xC3><0xA1> in the 200 m positional race and two remaining men's relay of Russia in the 4x50 m positional race.
Big sadness for Bousquet, who broke the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, which premiered ten swimmers instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croat Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he had predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore overalls made of polyurethane, which will be banned from January 1.
Overalls have helped from February 2008 to 238 world records and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the overalls this time also did not help the German Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record that holds the 400 meters freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I couldn’t beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola's Romanesque sarcophagus sold for $1.5 million
The Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to no one other than French writer Emile Zola, was sold for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than estimated, the art dealer Sotheby’s said.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-tall front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, perhaps four or five," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still underway, but it’s the subject that’s probably the most prized, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The album was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family, and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bath in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, the Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before the coming to power of Marshal Petain.
There it remained shaded for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found during a search of the Louvre museum database that the plaque was part of the "remnants of Emil Zola" opened from 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted attempt by President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of a safe exit were not met.
“After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to make this transfer possible,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
A Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back, a source at the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The coup government wanted to force President Zelaya to “demise” and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as an exiled head of state.
The coup government “has experienced another setback when it wanted me to give up my post (...), they wanted me to resign,” Zelaya told Globo Radio on Thursday, in which he often speaks out about the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, the deposed president added, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told the Honduran radio station HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had come to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army had stepped up protection.
Brazil's Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticised the coup government's stance.
They show their marginal position towards international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who converged with socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned unexpectedly from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and took refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of there, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of “high treason” he is accused of, according to the government.
On November 29, President Roberto Micheletti managed to organize presidential elections to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance encourages optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Thursday with a surge in U.S. trade balances in both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on “a half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on U.S. trade balance numbers, “which show activity improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A big innovation is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, which is a reflection of the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell from the research company Economy.com.
However, in the United States, unemployment rose against all expectations last week and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen “to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also fallen.
Treasury yields with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.482% compared to 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and 30-year yields rose to 4.492% compared to 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime chanted "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime slammed the wives of political prisoners in Havana on Thursday for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration, at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dame in White", wives or close political prisoners were squealed directly on the street by supporters of the regime of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Gone with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the regime's dissidents chanted with a raised fist.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilian personnel who came "to ensure security".
The day before, there had been a similar demonstration in Havana against the "Ladies in White", but there had been no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana's Vedado district, police detained about ten dissidents who were also about to demonstrate on Thursday for World Human Rights Day, a journalist told AFP.
According to the journalist, the police loaded dissidents who were whipped by government regime supporters into civilian vehicles using force.
Arresting dissidents under similar conditions only takes a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 European Parliament Sakharov Prize, "Ladies in White," organized an unauthorized march to "release all, according to the dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" paid for by their archenemy, the United States.
A finished miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration by supporters of the government regime against the "opponents of the revolution".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman killed an 80-year-old man with a knife and injured five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A madman armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak times on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old man, born in 1929, died according to the Alliance Police Syndicate in a hospital from the consequences of his injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker then attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
The husband, about 30 years old, began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second victim is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs may have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on the boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two more people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old man and a forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives carried by a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several bystanders, including young people, have tried, according to testimonies gathered by the AFP, to stop the madman and disarm him.
I saw a 30-year-old man in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, commented on the situation.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one of the city policemen, who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, tried to apprehend an armed man and were wounded with fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe place, and I noticed a big wound on his stomach, Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about 30-year-old man came, who also had knife wounds.
A man who did not have IDs was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre referred the case to the investigation department of the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting to be questioned.
A police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his mind" as "all the lunatics of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold".
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for criminal prosecution to end
Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski’s lawyer asked again Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop the prosecution of his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, the attorney for the director of the film "The Pianist", criticized in front of three judges of the Court of Appeals of the Second District of California the serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the events of 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, said lawyer Hummel, adding that the behavior of the judge who was ruling the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "had a chill in his back."
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) allegedly had to negotiate with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and wanted" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually declared at the end of September that he had "lie" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a court hearing in which he will be able to present evidence of his claims.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said at the first State hearing, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski had appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles prosecutor Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial".
In this case, we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also the other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
He believes that the director "is asking for a favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to take a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Lawyer Hummel was not alone in asking for Roman Polanski's prosecution to stop.
The victim's legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also reiterated her request for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: “No one in this room can say that the process was fair.”
“Thirty-two years, that’s enough.”
Roman Polanski Arrested in Switzerland on September 26
After more than two months behind bars, he was released into house arrest at his Gstaad cottage, where he is awaiting possible exile.
Wall Street Ends Pointless, Stopped by Rising Dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without a direction, the market fluctuates between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the data from the final close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blitzsilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased very much and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "helped to improve the market mood in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," summarized analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned and rose sharply to 73.4 in December, up from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new rise in the dollar’s price against the euro, which is the highest in two months, “pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Tech stocks are losing ground under their feet.
The stock market has fallen.
The revenue of the state treasure with a view of 10 years increased to 3,540% compared to 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a view of 30 years increased to 4,497% compared to 4,492% a day earlier.
The choice of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a month-long trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the finish line on Saturday to achieve their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great beauty celebration took place for the second year around Johannesburg and so far five candidates have won the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariata Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were chosen Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
I’ve seen a lot of things and I’ve had so many experiences!, confided Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. world time).
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful country where I would wear a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy that I was able to experience it twice, Ksenia Sukhina, the Miss World, confided in me in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in South Africa was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking landscape".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss is now concentrating on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the winner of 1994, who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The performance will be presented by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands.
Unusual for the president, said Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I never dreamed of.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, says Alice Taticchi, enthusiastically Miss Italy.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive," as his son David assured us on Friday's arrival at Los Angeles Airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday said as he stepped out of the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. world time).
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would arrive "as soon as possible" at the Los Angeles-based Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection resulting from a sprained intervertebral disc surgery he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, the singer was "put into artificial sleep" at night in Los Angeles for the sake of comfort, which is supposed to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put into artificial sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was due to an infection after an operation of the protruding intervertebral disc, which took place on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated on again at night from Wednesday to Thursday.
According to an AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance of a French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, said he was leaving for Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris on November 26.
They told us it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, M. Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too quickly to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke with the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this path is not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered twice from a prolapse of the intervertebral disc, he added.
Earlier on RTL radio, he said the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on the actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, which he was working on at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical chamber, described him as a "man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the medical chamber, and who cannot even be "recommended from afar".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the procedure was "very good" and post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary,” he added.
The singer’s health problems have been growing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
It is clear that the date of the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (In Amiens, note red.) seems too close, said Camus.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue to use their acronym.
On Friday, the UDF, controlled by the MoDem Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou party, reacted to an attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to appropriate the acronym of the former Giscard party, saying that the acronym should not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate the UDF's abbreviation, saying that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou did not deserve to carry her inheritance after handing over his hand to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This step was supported by Hervé de Charette (formerly NC-UMP), who ascribes the UDF brand to him because he was the first to register it with the Institut national de la propriété industrielle (Institut national de la industriale) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the committee of the Association of UDF, run by friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of its silence and submitted a formal request to the minister and the MP to stop using the abbreviation and to hand back the trademark ownership, under the threat of prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised concerns about proposing to your political movement +retake+ the UDF abbreviation, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 committee members, including, for example, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez of the MoDem or Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance Centri.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to include the name + Nouveau centre+ on your promotional materials and on the website of your movement, with the slogan + UDF of today+, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the UDF committee explains, which asks the NC movement to immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials, including (its) websites.
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the trademark ownership to the legitimate owners".
If you do not do so, we will contact the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members are respected.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007, "to create a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
The Nouveau Centre therefore has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
The last UDF Congress voted in 2007 to join the MoD for three years and to form a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, “when he registered the trademark,” he was “not a member of the UDF for three years,” but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used a non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This inaction begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC’s strategy: “It seems to us, both in politics and in everyday life, that it is more valuable to create a name for itself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name to which we have no right.”
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday decided to sue artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier and decide whether he used the state of weakness of an 80-year-old billionaire to deprive her of part of her fortune, which her daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames on him.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010, for abuse of a state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000 is imposed.
This decision confirms that a trial will actually take place in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the management of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
L’Oréal’s heiress and principal shareholder has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010, and at the same time provide an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness, and in what period.
I think he'll pass.
I'll talk to her about it, said Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As regards lawyer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news(...). Expertise will show that this old lady, who needs protection, was manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter opened criminal proceedings against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and omni-artist she accuses of taking advantage of her mother’s weakness for years to get a gift of a billion euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the merits of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers' lawsuit, Friday's lawyers' trial speech has at times turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, in which she expressed her distrust towards her husband Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oisa Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt adds, "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Ever since she got married, I have never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office has again found the complainant’s conduct to be unwarranted, all the more so since the guardian judge in those days rejected her request to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection to her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in the court, is not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her," said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
Finally, the Court decided that Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers’s justification would be expressed at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.
The Managerial Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence was useless...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the attitude of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying employees with "values" determined from the mountain, as it was before, when it was necessary to impose on the consumer products that came from the ideas of the heads of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of the business, the marketing revolution has compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...even though authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences are regularly returning!
Passive attitudes of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly management cadres.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to anticipate" and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a managerial revolution, which should aim to put employees at the center of the company’s interest as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal opinion polls – like the questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done after different turns!
Furthermore, authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one’s own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are college graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of thought convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, currently revived by "neurosciences" from the United States and widely spread without much knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the possibility of moving the "hebels" (sic) of the involvement of managers, a recent survey by the Ipsos agency showed on Figaro.fr, which only confirms the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a fundamental insight into all management plans and practices: Commitments to the company will only be possible for employees if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is only dealt with by studies of motivational functional analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which allows them, through an image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, anticipate and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on the right track”.
This creates a breeding ground for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo, Obama’s “just war” has earned praise from the right.
The U.S. right on Friday welcomed a speech Barack Obama had delivered the day before in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner was defending the concept of a “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who first ridiculed Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a right-wing Republican wing muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed herself on the subject of “sometimes necessary” wars in her memoirs that were just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would want to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “a very good job” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who praised above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I thought this speech was quite historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was delighted to see a “leftist president” remind members of the Nobel Prize committee that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he introduce himself as a “world citizen” as he always did, but he “spoke like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they didn’t create themselves, and that they don’t do too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few right-wing dissatisfactionists are Bush-era hawk former UN ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech “uniform, swollen and uninspiring,” according to the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Rep. Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
“If we wrap the war in a package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press has a commendable position on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the awarding of the peace prize to Obama prematurely, it rated his output as "overperformance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
"The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international solutions to conflict, poverty and oppression," the daily said.
Obama “spoke as needed,” the New York Times said, describing the speech as “simple and instructive.”
Road carriers: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, road transport unions and the TLF, the only employer organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
State Secretary for Transport Dominique Bussereau said he was "pleased" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, following several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators parted early on Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
This is despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6 p.m. to sign the agreement.
The conflict "would hurt businesses very much" and "would be in danger of disrupting the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest salaries (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries is increased from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we will give orders to our members to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit a high-wage increase due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest wages and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also foresees a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow for a focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in corporate taxes" that was the subject of the government's amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consistent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to the enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the whole industry, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "in the shortest possible time", Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be hindered by the disapproval of employers' organizations.
The FNTR speaks of “bad trade” as <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “has already been offered to the sector as part of a carbon tax offset.”
The State Secretary for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters during the upcoming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
Otre said the deal "would bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" over the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: traffic interruptions at the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The suspension of transport on the RER A commuter train line, the largest public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend as Friday’s negotiations between trade unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the question of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) will run every second train, except for this section only one train out of four.
The connection to the SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure a connection with large department stores".
The RER A line runs from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by the RATP runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was in operation at the peak, and practically no train was driving at times outside the peak, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of the Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning, there were far fewer people at the station than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines), among other things, because there were no pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up “an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.”
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, the SNCF said, as more officers and security guards were predicted.
The RER A commuter trains operated by the SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
The next general assembly of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, where the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership will be evaluated, which the unions have rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes to negotiate a special protocol for RER A commuter trains on all sides, working time arrangements, career paths, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdborySouth).
The RATP even postponed proposals for the premium for the time being, which made the CGT worse by the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while it was possible for the travel carriers and the SNCF".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be reviewed more closely," RATP said.
Which is why unionists think the company is "making fun of weekend travelers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calm down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent announce a strike emergency.
Trade unions are asking for a premium ranging from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and they are hampering the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports a million passengers a day.
Drivers of RER commuter trains earn between 2,200 and 2,700 euros in gross wages and between 600 and 650 euros in premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish justice system has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to dismantle the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protests in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and thus try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes were needed to dissolve the party, Kili<0xC3><0xA7> said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysely Tuglukov<0xC3><0xA1>, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
At the same time, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tuglukov<0xC3><0xA1> and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP party has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party's leadership warned ahead of the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no "essential link" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a range of measures to strengthen their rights, seeking to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police have broken up in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the ruling, thousands of demonstrators have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear gas grenades and water cannons, and demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or shot rocks from slingshots.
About a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict was handed down, Mr Türk said the justice decision would only "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are, on principle, against interference.
It does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A nice crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the FES winter technical services department.
But so that his employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will go to 20 so-called A-scatter sections, explains Brauburger.
These sections include the main and passways such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and downhill sections like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle with wet salt, which holds better, some 1040 kilometers within a maximum of three hours.
Therefore, FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the roads are free when the traffic starts to work".
It's hard when it doesn't snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter department of technical services, "because no one is willing to make room for the spillers."
Only when it doesn’t snow so much are the access and interconnection roads, which include the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they're going to complain.
At five o'clock in the morning, FES infantrymen set off on the road, priority is given to cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually can’t take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt, there is a special service that monitors bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the ice sheet forms quickly, the ice breaks out as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
The police will also call them if necessary.
The cradle of dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran on two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have been extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of the journal Science write that Tawa hallae, however, was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship relationships, expansions and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unprecedented for triassic deposits, according to team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The finding confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of dinosaurs from the Triassic are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into the three most important developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyrannosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and herbivores, ornithipts.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air bags that even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more effective than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since a related line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, he created this useful innovation, probably a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Since the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have deduced that lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development soon split and spread from South America to all the continents, which at that time, as a supercontinent of Pangea, formed a single earth mass.
The fact that the team and Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related, theropods would also speak for it.
The three cannot come from a single common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His hypothesis could put together a distorted picture, because in South America very many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, with other continents seldom found.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare by-line of the reptile genus to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread across the world and many new species developed, while relatives died out and the Triassic and Jurassic interfaces.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, which dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of a meteorite helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the Triassic and has lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has caused a worldwide upheaval.
278 professors and lecturers at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the instigated police intervention by the presidium.
Because the walls and artwork were paved, university president Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied last week by striking students and lecturers cleared.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories say, does not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching by students and teachers by the police command."
The expulsion represents an “unacceptable interference” with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “unjustify and criminalize the protest” and distracts attention from the content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
Speakers call for an end to criminal prosecutions.
It is claimed that the majority of strikers did not support material damage.
Justified protest
Also, the youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessian Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has defended the university’s president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said Thursday in the Current Hour in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have understanding for the protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the CDU's National Assembly.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Linke saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as an excuse to criminalise the protest, Janine Wissler (Linke) said.
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a clean-up.
Linke submitted a proposal urging the interior minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union, was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, the district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol of close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Zelenograd Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, and signed for Frankfurt by Chief Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will travel to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to engage in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large concern Sitronics and Russia Electronics.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are planted.
The Stuttgart Brake
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For supporters of the project, it is quite simply a "new heart of Europe".
S21 is more than the launch of a train station, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
The main stations with railways, which ended in the city center, were then considered to be transport-technical fossils of the 19th century, which act as the brakes of modern railway transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to overwhelm the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Take a ride, stop for a while, keep going - that's how it should work.
And that is why the main railway stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the trans-European railway line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that the start of construction in the Hessian and Bavarian cities was almost unfinanced.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and control vehicles at both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with getting in and out.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
It was promoted by land and municipal politicians.
The railways cooperate, even because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
Urbanly, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created that - if we trust the computer images of designers - will contain a lot of green.
For the rail transport system, the S21 is harmful.
The transit station and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy, however, must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to steep climbs.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion was to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts believe that 10 to 15 billion are real.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
There are sixty major projects on the Ministry of Transport’s list.
One of the most important is the construction of a approximately 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been being built at a slow pace.
There would be a lot of pressure here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The Rhine Valley route will become the bottleneck of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport.
The country's government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag if it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban and allow it to be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the night flight ban if the planned northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport was to be built.
Permissions for 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., according to the federal government, do not comply with the law to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it wants to revise the ruling.
The opposition criticised the postponement and appealed to government representatives to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights before being elected.
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's rebuke, the country's government is trying to get to its night flights by "twisting the law and tricks".
Exact legal control needs time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction’s comments on the ban on night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
U.S. Banks Repay Aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid back a total of $45 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the bank’s rescue fund Tarp.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup also plans to repay state aid.
The constitutions want to get rid of the restrictions imposed by accepting money – limiting bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net cash from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: “The money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The financial institution damaged itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state also by obtaining money in the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, said the U.S. bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off their aid.
Quick Choices
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors ousted editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night, the council wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was named the favorite.
However, the station did not confirm this - officially, so as not to precede the trial.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF Intendant Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the closure of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter’s board of directors failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven against him, and Schächter's loss of office was a bitter defeat, although one could expect it.
The EU's majority in the board signaled several weeks before the election that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief on the argument that ZDF news coverage quotas had fallen under Brender.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
The last time even 35 state-law lawyers intervened in the debate, which assessed Koch’s actions as unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington, D.C.; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the ZDF's main studio.
After Brender, who was elected journalist of the year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch's anti-candidate in the board, the Rhine-Palmian prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant's personnel proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the expulsion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's intended successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a smart chess move - immediately after Brender's removal, he strongly criticized the panel for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing his face, so he could be elected to the board of directors without suspecting that the party had been pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is already classified as a leftist liberal.
Study gets rid of the harpoons
Partial success for students: After a year of strikes, culture ministers finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: In principle, each study module should be completed with one test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a "real and defendable rate" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities in Germany and abroad.
The federal states undertake to create more flexible common structural assignments for bachelor’s and master’s degree courses.
Earthly deviations should cease to exist.
Fewer Exams
Since the start of student protests in the wormhole, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths about better study.
For the first time, they are filled with content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided that the number of exams will be drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed with only one exam", according to a 30-page report, which is to partially re-regulate the approval of study fields.
“A significantly lower test load,” said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Board, “is to stop the erroneous development that has significantly reduced the study effort.”
To do this, the "demand of study" in the future will be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content “must be hard-checked” to “do not unnecessarily restrict students’ choices”
seminars.”
Students should have “a claim to a space that enables and supports their own initiative.”
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, but also for existing fields of study after review.
These need to be “re-accredited” every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 to re-check all study fields.
There are ten accreditation agencies across Germany, which are subject to accreditation boards set up by the federal states.
In October, the culture ministers urged the federal states to “emphasize” the agencies so that the curriculum is not too crowded and the test regime is not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate has pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The money should primarily be used by universities to pay for consultancy programmes and study advice, and to strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the university law to the parliament.
According to her, only one exam should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of studies should be even more flexible, to this end, the recognition of examinations from other universities should be guaranteed and the accessibility of the master's degree should be facilitated.
By the end of next year, the complexity of all study fields in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued about the country's study conditions.
In addition to the praise, there was criticism of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups of Juso has called for the formation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word" should also be spoken by the students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of University Rectors (HRK), Margrethe Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture, with whom HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would give any graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a postgraduate master’s degree.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that there are enough places available for today’s generation of undergraduate students in the master’s fields with the best possible study conditions, said Andreas Keller, a member of GEW’s board of directors.
The federal states must employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to the Master’s programmes.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting to and from Germany is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, which in this torn-out language piece themes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Forum of Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of the significant non-literary upheaval last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, at which it was about “German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security records”.
The apparently insecure and contaminated Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to collaborating with fellow writers from Romanian Germans, including Richard Wagner, William Totoek, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
Attempts to recruit began inconspicuously, initially in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "someone who has not resisted enough attempts to intimidate the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and shame of the political system, which is based on control and spike.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
Secret agent Walter played a role in the Securitate, Michael Markel said after Söllner's confession, referring to the positive influence of secret agent Walter on himself.
"He cut me out" at all the important points for him, Markel says.
It is his moral duty to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement in this form and before this audience was an unexpected, but absolutely surprising, confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta Müller wrote as early as July, when she was reading her own files, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the spies of the Securitate.
Afflictions, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases probably know what name is hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Other than in the domestic, already very certain review of Stazi files, the manipulation of the Securitate control remains is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic awareness-raising has been thwarted and curtailed.
One of the Birthler offices, which is responsible for the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issuance of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005, there has been a law governing the management of components.
The fact that former members of the Securitate still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, proved one interview in which one of the former chiefs of the Securitate from Timisoara expressed a negative opinion about the winner of the award.
She is said to have psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The abuse of power was expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, as in the case of Söllner, as in the context of the silenced offence, there are inevitable questions.
The peculiar reaction of the audience to Söllner’s confession leaves it to be expected that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the attribution of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It was as if a cleanly dressed sales representative had come from a cute Christmas party at which a manufacturer of sports goods gave out candy when a quarter of an hour after midnight the new VfBr coach Christian Gross, accompanied by the sponsor’s orange-colored bag, entered the Mercedes-Benz C-Class.
A man with a striking dancer let himself ride on him in a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old man was drunk with luck too little.
It was a pleasant evening, but work will continue tomorrow.
Or it's just getting started.
In the words of the Swiss: "Even though we have reached the eight-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be dazzled by success: it will be a brutally tough fight against the descent."
"A far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat in Mainz the performance from the royal class even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid re-obvious weaknesses after three quick goals Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11.).
Lottery
The Champions League 8 finals (matches 16/17. + 23/24 February/ rematch 9/10. + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
Thus, the joy of Babbel’s quivering succession will be preserved.
Not only with the supposed healer, who gave the uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy of the game in a short time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and encouraged them to be more courageous, explained Soul Healer Gross, a simple-sounding successful recipe that, under Babbel's therapist, proved no longer effective.
Jens Lehmann, Babbel’s admirer, said: “When there is a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you would not consider possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after a weeks-long break caused by an injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomen" found by the proverbial "fresh wind" and the work practices of the new boss: "He is a man who is radical and requires discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously lacking for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart not yet rescued, sports chairman Horst Heldt warns
But the VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after a 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt reminded that although one goal was achieved in the season, the other one is still far away.
We're not over the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match began.
There are decisions that are made by others, not Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He gave the board a weak lead and decided to change the coach after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even the fact that his day off after the games was canceled, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeeper.
Both 40-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of a deposed coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a big share of the success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man agrees with the plastic bag.
Wrestling World Heavyweight Championship
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title for WBC.
The arbitrators' opinion was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern unanimously to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't get the K.O. everyone was expecting.
Klitschko improved his score to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice he was defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th game.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bern arena, Klitschko was driving a 2.02-meter-high duel with his left hand.
The eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, retreated before the World Champion's strikes, so Klitschko could not strike a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand.
In total, passive Johnson did little to challenge the challengers and only tried to get to the next rounds.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka provoked with words and gestures, but his blows hit the world champion rarely.
But it is still only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought Klitschko full twelve laps.
The challenger took care of the excitement in the Swiss capital before the duel.
He insulted Klitschko as a "disgusting zombie" who "didn't do anything right."
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion was provoked, pulling his sunglasses from Johnson's nose, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klick's return
Klicko remained undefeated after his fourth appearance on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one shot and I was physically in good shape, Klitschko explained a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, is to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r is the World Champion of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA belt is worn by British David Haye, after he dethroned Nikolai Vulayev, 2.13 meters high, in November.
Haye canceled the summer fight against Klitschko, which was scheduled for September.
Apparently, his promotional company is planning a fight against Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
The case of Kunduz
Opposition front-line attack: Jürgen Trittin, head of the Greens, denounced Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar because of bad information about the Kunduz affair.
SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the chancellor to explain.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister told a "knowingly untruth" about the deadly bombing of the two tanks in September, Jürgen Trittin, head of the Greens, told ARD's "Tagesschau" news programme on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual expression: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack involved not only the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
In the US airstrike demanded by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, according to NATO investigations, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Federal Assembly's Afghan policy - and whether the Office of the Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens counterpart Renate Künast have called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the ministry’s statement about the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were correctly informed about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially it was said that they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and to cover up sensitive details to the minister.
But around the two top officials, it was reported that they had even alerted the Defense Ministry to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and one report by the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reports that Wichert was in the meantime to ask for clarification in a letter.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the reproaches on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the investigation committee of the Bundestag, which will be established next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others do not see and hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drug addicts who cross the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we can surround ourselves with the wildest fantasies and fantasy delusions.
But he who experiences dream states in vigilance, sees and hears things that others do not see and hear, in today’s Western world he is usually considered a fool or a drug addict, or at least a freak.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug intoxication.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings, or write novels will make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality merge.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and the effect may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be deduced from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of neuronal transmitters of the brain - mainly dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is deflected and interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has employed philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristoteles understood hallucinations as a form of dreaming in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, stated in 1861 "the great similarity of delusions to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
In the fall of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and shrill-colored.
Gravity has no power over it, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against the wall, feel pain all over his body.
Loud, evil voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that revile and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, ties them into a loop, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets up on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Teach yourself, chorus voices shouting, tearing his eardrums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was triggered.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disabled can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an awakened state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens the door to a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the General Psychiatry Clinic of the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
Schizophrenic is located in the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively form them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible with them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
Unlike in a dream, says Fuchss, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved."
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place within a real framework.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why our brains are doing this.
“Extraordinary conditions can cause everyone to lose their relationship with reality in the short term,” says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into a psychopath.
There seems to be a genetic disposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the affected person has minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development there will be damage to the neural maturation of the brain, for example, viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system will break down, which has not manifested itself in any way for many years.
The influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brains shut down
It’s crazy that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his results in the book "Die irreal Welt in unserm Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Head).
Hallucinations are a typical accompanying phenomenon of psychosis, but also surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person also hallucinates under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or under-repressed; when our brains become clogged, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
In fact, a completely normal girl.
If it weren't for the shapes and the voices.
At breaks, she may be approached by a cologne with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's a tense dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the sights are rather depressing.
Frequently, delusions are a burden.
When she sits in a classroom, she cannot watch the lessons many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, while he explains to everyone else audiblely and visibly on the table of mathematical equations.
At night, the apparitions are rather depressing.
When she waits in her dark room to sleep, which comes in seldom and too late, she cannot often tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs appear in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone crazy.
Delusions are also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or is stripped of their stimulus, they are likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn’t have enough jobs and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that a man she had called her father since she had thought was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real perceptions and sounds, it’s hard for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that let the brain form, which is why it seems so real.”
Also, the night dreams evaluate Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The borderline state between dreaming and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world that is too concentrated, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the Psychiatry and Psychotherapy Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positives, creativity - a delusion is also an art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a peculiar form of altered consciousness toward sleep.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed, fictitious dreams that the affected person considers to be real and cannot even retroactively distinguish them from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, for example, by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of borderline state between dreaming and hallucination.
Because it is impossible to manage a situation in reality, there will be a change in the worlds, but the real situation will become present in the imagination.
An intense form of sensory support and sensory transfer in some unbearable situation that allows people to have their own ability to form in an instant into a loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (The Exchange of Hearts) as a saving action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness set out on a multi-day journey, with his body lying motionless in an intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited strange times and places: he becomes an old man tied to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotics from blood.
A Greek kidnaps him on a motorcycle to his homeland, surfing the Firna in the Alps on a hospital bed, and encounters a Korean mobster.
It is completely immersed in imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths for Claussen are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of these mental paths are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile even in the waking state our inner images of external reality are.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At the age of 27, children are expected to take over the publishing house.
The new head of Kallen is a transitional solution: Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children in the long term, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding will still belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the business, says the 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We handled the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only later.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees at the head of their children if they are not sufficiently capable.
It would kill both the kids and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would step down from the chairmanship of the board in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burdy since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Cashier section, responsibility for the company’s assets was added, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s resignation, Direct Marketing, Cizina, Press and Finance were also added.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17, his son Felix, who would have been 42 today, died a few years ago.
Callen’s appointment also serves to “bring over 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding should still belong to 100% of the family in the future, Burda says.
Referring to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty of extinction: “It has always affected companies that have become infected by the desire for capital, which they have speculated and thought they could become great players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had "dreams of world power," Burda says.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don’t want to play the world league with Time, these deals are too big.

Escotes variados
Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is appropriate to find out what celebrities wear and adapt your festive wardrobe to it.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which must be noted.
Here are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa a Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the ‘LIVE Office’.
It is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the Catalan capital.
The LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) office sets out and will manage a travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will arrange mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 'Electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the roll-out of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The purpose is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa’s participation in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects, e.g. G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'calm period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that Spain's auto industry, the country's main export sector, is facing a "peaceful period".
In the Prime Minister’s 2009 economic report, Zapatero summarised the measures introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without a Competitive Plan for the Automotive Industry, we would be in a state of abandonment today, closing down some of our main manufacturing facilities,” he said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is foreseen for this industry in the future, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which is part of the Automotive Industry Integral Plan (PIA), has allocated 800 million for projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government’s measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and car brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions for new vehicles sold in the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely in November by "40%".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will be opened in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of engines.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renewal; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, a specialized company of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior eligibility tests
In addition, the commercial activities of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports performances, tests of eligibility, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests for classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out in a customised circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on the sporty style.
That’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also christened as the “Stop-”, a device currently only available with a 2.0-150 hp petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All of these aspects are excellent with Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely gentle.
Using a toolkit and a console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese tendency to develop a futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that the Honda Civic also presents.
Thus, we can say that both Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product is more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
So far, the automatic engine stop and start system is only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real delicacy. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most popular Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive as many kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention the lane tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, traction control and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth with 17 rounds and bluetooth.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped with a Premium Pack, for an additional fee of 1,500 euros: adaptable two-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more than one kilometre per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only with a petrol engine 2.0 and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21,770 for the Luxury version and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxurious 'Premier'
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever in the brand's new elegant and sexy 'Nine' models. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose a dark 'lady'.
FonPeek Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is used only for viewing mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine ranked him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing him outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was unveiled yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of the invention and its third transformation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but it brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or looking impatiently for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming for a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them, as well as very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device such as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon when it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators begin to think differently and consider different offers that would compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, it offers book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and payable upon purchase, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect one day to happen in the case of FonPeek, it’s an option to purchase with a permanent approach like that Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm checking the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it is the best type from the point of view of the consumer.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on a computer.
The Color That Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama's inauguration as President of the United States, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she also chose when accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects - in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat made of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes both models very different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, now similar model, but in gold color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this timeshaved, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among women of younger age who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'The fertility and career of Spanish women', carried out by CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of a partnership, there are many differences in opinions about the number of children, depending on whether they work or not, and also on the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier, and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer offspring.
"Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years since the start of cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving stable employment and therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of occupation also has a strong impact on motherhood, although it has less impact on the time of starting a cohabitation with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a child is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
“There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
“Women with primary education get married and give birth to their first child before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education go the other way, preferring to get a stable job before getting married and having their first child,” Delgado said.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of performers: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan "Because I am worth it".
'Joyeux Noël', one of the most elegant actresses of international level, joins other celebrities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before she joined the club, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('The Millionaire from the Cabin').
The men’s part of this brand of cosmetics is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey (‘Grey’s Anatomy’) and Matthew Fox (Evangelina’s partner in ‘Lost’).
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most important representatives - designers and models, past and present - gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Best Model of the Year.
Poker Manuel Vicenta
Manuel Vicente donates 30 x-rays of the writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life) in Esov<0xC3><0xBD> pok<0xC3><0xA1>r (Alfaguara, illustration by Fernando Vicente).
He does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vicent spares no relief or inspiration.
This book is a great read, even when read repeatedly.
Here are some observations.
On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of a counter-destiny, a morality without guilt and innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not his intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were a knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man has been surrounded by passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and remorse, which is the spiritual privilege of reaching heaven by way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir to a landlord from the county, and that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a great dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the bewildered cry of this man from Munich to carry his echo into the night of the 20th century in his literary form, fleeing from himself and calling for the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day you knelt down and prayed, 'My God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'"
About Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After the effort comes the dream,/ after the storm a quiet harbor,/ after the war rest,/ after a full life death.'"
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depressions in his luggage.
Her husband completely agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the Azalees or that the birds were singing in Greek.
“No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.”
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos want to do than target Joyce at Baroja?
What else did Bennet do but have Baroja executed with Faulkner's weapon?
What else did it take for Cel to become famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 went through the perimeter and our dog, a crossbred rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was kicked twice without a word and seriously injured.
Our indignation is all the greater because we do not see anything funny in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which was also on the leash.
And besides, the old lady's shock after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than himself.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have lodged a complaint with the nearest commission, but we doubt that it was useful, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The indignation prompted us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they have fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We do not understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of helmets
Tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Transport Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as the two entities reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only way to prevent head injuries and possibly deaths in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products,” and has confirmed that it is working to achieve this goal through an instructional and informational campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a helmet while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first stage in which more than 500 repairs of motorcycles will be placed with signposts in order to make it known to the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety is a “permanent problem” for the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, moreover, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures from the patronage organization of Anfac manufacturers and Ganvam retailers.
However, it is better to quarantine the favorable figure, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase over the past month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
As of January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chasings.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, even if they were bought by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and even in 100% of cases it is financing through third parties.
Other factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation, should be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is also necessary to mentionpersons who do business on the trade list of small and medium-sized companies that intend to buy a light utility vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganwam again reminded that special attention should be paid to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Retailers expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system for the handbrake is already mandatory.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will be with ESP stability control, auxiliary handbrake systems, all this will become a mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, they are already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while others have a deadline for eliminating the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase pedestrian protection, working in such a way that it can help to avoid many collisions.
The handbrake assist system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects when the driver steps down.
But it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers in an accident did not step the brake before the collision, and half of them did not make full use of the brake power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study carried out in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related deaths could be prevented per year.
Reducing this number will be even more significant—according to calculations, one in four accidents with an impact on persons would be prevented—after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (via radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him to increase the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if a collision cannot be prevented, the device will hit the brakes as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors has postponed plans for Opel until January.
Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza), that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on April 8 - as reported by Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warns that it will take more time to fulfill the recovery plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is working to ensure that every point in the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, may be issued late in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be taken within these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM enables contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab's assets to the Chinese company Baic.
Saab will be closed at the end of the year if the sale fails.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as a base and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
On the basis of, first of all, the automatic retractable roof is in a canvas version with manual control, thus reducing the weight by 21 kg; aluminum doors such as GT3 were also used, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the reduction of the weight by another 12 kg; after
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means an additional six kilograms less, and replacing door handles with textile handles means an additional kilogram.
It is also available with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a manual six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountain stretches with many twists.
His behavior can only be classified as inviolable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle will not be pressed to the asphalt.
Quite the contrary: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would at the same time convey such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete capable of warming up his muscles in a short drive for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and re-use the engine...
Whatever we want, with a steering wheel that's as communicative as it is precise, whatever we put our hands on the steering wheel is what the car does.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S), is very successful and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
Curtains are solid, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of roads that we pass with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car coped well with the hollows.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel at dawn even in the advanced morning.
Definitely, this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70.831.
'Bag Girl'
Karl Lagerfeld's girlfriend, Coco Cocoon's icon and occasional 'starlette' at the 'company' shows, the singer shows her face to an evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basconia wins in Israel
She won a brilliant victory in 82-91 in her hosting on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the team of Dusko Ivanovica, and thus became the leader of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was declared the best in the team (29 ratings).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Mico with a large dose of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started with a front for the blues, who stood on the mark from the beginning.
That the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance had already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli squad very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawa team opted for Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with clapping and applause on returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although the 'no six' in Splitter's rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was fierce until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone won on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Eliase' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the 'yellow' return to the sun (50-49).
More inappropriate
Members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which, with three triples almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase, returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which the locals achieved at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Alawites bleached their skin in the final part, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to deprive them of the well-deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter excluded for a foul seIvanovic did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos, leaving him to lead Group B in the Euroleague in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The M<0xC3><0xA1>laga team was not afraid of the environment of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion, or of a rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubio, brightened the pitch with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned 22–20, minute 13, a moment when the battle between the USABeverleys and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to operate and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of an English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja team.
Between the domestic players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who, despite losing by 19, proved superior and even managed to make up the difference from the match in Malaga M<0xC3><0xA1>laga 66-48, minute 27, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages, Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and triple points, Cook and the contribution of Lewis, left some hope n winning 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he was unstoppable.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja withered and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads from real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates the salaries of users based on the more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to put the profession, years of experience, age and the city where you want to work.
During the week that the app was running, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels badly rewarded," Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, explained in his report.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while the Spanish receives 24,000.
The driver also earns <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 a year in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, in Spain the worst-paid waiter's job is with 11,592 euros net per year; followed by a salesman with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a time limit for Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than January 27, 2010, when his mandate officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, a charge d’affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, has confirmed to TV Globo that Mel knows it must leave the embassy by that date, where it has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his mandate, he has to leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: “I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain on the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that the de facto government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, had sought to impose on him.
Thank you.
After days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reemerged in the markets, which should not be surprising, as this is already a natural state in an environment where officials make decisions about the future, which in itself is uncertain.
The drug used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetise debt by directly buying assets and indirectly releasing liquidity at a near-zero rate so that financial institutions could purchase assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have practically ended, and without questioning their inconsistent liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into gears, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the world economy’s ability to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are taking part in a return to reducing risky returns.
The stock market’s volatility and bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
Once again, it is pushing for quality, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the haven chosen by investors, thus widening the differentiation of euro area countries towards Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction of the qualifications of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not unhelpful to silence moral risk advocates who have once again tried to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy with the inhibition of the devastating effects of credit-to-employee restrictions, when in fact a new Thanksgiving day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles among the emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides deficits, elections, and a new government enters.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin is forcing the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its own citizens accountable together in the face of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalization of the transitional risk premiums, after some excesses, the supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we need not worry.
If Europe's differences are reduced and ours continue to widen, it would be a typical Spanish risk.
The issue of Standard & Poor's is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most studio services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 ascension scenario, including the OCDE and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, for the Spanish economy there is little hope of living up to this warning.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "careful, my friend drivers".

Iberdrola President Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n was the first to intervene yesterday in front of a subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where he is discussing Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasec, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n provided the press with several comments on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of 50,000 million euros by 2020 and an additional 60,000 million euros from that date by 2030 if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are preserved.
If this does not happen, the necessary investments will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Indeed, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
As of 2020, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, he believes that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the women's bill on a sustainable economy that has just been approved by the government is in line with the line the company demanded, did not want to let go as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which is contrary to the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "precise" measure, as President Iberdrola called it.
Whatever it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, although long-term, need to start taking them now, because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins 'handling' Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swisssport, will play the role of preferential partner for Irish airlines Aero Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, which has not yet expired economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares yesterday signed a protocol of cooperation on the creation of a Center for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already works as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The five-kilometer-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concessional highway venture.
The city council wants the tunnel to be completed at the end of 2014.
After selecting public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Ernst & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the construction and operation of the toll.
Bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an expected investment of $1,700 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and three major European construction companies competing in the final stage.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
Acciona is being targeted by Northern Direct with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last company to pass the sieve is called LBRJV and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the construction company Hochtief, represented by ACS), also by the local Bauderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major company specializing in civil engineering Razel.
Australia’s infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatisation, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than through the indirect acquisition of a local construction firm.
In addition to Asian references, the strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted company Leighton.
Millions of Assets
Acciona bets on the geographical area of greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the desalination shop.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind park in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage desolation plants in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and operation of infrastructures.
Underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called Northern Link (northern link), is to connect the western highway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove circuit route (see map) in the length of the 5 km tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The calendar established by the local administration plans to be entered for the summer of 2010 and to start work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the works is planned until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to fund it.
Brisbane has already offered this job Hochtief
Australia still makes a significant profit, as it announced a deal with the government estimated at 154 million.
Through its local Leighton subsidiary, the joint-stock ACS will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of a German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the project of building the 27-story King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was yet to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O’Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded $64 million tunnel in Slovenia
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million allocation for the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company received the contract a few days after the work on the expansion of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to start in early 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Shh. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the past two years to Sra. Rushmore for an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Hi. Rushmore was selected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the contest launched by Renfe, of which four advanced to the finals, among them TBWA , which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for cracking down on competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean regions.
According to this institution, the operator has limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company has purchased more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers France Télécom to have committed a similar offence as in the past and therefore to have relapsed.
App Stores
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the outset, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 for entry into other countries like Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a since the beginning
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
The charter is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League does not only bring fame. It is also one of the main sources of income for large clubs.
To the extent that the competition divided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.362.5 million among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) that participated in the event since the tournament was launched in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money he received for participating, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the main prize three times.
Catalan current champion and the last winner of the 1992 European Cup is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also charged the most money for participating in the previous Champions League.
Both lost to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to receive the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money distribution procedure used by UEFA.
For this accounting year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to make $1,090 million for the Champions League.
With this money, UEFA is donating 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (among others Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
in addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each match in which they participate.
There is also a prize for the win (800,000 euros) and for the draw (400,000 euros for each team). The eight-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four gets four million.
The champion will earn 9 million, while the second finalist will earn 5.2 million.
Thus, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, for which 337,8 million are allocated.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four awarded places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of allotted money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% and 29.9% of Sos' capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (optional) of all securities.
In particular, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,505 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest on this deferral of 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company by 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the fair value of the Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the Sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, the sauce further changes the structure of its leadership.
In an attempt to stay on the margins of possible bids to buy and settle the court fluctuations of his former leaders, brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food business.
This is a newly created position that will be directly subordinated to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company continues to be immersed in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
In fact, the possibility that Sos will reveal new fund transfers in the coming months cannot be shredded.
As for the Salazar credit, former council members Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified yesterday before the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV authorises option to exclude Paternina participating in Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion of Inversora Mer against Federico Paternino on October 9.
The supervisory authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochure submitted after the adjustments introduced on 2 December is "sufficient".
The CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.08 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6.142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been immobilised, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer had been closed for which he specified that the price had been determined by Federic Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Car Valuation Tools
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car service earns.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are towed to a repair shop, where an expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex task.
Calculate the repair costs manually from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and insurance and maintenance estimation solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers to develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is a leading company; 80% of the evaluation is done with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation tools and developing information about the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not at all easy.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working in Spain, each providing them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been introduced in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these businesses will start working.
It is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "smart" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "pierce" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
The most exclusive models they have information about include Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
As for the mobile park in circulation, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centres distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million a year in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is added and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows businesses to use and provide different products.
The most common uses focus on repair and maintenance, but by country, there are also tools to control spare parts or to calculate the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
Considering the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product AudaPlus, a standard insurance award solution designed for connoisseurs.

In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or paintwork.
This instrument is paid according to the use for each evaluation.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
After that, each insurance company that makes thousands of estimates will negotiate its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it left the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to knock out vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.

Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
Among other things, it sells the Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.

Online Auction of Accident Vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after the insurance event.
The operation envisioned a subscription of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This pricing and buying and selling service is guaranteed exclusively to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, service providers, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before operations begin.
Founded in 1996 in Germany, the platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.

Vehicles of historical value may be permitted to operate, even if they have been discarded, following a preliminary procedure.
Service budget in four steps
With Auda-Taller, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: vehicle identification, spare part search, budget creation and budget generation.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for convincing senior professionals who are more or less restrained in the use of new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimation.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and rotate it to show the inside.
