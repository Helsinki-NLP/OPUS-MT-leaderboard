In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hanged had already attempted suicide.
October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoye at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he has already attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at his place of residence, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, committed suicide by hanging.
No signs of violent death were found, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky".
Is there a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a crumbling highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly mounted on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, tracking every mile a motorist drives and transmitting this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state’s planning authorities.
Usually, the boring arena of highway planning unexpectedly spawned intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and even possibly where you drive them — and then use that information to compile tax bills.
The Tea Party is in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can’t agree on whether to continue or not, a few states aren’t going to wait.
They are reflecting on how to move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“It’s not an issue on which we may have a choice,” said Hassan Ichrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to begin tracking the state’s mileage by every California motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
Technology already exists for this.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government Highway Construction Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars travel more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised in 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax by even one cent at high gasoline prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply impossible to save,” said Lee Mannich, an expert on transportation policy at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the false payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Boredom is called a false user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, because with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
Planners in California are looking into the system in developing strategies to meet the targets set by the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, House of Representatives member Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the chamber’s transport committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the free market at Reason are also thrilled that drivers will be forced to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward a false payment.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved some 10,000 vehicles.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or the city.
Several states and cities, however, follow this path on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of 17 East Coast states (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can make these changes.
This concept has not received universal recognition.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently fitted with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track their every move.
“Worrying about big brother and stuff like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
As the tests were underway, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale surveillance devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches are underway for low-cost technology that would allow state authorities to keep track of miles traveled by car, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more at ease.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not assist in collecting state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of a type of auto insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices she’s testing attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded via a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There were a few major errors in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less obsessive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with a variety of options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea to a wary public, forcing the devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are looking to develop a taxable device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide “pay-as-you-go” insurance, and collect real-time speed data pools from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be attracted to participate in the benefits that will be offered to them,” – stated in the document of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether all the talk of wrong payment is simply a huge distraction.
The San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the trust fund for highway construction by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid car drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgery when all you need to do is take an aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislation and Public Relations Commission.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a lot of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius summit.
A stand-by loan is being negotiated with the IMF, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements on funding terms.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive aid, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered the sovereign rating of Ukraine by one degree - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a back-up option to provide Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the Nord Stream or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversing supplies to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but through other routes,” the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconstruction and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where a strict quota of the increase in the number of private cars is introduced, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times higher than the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
Beijing’s Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” worth about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion) in 2012.
According to Lee Kunsheng, director of the transport pollution control department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, to increase the number of private cars to no more than 6 million (currently 5.2 million), and to increase fuel use by no more than 5% per vehicle.
According to the agency, now motor vehicles in Beijing are responsible for 22.5 percent of the total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year plan" include the accelerated compared to the rest of the country transition to electric fuel standards, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with electric or hybrid vehicles).
Among the automotive innovations of Beijing also includes a ban on all private cars to drive within the fifth transport ring (there are six in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the license plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of license plates for cars based on the lottery (for example, in 2011, the first year of operation of the lottery, the total number of license plates in the third part of the license plate).
According to the current state program “Environmental Protection 2012-2020”, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, “mobile sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
Russia is just beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips are obviously unpopular, they can be adopted by society only under the condition of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - service and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow's fleet).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study that analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice less than required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking spaces, but car storage, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (so that the streets become more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the historical center protection zone (a total area of about 3,212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase at times
According to the city authorities, the increase in the amount of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, and the products they sell often do not pass the proper sanitary control.
And this means that the health of wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Administration of Vologda.
Goldman Sachs Warns of Risks to Russian Economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth: consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment on unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather that the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is fully driven by consumption, which almost does not reduce turnover,” said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
The nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With an inflation rate of 6%, it will be able to meet future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so they are likely to optimize personnel costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - said Mr. Grafe.
Companies are facing a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to layoffs and rising unemployment.
Russian business cannot raise wages, comments chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment is near historic lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees from the sidelines or keep current ones, employers have to raise wages.
Consumption in Russia is supported by the very rapid growth of borrowing.
According to Mr. Grafe, due to the extremely high rates of consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of borrowing, the money does not diverge in the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments," the economist said.
But the problem is that Goldman Sachs expects a rise in defaults on unsecured loans.
They are taken mostly by poor people who have nothing to provide for security.
The interest rates for such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” Mr. Grafe said.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment on unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of HSE Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of a brewing banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, lacking access to cheap resources such as the state banks, were forced to attract the funds of the population at high interest rates.
In response, state banks took the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state banks do not refuse dumping, Russia is threatened with a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers a harbinger of mass collapse.
“State banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was originally not designed for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institute warns.
But consumption growth will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, according to the investment bank, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs on natural monopolies (and, as a consequence, by a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and the prerequisites for this are not yet - see the certificate), the growth of consumption will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushin of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in oil prices,” he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to shrink at an oil price below $ 90 / barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,” said Clemens Grafe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it affects only interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not for lending to the economy, and to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, this means that the funds are trying to go to speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,” Mr. Grafe said and reminded that the state plans to release the ruble into the “free float” by the end of 2015.
But we will either have to do it sooner or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the ruble is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
There is only one way to get weak, the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank plunges in the financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more.
In Chelyabinsk, the Second Congress of the Peoples of the South Urals was held.
The forum is dedicated to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
Here we can show an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences or disagreements.
We live in complete understanding,” says Feofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoust.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
Following the meeting, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued in the theater of opera and ballet.
An exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to “collaborate” with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, were unable to answer questions about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, who was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that offer no protection whatsoever.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that support from the international community could convince the U.S. government to drop criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become tense after allegations that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a lawmaker who heads a parliamentary group overseeing intelligence, said that if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or destroying relations with the United States completely,” it should be used.
Mr. Ströbele, a Green German MP, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left.
If Mr. Snowden were testifying in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “tough and ongoing” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global response to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — found exposing the uncontrolled system of all-pervasive surveillance useful to society.
The letter offers to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board its flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers could keep the entire bank.
The new hand luggage charge applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travelers paid only when they were on board.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said a $100 fee should force passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for it,” she said.
Airlines began charging for the first and second bags to be checked in in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges are stuffed as much as they can in hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why there is often not enough space in these compartments.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new fee isn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the upper luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the entrance to the Frontier flight may be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change in procedures on the website and Frontier’s check-in desks is meant to ensure passengers are aware of the collection before they get to the boarding gate.
Frontier’s new hand luggage charge will not start until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover flight costs after years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first hand luggage charge three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
According to his assessment in a December 2011 report, the hand luggage fee brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager of Midwest Airlines, had recently flown a Spirit flight, and he was interested in what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers faced an unusual collection of Spirit for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see the gnashing of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit in terms of a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who receive soda or juice could keep the entire pot and that a coffee pot would be provided free of charge.
It will continue to distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but dropped it seven months later after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
Frontier’s hand luggage charge initiative, where passengers don’t buy tickets directly from the airline, is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, between $10 and $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting a travel online agency.
However, Frontier went further than anyone in this area.
In September, it began giving twice as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the mileage.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity fell nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames ‘internal error’, not hackers for shutting down site
The secretive National Security Agency said Friday evening that shutting down their site for a few hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the downtime was caused by a distributed denial-of-service [DDoS] attack are false.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems registered that the NSA website had not worked for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal secret network had “not” been hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said it was responsible for disabling the NSA website through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The previously top-secret NSA, once dubbed “No Such Agency,” has been in the spotlight in recent months after a string of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically — all in response to secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by a frustrated former NSA employee, Edward S.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted hackers’ actions.
Bombardier’s profit decreases with falling deliveries and the number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 percent reduction in net profit amid a decline in third-quarter orders and deliveries and contract issues at its rail division.
The Montreal-based Bombardier company also did not release any flight test data for its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of the prototype aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the test phase is on schedule.
The results did not meet the forecasts and led to a fall in shares of more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, cut his valuation from “above the mid-market” to “mid-market” on Thursday because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in aircraft shipments was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department’s profit figures,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and first flew in September after several months of delay.
However, there are not too many firm orders for the CSeries so far – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to test the company’s claims about fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouin was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft was put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, leaders also assured analysts and the media that the program is moving forward as planned.
“The aircraft’s test model did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Baudouin said during a phone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the aircraft’s downtime.
All manufacturers plan their tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all others will follow soon, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical of the claim that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is estimating the date of commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, ending September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly - from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft for the quarter, down from 57 the previous year.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The aerospace department’s order portfolio was $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results were consistent with our goals, but the small number of incoming orders and overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Baudouan said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $ 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than on December 31.
The revenues of the transport division were negatively affected by the problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pitchett would join the board of directors, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at mid-Thursday’s auction.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10 percent reduction in quarterly revenue.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer Sony, having completed the previous quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, shortened the forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s performance between July and September 2013 was more disappointing than expected due to a drop in demand for TVs, video cameras and personal computers produced by the Japanese corporation.
Sony’s TV business, which generated its first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years in the second quarter, fell again to 9.3 billion yen in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is going through a difficult time, especially due to the declining demand for televisions.
And while competitors are looking for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure will be much higher and will be 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable features that will get rid of the need for 100 times a day to get out of your pocket smartphone.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and earnings forecast, the company’s shares lost more than 11% in the morning at the opening of Tokyo markets, falling to 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene was a stimulant of the formation of synapses
Scientists at Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein by which Foxp2’s “speech gene” performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The researchers found that family members had impaired the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.
In the new study, biologists have shown that at least some of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant of the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
This is due to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of searching for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, and only Foxp2 is responsible for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization, scientists confirmed in an experiment on mice.
When the animals’ gene activity was artificially reduced, they shouted less when parting with their mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the sounds produced was restored.
Previously, mice also showed a link to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene ate more actively and at a lower frequency than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is associated with purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine-addicted lawyer who warned a gang leader about a police investigation has been jailed
42-year-old Basharat Ditta passed information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was jailed for three years.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta gave criminal authority Neil Scarborough classified information about his drug trafficking investigation after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash and nicknamed a “cool lawyer” among criminals, was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police operation to spy on Scarborough, whom he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed how 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in the town of Blackburn County, Lancashire, while he was at a lawyer’s association dinner with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly using” a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet, and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later jailed after police seized <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
The 42-year-old Ditta passed on the information to the criminals because of fears that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today at the Liverpool Royal Court Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was covered with shame after acknowledging his guilt in two cases of intentional obstruction of justice following a three-week trial at the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at one of his previous court hearings.
The lawyer’s exposure came after police investigating Scarborough’s activities found that he had been talking to Ditta regularly on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and discovered how he approached Ditt's house in Blackburn and placed the drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash cans.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found out that Ditta was “regularly using” cocaine after tests found traces of the class A drug in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he spoke to a suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, he also had a hair sample taken.
At a police interrogation, he said he had a home office, along with a job, and clients came to his home for legal reasons.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of which he had previously represented in court, to tell what the detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Anne White said: “If anyone knows that you shouldn’t break the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying his own lawyer.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He has prevented police investigations as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced it.
He became too close to certain clients, in particular Scarborough, and allowed himself to doubt his disinterest.
Ditta pleaded not guilty and said, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to give information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he started buying drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the goals of the main members of the criminal gangs, who instructed him to extract valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to cover up his profession.
Mr. Ditt ' s investigation was conducted by Lancashire ' s Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which had already reached his verdict in three cases of cocaine possession, and now also on obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer conversation, in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with the death penalty in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner is Muhammad Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, police officers who attended the meeting of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation today noted.
The ticket program is overstated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia with "Spartacus" was used only a thousand stewards at the regular rate of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2,200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, in agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the KDC Arthur Grigoriantz.
Americans overheard Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official who chose not to reveal his name said the U.S. overheard phone calls from senior Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the land of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, as well as Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, the NHK TV channel reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on this information yet.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the U.S. intelligence services for the chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have tapped Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, which she believes are Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with German prosecutors.
The German flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA officer.
Bashkiria may put up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria, in the course of state procurement interventions, can put grain to auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, and there is demand.
"Maybe the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at a news conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, crops under the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereals - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
550 thousand hectares were sown under the harvest in 2014 (by 105 thousand hectares more than in 2012).
Increased areas for winter wheat and triticale, rye remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brotherly Circle" to which in the United States was listed Leps
The databases of the Russian security forces of the group “Brotherly Circle”, to which Washington has listed the singer Grigory Leps, is not listed.
As noted by "Interfax" in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media appeared reports about the inclusion of the US Treasury Department Grigory Leps in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brotherly Circle", all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The spread of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
“Even in the very name – ‘Brotherly Circle’, there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
"All this is very similar to a PR action," the agency's interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury Department announced that it had entered into its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle” of Artur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadym Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
The individuals on the list are suspected of links to some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps “serves as a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev.”
In the production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the US accusations against the singer, calling them “crazy”.
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama classified the Brotherhood Syndicate as “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and instructed the Treasury to “undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations.”
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury entails blocking his assets in the U.S. and banning him from business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Scandalous video hit the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless pranks, got caught smoking crack.
Police in the Canadian city said they had a videotape and were ready to launch an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford, appeared on the website of the Toronto police.
The head of local law enforcement agencies Bill Blair held a press conference on this issue.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the footage with the public, but he vouched for its existence.
According to Blair, the compromising video of Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards of the order in the summer of 2013.
Earlier, the Canadian press wrote about the existence of this video, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says that he is not guilty of anything and is not going to resign.
The video is one of the evidence in the case of Ford’s 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of drug trafficking, extortion, illicit income, and criminal conspiracy.
At times, Lisi acted as Rob Ford's driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken manner, allowed himself to make racist and sexist statements.
Rostovaeroinvest has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the object.

A politician in Turkey has declared a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began the construction of a separation wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish PMD party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaybin, Ayse Gekhan, on the border with Syria, declared a hunger strike, protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly dispersed protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the fact of construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure border security.
“The mayor of Nusaybin, Ayse Gekhan, a member of the PMD, has declared a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly fight,” the party’s press service said.
The mayor believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation that the Kurds will never agree with,” Ayse Gekhan said.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of a separation wall is planned in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, the Bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange the equivalent of ten thousand US dollars for a year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the country’s purchased bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific course of the bolivar against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil Minister Rafael Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information provided by the agency, Caracas may still decide to reduce the exchange rate of the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing the prices of products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that in Venezuela there was a shortage of toilet paper.
Yugra director Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so I am not ready to say how long it will take to find a new coach,” Belmach told ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We are looking at all possible options.
Priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judicial system in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, the parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news site.
He said the new media court would “always be biased because it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media with a dead-end grip” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have taken a serious blow” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media angered authorities by broadcasting surveillance footage of troops being sent to the attack site allegedly plundering an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimayo responded by calling two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being “excluded from the list”, that is, getting a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the offender's property if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “living blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by keeping the media quiet, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
“Nobody will ever know,” Mutuma Matthew, a Nation journalist, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“Self-provided politicians will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been targets of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to lift the cuts imposed by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
In the utility payments of Voronezh residents will appear a new line of expenses - deductions for overhaul of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, to put in order the staircases or even to replace the elevator - will decide the tenants themselves.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to restore order - to establish the order of the house, to accumulate funds not in management companies - which often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere else, this will be the establishment of state control over the spending of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Now under the control of the state and share construction.
The law, which protects against fraud, was approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people were injured by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority have been solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in equity construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area too began the abuses associated with the fact that in 98-th year the shareholders were the same, and in 2000-th years the same shareholders."
People started making money on it to cover the loophole, including passing these two laws.
At Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems related to illegal migrants in the region are at least addressed.
Last year, a little more than 100,000 foreigners entered the migration register.
But only one in five has issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the legislation, but are not criminals."
There's no court, but they have to be deported - they have to be kept somewhere.
This decision of the Federation has taken that at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is determined - it is the Old Olshanka of the Semiluk district.
Well, and finally, the regional parliament gave new benefits to many parents.
First, families where 5 or more children are raised are completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same savings and many parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will issue subsidies for housing.
For each family member, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
A family, for example, of 6 people - father, mother, native child and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can buy a whole cottage.
Baumgertner nominated to the board of directors of Uralkali
The current board of directors of JSC "Uralkali" proposed the candidacy of the arrested in Minsk CEO Vladislav Baumgertner to the new composition of the board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bamugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated to the new board of directors.

Later, however, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said at a press conference that Baumgertner's accusations were reclassified as "theft".
The goalkeeper of "Petrochemist" Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krykunov from the post of mentor of the lower Kamets.
The goalkeeper believes that acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his duties.
We will remind, today "Petrochemist" sent Krykunov to resign.

In the team, he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely awaits a great future.

According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.

U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes “went too far” when collecting data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that in the collection of data and wiretapping, the U.S. intelligence services sometimes “go too far”, however, the politician noted that the information appeared in the media about the wiretapping of 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases it went too far and was illegal.
I recognize this, as the president also acknowledges... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” he said.
Italian workers with experience give way to young people
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country's population is now unemployed.
Things haven’t been that bad since World War II.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already carried out by the largest energy company of the country, and the adopted laws allow the regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for workers with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy awaits the common problem of an ageing population for Europe.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify itself.
What will the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transfer hubs (TPUs).
By 2020, 255 TPUs are planned to be commissioned.
What actually turns the project, understood our correspondent.
A couple of months ago, at the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line there was a construction fence.
The inscription said that the transport and transfer node was being arranged.
All this was very strange, because near the "Smolensk" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the land crossing through the Karmanitsky Lane.
Now Smolenskaya is almost finished.
A flower shop disappeared, a newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt in front of the entrance was replaced by a paving slab.
That's the whole transport node.
Transport and transfer hubs are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the capital's Department of transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial objects that impede the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transport workers, but professional decorators from the capital repair department of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a dashboard that warns about the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, at the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a full-fledged flat junction.
Let it be without canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and a scoreboard indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number of officials write in the TPU everything they get.
Back in 2011, the mayor’s office planned to build all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now in the plans until 2020 there are up to 255 TPUs.
One-and-a-half of them are expected to pass this year.
Although the city has a program for the development of TPU, there are no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
Reported by the number of objects, but the quality of transplantation on each of them often deteriorates.
According to the expert, there should be two criteria: first - a reduction in the time of transplant, second - convenience.
First of all, the opportunity to change the mode of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, in the arrangement of TPU sometimes comes out exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the metro "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the street of Cosmonauts.
Farther from the metro, much farther from the monorail, but closer to residential houses.
The residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained about all possible instances.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately ask.
The first of them began to build five years ago at the metro "Planernaya".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how a transplant node, given to investors for a ransom, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are bus aprons, a canopy to keep out of the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking lots.
However, the chemical trolleybuses No202 and No203 in the Moscow TPU were not given places in principle.
They were pushed away from the subway like strangers.
There is more room for trade.
There are only 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pets to car dealerships.
In fact, who among the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason we always get a shopping center.
Recently, the situation reached its logical conclusion when part of the parking lot decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor parking spaces is a boycott trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards looking evil at our photographer.
The junction finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier, the subway "Planernaya" had a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, the merchants were regretted and allowed to the interception parking of the junction.
Due to the high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's the rock.
At the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance of access from the lobby of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it in the open air.
However, the designs on the "Planner" and "Kaluga" will soon appear flowers.
In mid-September, the City Planning and Land Commission of the Municipality approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, excluding two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow at the metro "Tushino", it will be 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations of the Russian Railways, responsible for the construction of TPU near the metro, have already told journalists: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-tiered parking lots are from a third to half the area.
Let’s take the example of the garage.
For example, the garage for 258 car seats, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for a parking lot for 2.6 thousand cars, Petrovsko-Razumovskaya will need about 80 thousand square meters.
That's less than a third of the machine they're going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all kinds of bus aprons.
There are at least 150 thousand square meters of commercial real estate.
And this, for a minute, is almost two gums.
If capital TPUs at stations and stations are built by railway workers, then the rest of the sites will be developed by metropolitan residents.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities,” including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for the TPU to officials directly.
Without any competitions.
It is said that transportation is a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or the Spadina station in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going outside.
There is no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are thrown into extremes.
Either we don't build anything, or we're going to build 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremism
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, "Fair Russia" proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and punish it with five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the Deputy Chairman of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for an opinion to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of state power - the flag and the coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings may be affected by insults to state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, has not been worked out enough in the Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites the discussions unfolding annually on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real baccalaureate takes place every year.
Exercising in wit and an “alternative view” of history, some publicists come to the conclusion that, to say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where the pride of history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation, Oleg Mikheev is outraged.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost impunity.
In the opinion of the people’s elector, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and prescribe the appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a fine of 100,000 to a five-year prison sentence.
The magnitude 6.6 earthquake occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The focus of the earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers southwest of the city, according to the website of the United States Geological Survey (USGS).
Shots were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
Nothing has been reported about the victims or the destruction caused by the tremors.
Chile is located in one of the most seismic regions of the Earth, so earthquakes of different strengths are not uncommon there.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220,000 buildings.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people died as a result of this natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace case will be treated fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian law.
France can have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in accordance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the law," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisan, as well as other activists, are charged with hooliganism.
“I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,” Ero told RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects are “like a powder keg”, and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
UN announces new targets to tackle poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty worldwide.
Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the summit that now is the time to “become above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating the universal SDGs,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development vision.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by Member States to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Concerns over security in Mozambique are on the rise as a result of the conflict of influential people
Beneath the statue of Zamora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, chief executive of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a t-shirt decorated with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined a crowd in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the most violent clashes since the armistice was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known insurgent movement that was supported first by the white Rhodesian authorities and then by the apartheid-era South African government as part of efforts to destabilize the country’s independent government.
After the 1992 armistice, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to plunge into a full-scale conflict again, but recent events have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal fields in the northwest could raise more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, a leading political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
The Renamo party claims that the government has become the instigator of the latest clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on former insurgents then escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, said Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, in a statement to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for initiating the clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Gebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Gebuza told AFP, a French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama felt he was a “loser” who wanted to use “everything left of his forces to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renamo's rejection of the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he was referring to the Frelimo party’s non-compliance with the agreement.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tensions that have been heightened by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebusa and Dhlakama) facing each other’s foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to push for electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to seek concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
Renamo's vote share has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to step down next year when his second term ended, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key north-south highway.
Most of the skirmishes took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies including Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazanga was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has intensified government dissatisfaction, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who should find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said people just want stability.
“Nobody cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore peace, they want free access to roads,” he said.
A series of premiere film screenings "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of film screenings "Art-mainstream", where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held in the cinema "Rolan" from 1 to 5 November, RIA "News" with reference to the organizers of the project.
Opening the program "Art-mainstream" French comedy director and actress Reim Kerichi "Paris at All Costs".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital Maya (Kerici herself), who due to problems with a visa is deported to his homeland - to Morocco.
In addition to the film, Kerichi will also show the audience a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki-dook "Mobius", Oliver Hirschbiegel's melodramatic biopic "Diana: the story of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the lead role and the main film of the Cannes film festival "Jizn" held in May.
The only Russian participant of "Art-mainstream" will be the winner at the festival "Kinotavr" film of Alexander Veledinsky "The Geographer of the Globe Spilled" based on the novel of the same name by Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming loser-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Khabensky, whose work was also awarded the prize "Kinotavr".
Children should study myths and legends as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
The tales of the Torah could show that “rough force cannot defeat sophisticated cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates a “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I've been advocating for their introduction to the curriculum for 20 years.
He added that the “excessive moralization” of authors and teachers “disinterests” children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote The Norwegian Myths Collection for Penguin and British Folktales, said, “You may have intentions, but you’d better keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there should be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And this must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly articulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Gryazy-Voronezh, transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of your favorite team, the guys on the way made a drunken debacle on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty station of the line police department at Grjazi station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offence.
There, the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the building of the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the front door window in the waiting room of the station with his foot.
A transport police officer and a security guard of the Russian Railways (RZD) attacked the broken glass.
They managed to detain the attacker who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are conducting an inspection.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being resolved, said the senior referee of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Vitaly Mutko: Waterjets?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sports events are responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we can see that they took a different position.
They are waiting for someone from the outside to come and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let things go by themselves.
We have now developed a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once this is done, we will take up the issue.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, say, let's get the law fast.
It feels like the fans of "Bavaria" came to Yaroslavl and all this was arranged.
We are outside observers.
And in general, it is terrible to see the tribune watered from the brandpoint.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I have the feeling that we came back 10-15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify on the wiretapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone calls.
According to Interfax on Friday, a source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions of representatives of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside Russia is almost excluded.
“In this case, he will lose his refugee status and can be issued to Washington by the U.S. allies,” the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send representatives to Russia or transfer written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that the issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Ströbele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the US intelligence services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-CIA officer has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the NSA blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the Interfax source’s statement, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how would be up to him.
Edward Snowden, a U.S. citizen who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about the secret operations of the U.S. intelligence agencies for surveillance on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was revoked by the US authorities, who in absentia brought serious charges against him, and until the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of the Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and left Sheremetyevo on the same day.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a “large Russian company”.
German media reported about the NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel last week.
According to journalists, the telephone conversations of the chancellor, the Americans began to listen in 2002.
The surveillance station was allegedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, after the publication of this information, said that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev left “Fair Russia”
Deputy of the State Duma from the party "Fair Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev has filed a request to withdraw from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted the application to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the “Righteous”.
We sit, we drink tea...
"For some reason, many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal about it," the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the "SSRs".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot legally leave it.
Reports about the intention of Ilya Ponomarev to leave the party "Fair Russia" appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov would leave the SR with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan to discuss peace treaty with Russia
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisida said at the meeting.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will go to meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the question of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of the land lost after the Second World War.
The Japanese capital is driven by cars, from which the loudspeaker says: "Return the northern territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It is safe to say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, pop artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference attendant at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes directly to the public in a conversational manner.
Faye’s innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolinas stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at the Carolinas and then achieved more success, reaching a level where they’re already too famous to play at the club,” Hursh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as Standup for Heroes, an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby among others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example through shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became famous for his role in the comedy series on the little-known cable channel (especially the scathing "League" on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate joined the cast of both “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recreation Areas”, although she is best known for the series of viral videos “Marseille – Shell in Boots”.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with an original style (surrealistically pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, cunning, focused on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be an interview between David Steinberg and Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in film, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely a central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some street between two houses and thinks, "If I'm out of money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The Pakistani Prime Minister made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister said that dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with Pakistan’s constitution,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern areas of the country, bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban is seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
The Islamabad government has tried to start talks with the local Taliban, but the movement has refused to engage in dialogue.
It said it would only negotiate if the authorities withdrew troops stationed in Taliban-affiliated areas and freed arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 a barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about large reserves overshadowed the message that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining momentum.
The U.S. benchmark oil in December’s supply fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for the late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in October price by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. reserves had increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, the reserves were replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about the Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil, the benchmark of international oil used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
Colorado head coach Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor "CE" Natalia Shmeleva.
"What are we waiting for?" said Rua after the morning sprint of "Lavin".
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you are absolutely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him guard the gates, as was the case in the previous matches of this season.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be vegan: greenhouse tomato will not replace soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, RIA Novosti reported.
People who have completely abandoned products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not endure the winter without losses for health, and no greenhouse tomatoes do not compensate them, according to Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drink oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are sure that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not good for health.
A complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetable ones.
It is necessary to include in the diet at least milk or eggs, "- says dietitian Marina Bogai.
She gives an example of fish containing essential fatty acid Omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the necessary quantities for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the inhabitants of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in winter.
This season, vegetarianism is especially questioned.
In terms of our realities, high demands are placed on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, accordingly, he is lacking in this caloric content," - says the specialist.
The nutritionist Olga Poznyak agrees with this.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not the way out.
It is better for a person to eat mainly products that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set to better assimilate and digest these products.
And in winter, people want not a cucumber to bite, but a hot soup or something more satisfying,” explains the doctor.
According to her, from the fact that vegans can eat, a variety of cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is not enough for a full meal.
According to gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, Siberians have sufficient levels of vitamins only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and snow lies in May, is impractical.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat," the medic says.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful for children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by sticking to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegans don’t get them,” Bogai said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, “to play the toys he wants.”
He has already formed an organism, a skeleton, organs.
Children should still eat well.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored,” she says.
All surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of winter grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses, contains less micronutrients than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of the products is not that,” says Bohai.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
“Apples do not turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and moldy, tomatoes are tasteless and unflavored,” the medic cites examples, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This does not agree with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agrarian Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables.
If they try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened," she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
The court suspended the enforcement of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-visit” in the New York police department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department’s “stop-and-visit” program and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second District said that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shera Sheindlin will be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, a judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way it was carrying out a program of street arrests and interrogations.
The city appealed its decision and corrective measures, including the appointment of a controller to help the police department change its practice and related training programme.
On Thursday, the appeals court heard the hearing of the parties on the application for suspension of the case.
The appeals court said the judge needed to be removed because it violated the U.S. code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid displaying bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably appealing to blacks and Hispanics under the “stop-and-visit” program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in those police stations where most arrests occur.
In August, New York City decided to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were terminated after a police check.
The city's appeals debate is due to take place after March 14, 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
“Stop Search” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 people in 2011, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the “stop-and-visit” program at the New York Police Department say the changes will put an end to unfair practices, create a more reliable and effective police service, and may affect how other police departments implement the practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult police conditions due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not stop the practice of “stop-and-visit,” which is in line with the constitution, but changed the way the New York police stopped people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
There is a new pedestrian zone in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a plot two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.
Street flooring, flower shops, benches, urns and toilets were installed throughout, deaf fences and illegal advertising were removed.
In addition to Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky avenues, which were already pedestrian, five streets were closed to cars - Ordynsky dead end, Big and Small Tolmachevsky avenues, Kadashevsky embankment and Bolotnaya Square.
Traffic on the streets of Maroseika and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Pyatnitskaya street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky lane conditions for pedestrians created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, completely pedestrian became Tverskaya Proezd, Stoleshnikov Lane and Kuznetsky Most Street.
Great Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson used his phone to verify a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel of Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, the royal lawyer Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World received unreliable news that Clark was dating his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcayre to hack Polby’s voicemail and stalked her at home to interview her, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand next to someone’s house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer history to people to see what they will say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the newspaper News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors of Clark’s novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby said, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape with voice messages received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulcayre's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found recordings on the private investigator’s computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserap were monitoring Ms. Polby's movements.
Leaving her voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and I'd really like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Edis said Coulson’s involvement in the story followed the same scenario as that of other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating a co-conspirator, Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied collusion with other people for the purpose of hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Turlbeck and Weserap confessed to breaking their phones.
Snowden declares readiness to talk with the authorities of Germany in the case of wiretapping
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so and to meet with representatives of the German authorities, RIA Novosti reports.
A letter from a former CIA officer to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele, through whom Snowden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Strebele met with Snowden in Moscow the previous day.
Four people were injured in a fire on Tverskaya Street
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, injured passers-by, who were during the fire in a smoky underground passage.
According to RIA Novosti with reference to the head of the capital's Department of fuel and energy management Pavel Livinsky, currently in all houses on Tverskaya street completely restored electricity supply.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred on the evening of October 31.
From the hatches of storm sewers went strong smoke, and in the underground passage, located near the store "Armenia", there was smoke.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were defused.
At 21:45 Moscow time, the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
The food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 per month
As of Friday, the financial provision of food stamps known as “food stamps” will be reduced in the United States as the corresponding state program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less per month than before, officials said.
This will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year, the per-person allowance averaged $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the U.S. rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14% of Americans rely on free food aid from “food stamps” that have been called “food stamps” since they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, are demanding further cuts to the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Food shop owners across America worry that cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. Congressmen continue to debate how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard releases 19-year-old platformer for free
Blizzard released its 1994 Blackthorne platform for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to his data, the game became available on Battle.net in the section of classic games Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that at present, only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
The game is also not available to Russian users.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC, looks no different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack for Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, was originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vloros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The protagonist of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight Sarlak's minions and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game released by the studio after its renaming as Blizzard Entertainment.
Previously, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthorne was published by Interplay.
In the Moscow metro will be new machines.
But they will not sell tickets to passengers for money, but for squats.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 squats.
The number of squats will count a special device with the help of modern technologies, according to ITAR-TASS, citing the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the "Exhibition" station on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket sports machines will be accepted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexey Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency Acknowledgments Increase Corporate Paranoia over State Surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to instructions from the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the internal intelligence service of Germany, his task was to photograph the roof of the U.S. Mission building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect the antennas of the eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, reassured in September that the U.S. is not using foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal foreign companies’ trade secrets in the interests of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted at his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised corporate paranoia caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been tapped, perhaps for about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made it clear that there is intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the US now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
However, all documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden have so far contained no evidence that the U.S. has transferred foreign companies’ trade secrets to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and Internet capabilities, and have expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
All except the IT industry.
Yet the reach and technical development of the U.S. espionage agencies, which have become famous for Snowden’s revelations, has been a shock to some companies that previously thought China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A big shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European business leaders are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants have abandoned plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. Prism data intelligence program.
Jim Sneeb, one of SAP’s chief executives, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t come up a year ago, namely where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
What is happening to economic espionage is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF’s chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this may give an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, it has long been understood that taking a free flash drive at an exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it’s been standard practice for years to assemble mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the German Constitution recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during overseas travel due to smartphone vulnerabilities.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently thrown away.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the expertise, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies about economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row of violators who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of France’s internal intelligence agency DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teenager who died by “ridiculous accident” believe their son was killed
Parents of a Georgia teenager whose body was found inside a collapsed sports mat in his high school gymnasium believe their son was killed, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mat, leaning behind the stands in the gymnasium of his high school.
Lawndes County Sheriff’s Department investigators have concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager disputes this.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” said Benjamin Kramp, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
“They think it’s against logic, against the laws of physics, and against common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and he was returned to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I hold the view that there are sufficient grounds” for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the primary autopsy showed Johnson had died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he found enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokeswoman for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Department was not available for comment when contacted on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras that were viewed by investigators.
The teenager’s parents said they hoped the videos contained a clue to how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about persons who hung fascist symbols
On the official website of "Spartacus" there was a statement of the Moscow club about the appearance of a fascist flag on the podium in Yaroslavl.
"At the Cup match "Shinnik" - "Spartak" on October 30, unknown provocateurs in the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offense, with the request to provide it to the <0x3C>security service of FC "Spartak-Moscow" at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
“Remuneration is guaranteed,” the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung a fascist flag in Yaroslavl
Recall that in the match of the 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots in the stands.
Also in the sector of fans of "Spartacus" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
As a punishment, Spartak can play about three matches without spectators.
The committee will meet on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and hung this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations for schools on allergies in children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the US government, while the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is growing.
One in 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and caregivers about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenalin stores — most commonly used for injections with the EpiPen auto-medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have experienced an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is sticking into my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “The tongue is pinching.”
Parents of intersex children may choose “unspecified sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third gender in children born with external genitalia of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be attributed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “unspecified” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to relieve the pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the sex assignment operation to newborns and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I'm going to be a doctor-made patchwork with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual development disorder" - a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the U.S. say that if gender cannot be identified, it is better to take advantage of all available information and appropriate it than to wait and monitor the child’s psychological and physical development before surgery, if any.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery about why people are homosexual.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transgender or transgender people, because their condition is related not to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, and is typical for both of them at the same time or is not characteristic of either of them.
These characteristics may be manifested in secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary sexual characteristics, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudiced crimes.
Boys with gender differences now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to put male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the first person in the world to be recognized as "genderless", defending in court the right to maintain "uncertain" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports will use a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, a prominent Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
Catholic Online also disagreed with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state, where gender is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are turning two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer children to have sex at birth.
“Bringing up a child is difficult enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know the sex of your child,” she told the website for parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, by the name of a beautiful Greek god who possessed the characteristics of both sexes.
And just ten years ago, the medical community perceived gender as a sheet on which to erase everything and then draw again.
But now many challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the gender assigned to him when he grows up.
“In the middle of the 20th century, this was called an ‘emergency psychiatric case,’” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate-type genitalia was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easily amenable to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals — the way parents raise a child — interact with a child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis had been damaged during careless circumcision, to castrate the child completely, removing also his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of transition, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that now some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these gender reassignment operations declared themselves “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate-type genitalia.
The doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live the “full life” of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's outer genital organ and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he found out was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal genital development.
Having learned the truth, he again became a man, getting injections of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “incites labelling and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an ‘unspecified gender’,” she said.
We are afraid that he will contribute to the intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal gender,” she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist-radiologist who has a daughter with a disability and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a developmental disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because its androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie developed female symptoms.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and undergoes residency in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions on their own,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do some tests and figure out the situation, as well as the amount of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are fine - raise a child, love a child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that moves parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with, and this is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed that he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two matches of the Hawks, Habibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four goals from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed goal.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not succeed, - quotes CSNChicago words Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I should probably approach them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But somehow, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The goalkeepers - I don't think I'm alone - are always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what's going on in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself not to miss so many pucks.
It’s great that my teammates support me, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games isn’t the whole season, but I wanted to play them a lot better.
But what happened is what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I’m just going to try to play the next game better.
In the Altai turned the bus.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory, the PAZ bus turned over.
As a result of the accident, according to the updated data, 13 people were injured, reported in the regional management of the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
Earlier, the law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.

Medvedev expects SSJ-100 to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidation in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Interfax quoted Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev as saying at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation was established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that after this aircraft strengthens in the markets of Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
"I hope that it will one day be delivered to France," the Russian prime minister said.
The SSJ-100 was built by Civil Aircraft Sukhoi in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
The power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk region have started a unique program to save... nests of asts
In the old days, to bring the aists to the court, the peasants on a high pole installed a wheel from the cart, and the heavy nest was well held on it.
Such special supports have not been installed for a long time, so the aists favored the poles of power lines - the intertwined branches rely on wires, so that the aist house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lived a true family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new branches on top, and the lower layer has already passed between the wires, it is about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of Aists, who every year nested at the yard, bred and fed for the summer three or four chicks, but even without light do not want to remain.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, grandmother Anya called Tsarichansky RES, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still holds, - said technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, began corrosion.
Birds could die from electric shock at any time.
And the locals risked being left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear installers began an operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from the Dnipropetrovsk National University helped, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The well-known Dnepropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised power engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
For starters, it was estimated that there are more than 50 “apartments” in the area in an emergency state.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms reminiscent of a funnel were welded.
The base was weaved with weed branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, the squirrels will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of the Novomoskovsky district.
Next to the electrical support, a new reinforced concrete pillar was placed and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost the energy industry nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same new home took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the courtyard of Grandma Ani.
Here, the platform was fixed in its former place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
Until the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of the Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The other day, a sad news flew around the whole area - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers shot a swan family living on the local pond for entertainment.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not hurt them.
When the villagers heard the shots and ran to the pond, the four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now employees of the Apostolovsky district police department find out who shot the birds listed in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular.
On November 4, the Day of National Unity, the "Russian March" agreed with the city hall will be held in Moscow.
According to a poll by the Levada Center, support for the “Russian Marches” is growing - already 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the idea of their conduct.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the "Russian Marches": 11% of them are definitely positive about such actions and 29% - "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian Marches" is gradually growing - in 2006, these actions were welcomed by only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010, the holding of such events was supported by twice as many citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to the "Russian marches" are only 7% of Russians, "rather negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow city hall agreed to hold a “Russian march” of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Alexey Mayorov, said today.
This nationalist event has been held every year on National Unity Day since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard about the fact that on November 4 in Russia are held "Russian marches" under the slogans of protecting the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) knows about this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010, almost a third of citizens (31%) heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago on December 11, on Manege Square, a spontaneous rally of nationalists took place, which turned into mass riots.
Levada Center also asked Russians what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of those who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens gather to celebrate this holiday.
About the same number (17%) intend to celebrate the 7th of November Day of the October Revolution.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall agreed on the “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was announced by the leader of the association "Russians", the organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the procession in Lublin on the Day of National Unity, a rally and rock concert of the group "Kolovrat" will be held, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the "Russian March-2012"
On the Day of National Unity in 2012, nationalists marched from Yakimansk Embankment to the Central House of Artists, where a rally was held.
The organizers estimated the number of participants at 20 thousand people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure 6 thousand.
Obama campaign staff considered Biden's exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all expected book by Mark Halperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign "Bets Doubled: The Game Changed 2012".
The Times received a copy of the forthcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides conducted “large-scale focus group research and opinion polls in late 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise fading hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to political columnist Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of senior officials of the campaign headquarters and the White House, namely the former head of the administration of the White house Bill Daley, to assess the effect on the vote of the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton Vice President.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago campaign headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daly, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book, Bets Doubled, claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden despite their “close personal relationship,” but eventually abandoned the move when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral roll would not “improve Obama’s chances significantly.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively advocated for a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You have to remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, “Oh my God, what are we supposed to do?”
Although Daly described the study as a “necessary check,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the campaign staff had invested enough in studying whether the move would bring dividends to the vote.
“Election headquarters don’t spend that much money on polls and focus groups unless they’re taking something seriously,” Martin told AK 360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daly if his then-boss knew about the possible shuffling.
Although Daly said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “possibly” Obama knew.
Martin added that “bets doubled” does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political probes reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral roll.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want ice cream in the dark?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first glowing ice cream in the dark with jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific article about jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate a glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that because ice cream starts glowing when it reacts to the warmth of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of ice cream company Lizni me, I’m delicious, says: “It’s an incredible thing, but it’s still at the very beginning, if we talk about production, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2g of substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So when your mouth heats up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to glow.
We’ve been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed ideal to present it at Halloween because it creates such a wonderful glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish luminescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good.
Charlie’s experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of cherry gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
Coach of "Avangard" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavat", said that the Omichi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurgh".
The specialist stressed that "Avant-garde" should pay increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against the Magnitogorsk Metalurg, - quotes the official website of the "Avant-garde" Chebaturkin's words.
- Missed a lot of pucks, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to perform the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks from the move - three pucks scored us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparing for today’s game?
We and the guys carefully analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2-0.
They missed the goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period began to make mistakes.
Given how difficult the game was, I didn’t see the point in connecting the defenders.
Defend the whole team.
Now "Avant-garde" has a long home series, matches go on in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are under the same conditions.
The main thing now is to realize your moments and perform a game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by the Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been in line on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install bio-toilets
Hundreds of trucks piled up at the border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm that the queue is being created by the Russian side, which did not warn about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said the Deputy head of the Eastern customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The checkpoints operate in enhanced mode.
The correspondent of “FACTS” visited the border and talked with truckers who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are increasing every day, as well as the queue from the trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
Customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport destinations from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, before midnight, they were still allowed, and after they introduced these rules, - complains the trucker Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who carries cargo through Russia from Turkey to Kazakhstan and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100-1300 hryvnias).
Those who go near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3,800 hryvnias) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has so much money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries the cargo in the amount of only four thousand dollars, but as far as Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnias) to pay for transit!
The conditions for survival at the border - no, - complain truckers, who have arranged to eat near their cars.
In the border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers orientated themselves and quickly raised them: 15 hryvnia is a bar, seven hryvnia - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
The coffee shop is one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe and go to the toilet.
Not to wash, not to shave...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife on the road prepared everything.
A week long, - comforts another trucker Victor Skotarenko.
Will my car be in line in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in a single border store.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, is the bottle crystal or is the water infused with silver?
We have a cafe, not a store.
Take while there is something else, - the seller mates.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosiev and Novoazov district state administrations were instructed to provide everyone who stands in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said acting Chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergei Dergunov.
Ambulance brigades are now on duty at checkpoints.
For the convenience of people, bio-toilets will also be installed.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31 at the international checkpoints "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk" stood respectively 32 and 68 cars.
“Facts” will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of attempting to defame Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and the Eastern Partnership countries - this statement to the BNS agency was made in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the portal DELFI.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “discuss” Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian Gosarkhiva, which concern the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the Department of analysis of social processes of management of the presidential administration of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who has visited Lithuania several times and participated in the congress of the Lithuanian People's Party.
Also a participant in the operation is allegedly an employee of the department V. Smirnov.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the territory of the country.
On the eve of the Lithuanian President Grybauskaite said that she knows about the upcoming information attack on her.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's desire for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin does not treat Lithuania “sufficiently respectful”.
In addition, Grybauskaite accused the head of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin of making “only demands” to Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
In the United States, the headmaster of the school shot teenagers.
The director of one of the American high schools teenagers literally led to despair.
According to him, the man was forced to take up arms and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans threw toilet paper at the man’s house.
As a result, the school principal opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which several injuries to the leg and arm were sustained by a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with aggravated assault.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
Shooting civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
Just the day before, a man opened fire in the center of the city of Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California right on the street.
After that, the criminal took hostage two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier in the primary school of Newtown, Connecticut, there was a shooting.
Adam's mother worked at school, she was a tutor.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident occurred on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, not to go to bed until late and arrange a masquerade for our area.
Now I look more like a squirrel.
I haven’t had a problem handing out candy in my apartment in the last two years, and I probably won’t this year either.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I look forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year, at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer need to be involved in sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to “The Walking Dead,” and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will get into our Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the costumes most searched for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
That means a lot of funny hotdog dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don’t care.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolates, Lollipops, Milk Duds candies, Twizzlers chewing candies and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million candy-requiring children who are preparing to conquer our neighborhoods.
What’s more, we’ll buy and — let’s not fool ourselves — we’ll eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 35 million pounds of them are sold under Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery that I have yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than a haunted house.
They have stunning titles, such as “The Horror Behind the Walls” (which, incidentally, is in a real prison), “The Whistle and the Scream” and “The House of Shock.”
Moreover, according to the America Haunts Society, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in America, generating about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you almost described yourself, which your friend posted on Facebook and you can not remove, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like “cool facial expression”.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, something we’ve been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately for us, the pumpkin baby fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting out these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which has grown 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want the task more difficult, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and try to cut something out of their pumpkin weighing in 2032 pounds.
The website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense was restored after the attack of Ukrainian hackers
The work of the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyber attack, the press service of the department reports.
According to the Vice-Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense on information and administrative issues, Taimar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a large number of requests.
Our specialists quickly set up everything, so far the site has been restored.
“The damage done to the ministry is minimal,” Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to say who organized the attacks.
“We will certainly analyze the causes of the incident and draw our conclusions from it, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he said.
Recall that on November 1, Anonymous Ukraine posted an appeal on the network, in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Estonian Ministry of Defense and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO’s servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be anyone’s slave.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
“Hands off Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marines of the Feodosiya separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the response forces of NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013.
Due to the riot of impure force had to close several schools and a hospital
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue.
The story of goblins may sound like a child’s invention for a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for closing the school.
Adults are also afraid of impure power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed because of the fact that the medical staff were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the release of the racing series Land Rover
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the car between events.
Drew Bauler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants applying to Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally raid.
“We were very pleased to develop the Defender Challenge car – it’s going to be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to participate in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces know nothing about the group "Brother's Circle" - Novye Izvestia
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After the media reported that the U.S. Treasury Department put Lepsa on the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate ‘Brotherly Circle’, we reviewed all the databases, but did not find such a grouping,” the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to maintaining the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously written “NI”, yesterday the U.S. Department of the Treasury published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brotherly Circle”.
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Greece," posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
Specified the exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative nickname, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another from the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States, we are sure that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for the bandits on their orders.
A photo of the singer is attached to this message and all his data that correspond to reality are indicated.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury entails blocking his assets in the United States and banning business contacts with him persons living in the United States.
Assistant Lepsa Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Gregory, which everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they exist in such cases.
"And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprising and unexpected," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, in Phuket, Gregory Leps does not live, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that now Leps is on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Run on the field in the match "Shinnik"
It became known some details about the personality of the fan who ran on the field during the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak".
According to the head of the Central Committee of the Russian Federation Artur Grigoryants, citing the data of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, this fan is a Muscovite.
He is currently detained.
In addition, Grigoryants told about how the fan managed to break through on the field: "It turned out that this, we will call him a spectator, went to the ambulance accompanied by two spectators, referring to heart problems.
He came to the ambulance, the ambulance doctor confirmed.
And then he pushed away the two escorts and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran across the field.
The stewards are responsible.
Before the entry into force of the law on sports is a zone of action of stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran to the podium, crossed the East Tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the treadmills," the head of the KDC said.
Recall that the decision of the KDC Moscow "Spartacus" will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the championship of Russia against "Locomotive" and "Zenit", as well as pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire crews were called in to rescue a lost puppy who was stranded 50 feet above the ground at a dangerous cesspool in his career
Cocker spaniel Ruby ran away after being in a small accident
Three days later, her, stuck in a career, noticed a man walking a dog
Firefighters came down a rope on a steep slope to save the dog from imminent death
The puppy was lucky enough to escape after being summoned by fire crews to pick him up and take him to a safe place after he somehow got stuck at a height of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, ran away after being involved in a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old friend Becky Hall, were at Flatpit's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were feverishly searching for their missing dog and posting appeals on social media sites after she ran off to a career after a small accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a star dog breeder spotted Ruby stranded at a height of 50 feet on the stage of her career.
A technical rescue team from Clecchiton's fire station rushed to the scene, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carryover to lift her up the slope.
Andy Clayton, a rescue officer, said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of a steep slope — 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move a muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is unbelievable.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said: “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a possibility that she might have suffered a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was found that she was fine, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Mrs. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “To watch for salvation was scary.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had become depressed and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave, what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from Kitley added: “We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she got there.
Mick Jagger Says She Didn't Play With Katy Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a backing vocalist for the 2004 Jagger song Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and noted, "He was flirting with me when I was 18 years old."
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a spokesman for the 70-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he ever struck for Katy Perry."
The representative added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Breaking up with Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition for EU membership.
There are a number of stories about passport control in Berwick and the barbed-wire border along Adrian's Wall.
However, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed to the possible economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules around as conveniently as they can.
As Scotland is now not part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
So this is an unremarkable story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard the “duck” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost in the retelling of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe’s orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the Euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining momentum.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – emerged out of nowhere and won nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (analogue to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the shackles imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself at a pre-disadvantaged disadvantage in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way out is to cut wages and government spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is the deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of a package of green energy measures implemented by Brussels — a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers — European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the United States.
This is paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, there is a riot, especially in France, once the most ardent supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s devastated economy in dire straits.
The result is that Marine Le Pen’s right-wing anti-EU National Front party has just won a crucial additional election, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now France’s most popular party with 24 percent of the vote — a timely warning to British Labour that it cannot be assumed that a split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties get support in this election, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing sentiment against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a vague “Europe of (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle liked.
Germany and several dependent economies may keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left unattended in the Atlantic cold.
In what position does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (essentially) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed under a more free European deal, provided we keep our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is, oddly enough, the most successful political movement in Europe against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to spending cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Treasury Alistair Darling and the resulting coalition of Tories and Liberal Democrats.
Scotland would now be ridiculous to vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Pat Eteridge, a former CNN correspondent, is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be scared if her daughter begins to form breast buds and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents — usually that doesn’t mean the rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, down from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: how to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but is considered "premature", when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – this is something that the pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the age of the child, level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is wary of drugs, but admits that “puberty suppression can mitigate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they’ll handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at age 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first among her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, puberty occurs earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the premise that has the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the terms of puberty.
Other evidence supports this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
There are various explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty appears to affect everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of nursery age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be ashamed to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier than expected conversation,” Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier than they should, this process is a normal part of life.
American Boeing stuck in Chita is preparing for takeoff
The American plane, which conducted observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Wednesday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time, will leave the air harbor of the city.
The management of the airport allowed the departure of the board, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from the airport of Chita.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, they spent two nights at the airport, according to ITAR-TASS.
According to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go beyond the Chita airport, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 States participating.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, and European countries.
The main tasks of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the promotion of monitoring the implementation of arms control agreements, the enhancement of opportunities for crisis prevention and crisis management within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the late celebrities earn - MK in the United States MK
The ranking of the highest-income living celebrities in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was spit out by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
Notably behind him are other deceased celebrities, who last year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "settled" celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the line below the comic book author Peanuts Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow opened the first boutique of Igor Gulyaev
On October 23, the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they will be able to appreciate even more fans of fashion - in Moscow finally opened his first boutique, about which the designer and arranged a party in the style of dolce vita.

I am very happy that I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red ribbon and invited everyone... to try out the models!
Jet manufacturers are at odds over seat width when big orders are at stake
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, a fierce dispute erupted over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers whose interests are not always the focus of the airlines, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for the introduction of an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main US competitor Boeing says airlines should decide this.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in the sales of increasingly larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and the event on November 17-21 is expected to potentially record orders.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft – especially whether 9 or 10 people are seated in a row – is central in statements about the cost-effectiveness of new “mini-aerobus” projects.
Boeing says its updated 777X will hold 406 people, based on economy-class seats over 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class on seats 18 inches wide, arranged 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange blows on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to become the leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the start of a new advertising war could be by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, titled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards for modern long-distance travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of an average 21st-century American man is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health service statistics.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the seat concept of the 1950s, when the average waist circumference of those recently called the “reactive public” was already there.
Airbus says it has ordered a study showing that an extra inch in the seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing has challenged Airbus figures in terms of seat sizes and says manufacturers should not interfere with decisions on how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really all about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s salon specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will bring them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers it is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is a race for orders for planes estimated at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As the Reuters news agency first reported in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20% increase in profitability by one place in their last two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of 10-seater 777X series with the original 9-seater layout of the series of the design solution 777.
Winnings in the specific cost are reduced when compared to the 10-seat layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say salons with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating arrangement that can go hand in hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’s offer is driven by a threat from the 777 model,” said interior designer Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet vendors even carry roulettes with them to test competing layouts.
Praise for comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional cabin modifications, offering wider passageways on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say, her call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “flight” but can distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X.
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine May Deprive Smoking of Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before the start of human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the medical college of Valle Cornell in New York said that the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that this vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome with these modern means,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track down any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine hit.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, who were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine “relaxed” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get that pleasure from the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that more research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in the Moscow region are fully subsidized
Vice-Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are fully subsidized
A total of 187 out of 288 settlements receive subsidies from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 of the 288 settlements received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - 100% subsidies.
Within the framework of budget security, about 25 billion rubles are allocated from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
The vice-governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytisch, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in the Moscow region is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal formations of the Moscow region to consider before the end of November, which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalized by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in Mozhai, Kashir, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Lyubertsy and Kotelnyky there is a request for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in the cities and districts of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow City Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow Region plan to unite in the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidy.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she gets from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina especially devotes a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to mess with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday she pampered the fans, showing how she dressed Artema and Martha on Halloween.
Our first Halloween is ready for the broom races" - this is how Diana called a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, have something to do with this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany is the first country in Europe to introduce an "unspecified gender" in the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to allow hermaphrodite-born children to be labeled “unspecified” instead of male or female.
The child's parents will have the right to leave the gender on the birth certificate unfilled for a period of time.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents can temporarily write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to hurry with the operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be involved in an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption watchdog.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the lease of offshore properties at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three properties on state land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had lobbied several state ministers to extend leases on Sercular Key, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender after their expiration in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of administration, Lynn Ashpoul, on Thursday.
For several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for an open competition.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer lease terms.
In 2009, the contracts for the lease of enterprises on Sercular Key, which brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million per year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, urged changes to the government's lease policy.
The ICAC's decryption of telephone conversations was made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the guidance of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was the issue discussed during these phone calls a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie to Mr. Tripody.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
According to a senior official, Israeli warplanes are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was a Russian-made SA-125 rocket.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out airstrikes on missile shipments inside Syria.
Foreign workers on visas of subclass 457 can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it envisages an expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document, submitted by the government for discussion, was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKeew criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Loud statements like ‘foreigners at the end of the line’ and ‘first jobs for Australians’ represent a very unpleasant reversal to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that needed to be protected — and if some in the region saw echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document, submitted for discussion, outlines 12 measures previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is meeting with officials on human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, with the rest under consideration.
If the “authenticity” criteria are accepted, the visa applicant may be examined for “whether the application is genuine in the circumstances where the applicant is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise”.
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of visas of subclass 457, since previously enterprises intended to sponsor a small number of workers then employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grief-stricken nine-year-old son of the man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player Semen Varlamova Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” she said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk filed a lawsuit for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled her by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her hands, chest, stomach and neck were injured.
Varlamov himself came to Denver police with a confession and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what happened.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of $5,000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but forbade him to approach Vavrynyuk.
He also faces up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of a high-speed connection with Scotland and the north of England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer noted that the project “will unite the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Stage Two is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in rail capacity and reduced travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about transport links between cities; across the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get the best communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unequivocally” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “High-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for high-speed rail across the UK.”
Therefore, we are pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line, which is already being planned by the Scottish government.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with British ministers next year and taking a joint decision on the next steps.
Thorium is the new hope of nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power does not do both, but leaves a lot of expensive waste in the recycling.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste, which must be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to soften the rules relating to these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which required American airlines to do a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that it is considering the statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases are still in place in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently has no specific rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times and passengers to comply with safety rules communicated to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority the expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on board, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s consideration of permitting the use of electronic devices because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it is on our aircraft,” the spokesman said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAA Regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to revise manuals, training materials, standards for carrying hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“Once the airline checks and confirms the resilience of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during boarding.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The head of Dagestan can be heard in the anthem of Kuban notes of extremism
The football match between Anji and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the anthem of Kuban sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday proposed to the republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar region allegedly gives calls for interethnic discord, in particular, calls for war with the "basurmans".
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a shame, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here, as a mother of a native, to the enemy, to the Basurman, we go to the death fight" - why such words should be written in the anthem, poisoning some believers on other believers, - expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov, Parliament Speaker Hizri Shihsaidov.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now, news from across the ocean, namely, from Syria, where, as we have learned today, Israel struck Russian-made missiles reportedly destined for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its production of chemical weapons by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia that allowed the U.S. not to carry out the military operation that it came close to this summer.
More details about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will be told by our chief international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington has said that the Assad regime will be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from the poison gas.
And the punishment came.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal that Assad’s friend, Vladimir Putin, made.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
The longer-term and more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it, it is about a thousand tons.
Washington has said that Assad’s days are numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some people eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a man ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, his mother is unlikely to be relieved that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Assad is holding on.
It changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation created a separate Ministry of Construction and Housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin created a new ministry overseeing construction and housing and proposed to head it to the former governor of the Ivanovo region Mikhail Menu in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men at the residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing are transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of the Region.
Mikhail Men - the son of the famous Orthodox priest Archpriest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergiyevo-Posadskyi district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Moscow Region, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was the governor of the Ivanovo region.
The pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
At a pawnshop in the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays down a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for her daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3,000 ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, her monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore stock exchange.
A jewellery loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above the 15.4% offered in the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require a credit check or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to compensate for declining incomes as their economies slow down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, pointed to an increase in the family's leverage, mainly due to the growth of mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80% of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely emerged from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with prices rising, people in the middle and bottom [of the income scale] will be looking for ways to replenish their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Woon, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the past two years have intensified the rush with which people lay down their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the things laid in the 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, so let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its branches in recent months, up to 20%.
The growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers are laying down items they already own, and monetizing personal assets doesn’t increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means to obtain short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Wealthy people in Singapore also use ValueMax branches by laying down gold bars or Rolex watches, which can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“These include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of available medical institutions and their status that is important for the population, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of medical institutions of our city will create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and pregnant women.
Thus, after the union with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the NGKB for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the material and technical base of the maternity hospital was significantly improved, modern equipment that meets world standards appeared.
Over these years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the overhaul of premises, 112 units of equipment were purchased in the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room during the cesarean section, the device "Cell-Saver" is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and after special treatment to return it to the pregnant woman, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics.
In the women's consultation there is an electronic registry, in the near future it is planned to introduce electronic maps and patient histories.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, pregnant women and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beat and rob 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens arrested by French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the actions of the Caucasians.
The bandits reportedly ordered prostitutes to one of the Strasbourg hotels and then beat and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old formerly convicted Chechen citizen.
Bayern defender David Alaba became Austria’s best athlete in 2013, according to the Bundesliga’s official website.
In this dispute, he was ahead of the representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
Second place went to skier Marcel Hirscher and third place went to ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian helped his team win the Champions League, the championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
Arshavin's ex-wife is resting with actor Andrei Chadov
Ex-civilian wife of football player of St. Petersburg "Zenith" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends a vacation with actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia rests in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhnaya, her fiancé - figure skater Sergei Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Photos from the joint walks of couples published on Instagram Anastasia Zadorozhnaya.
This is not the first joint photo of Andrei and Julia.
On October 5, Zadorozhnaya published a picture of the couple standing hugging on the shores of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, the midfielder "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civilian wife Julia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
Arshavin's new girlfriend was married to the company's top manager.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmania’s health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be supplemented by tough conditions that ensure the state government does not waste money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the island state’s aging population, higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding decision for four years was made after the government's consultation with Tasmania's independent deputy Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a planned Blitz campaign.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics accepting patients without pre-registration, in Hobart and Loneston, to improve the quality of post-hospital care, training medical professionals, mental health services, and the introduction of personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“This investment will go to the ideas put forward by leading physicians on how best to help Tasmania’s healthcare system,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania will work in a mode of strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it spends those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything “unless it is followed by a genuine reform that puts Tasmania’s healthcare system on a more sustainable basis.”
However, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing the state’s health system out of critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But Federal Health Representative Peter Dutton said the statement was “a decision similar to a patch.”
“The reason we’re here is because the state’s Labour government has taken $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government cuts off nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nickle's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts an exceptional staging and historical detail, but it is also harder to perceive than it should be.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760s, tells the grim story of Susanna, a young aristocrat, sent to the monastery by her family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of the sadistic abbot and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to obscenity or sensation – and that’s the problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test of the kind of hairstyle and for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons facilities, says monitoring group
Syria has destroyed major equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, an international monitoring group said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the country’s civil war nearly three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before
The deadline of 1 November is set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all means of producing chemical weapons and mechanisms that allow chemical substances to be mixed with and filled with poisonous gas.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin to destroy its existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons facility as well as its storage sites, according to Britain-based Syrian Center for Human Rights.
A group of activists that tracked the deaths through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of those, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government’s part, the group said 29,954 people are members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 are pro-government militants and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead were 2,202 army defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
The United Nations estimates that 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
This figure has not been updated since then.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s forces have been fighting rebels in Safir for weeks, many of them linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors geared up for their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
The OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it checked and saw destroyed all critical Syrian-claimed production facilities and mixing/refueling equipment.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
The OPCW said on Thursday that both sites were "abandoned and ... chemical weapons items contained in them have been moved to other claimed sites that have been inspected."
It was not immediately possible to find out whether the site in Safir was one of two places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and bravery that you have all shown in carrying out the most difficult mission this organization has ever undertaken,” said Ahmet Uzumju, director general of the monitoring group.
For the third year in a row, the civil war has pitted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, against the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over the verdict against the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the sentence handed down to the last of the conspirators who had been brought to justice and said that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosive devices used during the attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church bombings across Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a man nicknamed “the bomber” for his reputation as a master of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
The decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth mother June Cortine, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost a decade ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing squad,” said Ms. Cort<0xC3><0xAD>n AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have grandchildren anymore and I won’t see my daughters.”
The club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was set in motion in a van parked outside just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “died” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr Hughes said Patek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaa Islamiya terrorist cell responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali to be brought to justice.
He hid for almost a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence evidence showed Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortine.
Until recently, he had no regrets about how much grief he had caused to other people.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but do not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to take place immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their flight crew training manuals and installation rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Depending on the status of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain gives "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is descending for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose planes are properly protected from electronic interference can allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, the FAA said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft, modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at high altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Professional Airliners Association, welcomed these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win,” said Glading.
We are frankly tired of feeling “on duty at school” when it comes to this issue.
But internet connection for surfing, sharing emails, texting or downloading data will still be banned at heights below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the plane of the airline American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device at the time when the plane was at the exit to the landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly all over the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also be banned.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
FAU may lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to examine the issue recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on FAUs to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue there are no compelling reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios - high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruise altitude for several years.
Planes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are adapted to the wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices usually emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on passengers' use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded the entire airliner with their Kindle e-book readers and flew on it to check for problems, but never found them.
Members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of the devices poses any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he considered interference from the devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only individual pilot reports confirming that the devices could create interference for aviation systems, and most of those reports were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices during instrument landings in restricted visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers, who now use many technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to take exams for driving licenses
Driver's license exams will be accepted by private companies with their own computerized circuit.
This writes "Kommersant" with reference to the draft decree of the government "On admission to the management of vehicles".
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia only about 30 such circuits.
It is expected that students of such “privileged” driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Autoinspection will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theory exams and more than 20% of the site students do not pass from the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft government decree enter into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheeled vehicles.
Starting from January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will have to take an exam in urban traffic conditions to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire drivers of foreigners with foreign rights.
Such employees will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
Bird transported by air to a safe place from a drilling rig in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, which was airborne after being found depleted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The water herder was placed in a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, followed by the Scottish branch of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water herdsman is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who got into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It looks like the bird has become debilitated and has been able to find shelter on the oil rig.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were approached for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes wealth and jobs makers in the UK want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sector and region.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside of Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are stagnant.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s entangled institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy issues, from antitrust to product laws, most business leaders believed that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European trade zone, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed with this.
Last but not least, our survey of business executives revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course of treaty change and EU relations based on trade rather than politics.
This result, which has been seen among businesses of all sizes and the largest business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will bring power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving treaty changes and more favourable terms for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in voting to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects that the revision will lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
Better conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone embarks on a path of closer economic and financial integration.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as our survey shows, for businesses this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory performance.
U.S. intelligence services are listening to the personal phone of the Pope
The Vatican’s activities are under the vigilant control of the US intelligence services.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence has been listening to all the talks of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely guarding Pope Francis.
His phone began to be tapped before he became head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also monitored.
What in the United States was given special importance.
The secret service has connected to the cell phones of the cardinals, who gathered in Rome to choose the next Pope.
The telephones of the residence where the members of the conclave lived were also tapped.
American spies tapped all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of a figure undesirable to Washington.
Panorama magazine reported that the "big ear of the United States" continued to intercept the prelates' conversations until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that in the United States since 2005, the Argentine archbishop Bergoglio was designated as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence has also been tracking talks related to the election of the new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives is still working at the U.S. Embassy in Rome, extracting information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American “wiretap”, even if it happens.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the leadership of the United States.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of a snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular - in the free stock exchange photo repository, where this photo is dated to 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop tutorial, published on the Russian website "Megaobzor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in blue-blue scale.
On one side there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other - the view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the Repin St. Petersburg Academy of Arts.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping, but eventually chose snowboarding, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the public opinion about the wide distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But Goznak is not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
Natalia Nikiforova, the head of the press service of the State Snake, told Izvestia that all arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
Snowboarder on the banknote turned to the right, in the photos on the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
The person at the photo shoot to create the bill was shot from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - the characteristic pose of the snowboarder.
She also noted that the copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is quite positive.
Recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - believes the Executive Director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
To prove the 100% similarity of the images on the bill and in photo banks is quite difficult, so lawsuits to challenge intellectual property on this image is unlikely to come.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative banknote of 10 yuan was issued for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.
Russia is committed to upholding this tradition.
Legislation bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian breweries are in a bad mood.
According to their disguises, beer consumption in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Businesses initially expected growth.
After all, this year is bad for them: sales fell by 7%.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Goods of Daily Demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low content of alcohol, - Sheps told listeners.
No country in the world has such a severe restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer lamented that many legislative bans aimed at reducing alcohol abuse do not have much impact, but there are constantly new initiatives.
The most painful among beer producers was the ban on selling alcohol in kiosks introduced this year.
“We immediately lost 35,000 consumers,” said Isaac Sheps.
There are two forecasts for next year’s breweries.
Optimistic - the one about which Sheps spoke: sales of the foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move away from the varieties designed for the mass consumer, to the class of "premium": beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of falling sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level, - said the doctor-narcologist Alexey Sotnikov.
However, the proportion of patients who use strong drink surrogates, as well as those who "sadded" to alcohol-containing tonic drinks like "Jaguar" has increased, while ten years ago it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford Automobile Plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As the unions say, all those fired were compensated.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, there is the question of reducing industrial production in the region.
Deputy of the regional ZakSa Alexey Etmanov at the meeting said that at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the program of voluntary dismissal, which was developed together with the trade union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign voluntarily were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left their jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be the case.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to adopt any programs to support the regional enterprises in a difficult situation," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
Ford does not refute or confirm this information.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will publish it.
Talks about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason at the plant called a drop in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, at the end of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, it will be possible to use mobile during the take-off and landing of the aircraft
New rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, the BBC reports.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will begin to apply by the end of 2013.
However, communication with the Internet for receiving and sending email will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communication will continue to be banned.
Thus, passengers on flights will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of using electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile on aircraft and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, according to the example of the United States, in the United Kingdom, it is also possible to revise the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights.
Under the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally fixed a new name - "Brotherly Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America has been replenished with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli to the “Brotherhood Circle”.
One of the Russians turned out to be the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, there are 22 people on the U.S. blacklist involved in the Brotherhood and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts express doubts that such an organization actually exists.
“The Brotherhood statement is more like an attempt to unite disparate criminal groups,” said organized crime expert and University of New York professor Mark Galeotti.
In his opinion, the “Brotherhood Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who has confirmed the existence of such a criminal organization,” the Center for Corruption and Organized Crime said in a statement.
Mr. Galeotti agrees with Professor Liz Shelley of George Mason University.
"If they act together, it's more like a criminal network, but not an organization," the Center for Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherly Circle” unites more closely the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
Criminal authority was assassinated in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakhariya Kalashova, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandfather Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hasan’s nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals had no relation to Usoiang.
In his opinion, all of them were united rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal over the inclusion of Grigory Leps, the favorite singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin, in the “Brotherly Circle” has attracted the Kremlin’s attention.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why it was included in such lists, - said the press secretary of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today there was a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom Chairman Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute under the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which houses most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe, raises the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom said that construction should begin in other countries, located further along the route of the gas pipeline, by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has learned
Two employees of the YMCA NSW were charged with sexual offences against children prior to filing charges in 2011 against Jonathan Lord, a childcare worker in Karingbach, the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children reported.
But the commission’s introductory statement said it had “never dealt with cases of child sexual abuse within its organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about one case where a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case where a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual offences against children under his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gale Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew of the first case but did not know of the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also made inaccuracies in the Commission’s introductory speech, claiming that “there were external YMCA checks that acknowledged that the YMCA was at the forefront of child safety.”
The testimonials provided by the commission indicate that the YMCA has been notified that it has received the second out of four possible assessments based on the results of a quality audit performed by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower management had failed to hire the Lord and had not been able to ensure that staff clearly understood their obligations regarding reporting violations of child safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys during his two years at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of child safety.
The officers testified that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Oakwell, who was under Lord's leadership and asked to teach her to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she found Jackie Barnat, the child custody manager of the YMCA's Karingbach branch, who was Lord's supervisor, "very intimidating and often difficult to reach."
The Executive Director said he did not accept staff explanations that it was embarrassing for them to report the situation to their senior executives.
Rather, he said, their friendship with the Lord led them away from the idea of having to report him.
Mr. Hare said that he had presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from the “Accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “relating to the provision of information” by employees, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the allegations appeared was made by YMCA’s director general for child custody Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the damage of evidence, but at the same time “exaggerated” and this decision was poorly implemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a child-friendly organization while Jonathan Lord was working in it between 2009 and 2011, according to the commission’s expert on child abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and controlling staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
At home, she is considered not just a model, but a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bündschen left her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, these days and this week she came to the defile on purpose.
Many months of absence did not prevent her to keep her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle is the highest paid supermodel in the world.
This time she was involved in the Kolcci brand.
The finale of Fashion Week is usually the most interesting shows.
Like the stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of luxury pret-a-porte, the designer is actively working in the theater and cinema, decorating performances and designing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world took part in the final week of fashion in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing areas of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual turnover reaches 50 billion dollars.
Tony Blair said he would seize the chance to return as Britain’s prime minister, but acknowledged that a return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic politics.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador to the Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would return to the post of prime minister, Blair said, according to London's Evening Standard, "Yes, of course, but it's unlikely to happen, so ..."
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the result of no one in the match of the 10th round of the championship of Italy with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of the leading players.
I am very sorry that we failed to win,” Tmw quoted Allegri as saying.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let Lazio do anything.
In the second Romans added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
We should have won.
“Last season we did the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are lagging behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players with character.
However, our composition is still good.
Look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Equestrian experts coming to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year prize knew that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before taking his first steps, this baby with his pet Shetland pony Toffee lynx rushed through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple – the same height – received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnybank equestrian center in the city of Radry near Cardiff.
Coming out to the general public against the background of men and women in elegant hats, he moved his cap on the back and proudly walked around the circle of two-year-old Toffee.
The judges praised Fenton for his poorly developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffee got the highest score for appearance and character.
Fenton was given to Toffee on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been practicing Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffee make up a beautiful duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a golden cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Abb Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said: “The whole audience was amazed, and everyone shouted approving shouts and clapped.”
He ran across the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chicks he cares about.
Judging by how he started, he will soon be taking part in Horse of the Year – and I’m sure he will perform well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges praised Fenton and Toffee for their appearance and how they portrayed themselves in the show ring.
They assess the consistency of the performance of the pony and the breeder - Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I am sure that Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper published a call “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the accused in defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, according to the regulator of the press.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express issued an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with state ownership.
Now the “New Express” has to go through the “process of full correction of errors”, as reported by the regulator.
The order to “correct errors” came from the Guangdong Department of Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group’s New Express newspaper published several false reports about Zoomlion, a listed company, between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial board of the New Express was disoriented," the regulator said in a statement.
He said it was decided to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the withdrawal of his reporter’s license.”
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to fully correct the New Express’s mistakes and recommended that it investigate the newspaper’s situation-related officials and make immediate changes to the New Express’ leadership.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published on the front page two calls for his release, saying that it supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television acknowledging that he had published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confessions, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of knocking out confessions in China is still widespread, despite recent amendments to laws that prohibit authorities from forcing anyone to self-declare.
U.S.-Mexico Tunnel Discovered for Drug Trafficking, Equipped with Own Railway
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail system.
The U.S. authorities described the four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages they have ever discovered.
This zigzag tunnel, which is almost six football fields long, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transported through it, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
The three men, who were said to have worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
If convicted, they face prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which set drug cartels the difficult task of quickly delivering their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that went from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Pensions increased in Belarus since November
In Belarus, since November this year, pensions have been increasing, BelTA correspondent in the main department of pensions of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection has been informed.
From November 1, this year, the adjustment of the average salary of workers in the republic, applied at the previous recalculation of pensions, with an increase in its value by 5.4% will be carried out and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 478 "About increase of pensions".
As a result of the recalculation from November, working pensions by age will increase, according to an estimate, by an average of 5.3%.
The average retirement pension will be Br2 million 295 thousand.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenditures of the Social Protection Fund of the population of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection of Belarus for the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labour pensions in November this year, the minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplementary pensions will be recalculated in connection with the increase in the budget of the subsistence minimum on average per capita.
BPM for the period from November 1, 2013 to January 31, 2014 was approved by the government in the amount of Br1 million 47 thousand 530 - by 2.1% higher than in the period from August 1 to October 31.
Accordingly, from November 1, the amount of minimum labor pensions, social pensions and allowances, raises and supplementary pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus, more than Br53 trillion were pledged to pay pensions, taking into account the increases in 2013.-0-
British police hand over extradition notice to Assange
British police handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and asked for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had handed the 40-year-old Australian a “formal surrender request” to the police station, adding that if he failed to comply, he would continue to be subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sexual offences after he ran out of options under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
“Scotland Yard handed the 40-year-old man an official surrender request, which obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” the spokesman said.
He still violates the terms of bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the police notice.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible espionage charges following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
A driver who drove at a speed of 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1000
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howe of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to take between his legs.
In Colchester's court of justice, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver's license resulted in a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional <0xC2><0xA3>100 to help crime victims.
Tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has made a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced a 7% state duty rate in the 2012 budget for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own homes in a partnership rather than as individuals.
Currently, the state duty on residential property in the areas of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 fiscal year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, the northwest, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in state duties on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is undervalued regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system.”
“But this move could lead some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The cost of first-class real estate — the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price — in London’s rich southwestern belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were eclipsed by the actively developing “home market” with price spikes in the south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wind their tail to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs wave their tail mainly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the canine family may notice these subtle differences in howling their tails and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people’s left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at it in other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs have the right side of the brain that controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the versatile tailings of other dogs, researchers watched the animals when they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
It is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs videos of dogs — either naturalistic versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and steer the tail more left or right.”
When the animals saw that the otherwise non-expressive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the waving tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was leaning mostly to the left (again from the point of view of the waving tail of the dog), their heartbeat increased and they seemed alarmed.
Professor Vallortigara said that he does not think that dogs intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience about which movements they should worry about and which they should not.
He observes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs and often their tail is one way associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their animal’s emotions.
Dog Behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the University of Bristol Veterinary School, said it was not the first study to test whether the left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a satisfied dog.
In another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the wagging of its tail was directed to the left instead of the right, instead of becoming alarmed — the opposite of the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be helpful to study how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is ample evidence for different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details remain to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it is likely that we will soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a concert in Glasgow after its vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was due to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, vocalist Alex Turner's illness forced them to postpone the show.
The group’s statement came after it was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After deciding to move the show to Birmingham’s LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical help, Arctic Monkeys are also due to postpone the show at Hydro’s site in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
"Alex Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and unfortunately he is unable to perform."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets for this show are valid.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience that this has caused them.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals to the Catholic Church for the first time in his lifetime on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the popes, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of the group of 120 "electoral cardinals".
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a meeting of all current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held ahead of the inauguration ceremony.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a Consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors is likely to decline by February.
He said the pope usually names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of electorate cardinals back to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see whether the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, there are forty percent of Catholics, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first cardinals elected since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with seeking ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided it all on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was “quite possible” that Francis would appeal to the cardinals for advice.
But we haven’t been in this situation before – it’s all for the first time.
Valero said that popes were usually raised to the post of cardinal bishops from large parishes, but Francis “is full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the United States to refinish the back of the seats
General Motors Co. is recalling nearly 19,000 all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address manual tilt adjustment issues, according to a notice from U.S. vehicle safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism of the back.
As a result, seat backs do not meet federal vehicle safety standards on head restraints.
“When a car hits the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said in a notice posted on its website.
The recall models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM’s pickup truck launch began in June and represents the most important mass-produced vehicle launch for a leading U.S. automaker since it was restructured due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the pickup trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was unable to consider a notice to owners in connection with a 16-day government shutdown that cut car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose by about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The Desperation of Obama Voters
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing hope for change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to nullify commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the website of Obama-reformed health care system, drone attack
Obama's 2008 campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard University.
I read a sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me in times of despondency in the second year of medical school and revive a sense of hope in me.
It’s called “Audacity to Win,” and it’s a memoir about Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics has inspired millions of people and speeches have been breathtaking.
The election victory was impressive, and news anchors paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was supposed to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, his support rate was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a crude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism — they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and diverse achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, and the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health, and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base, among others.
But after countless times I’ve sided with the Obama administration, defending it against colleagues and peers, I’ve run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republican obstructionism cannot account for allowing foreign leaders to eavesdrop or drone strikes on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the National Security Agency’s collection of data on Americans’ privacy or the prosecution of whistleblowers who expose government misconduct.
He cannot explain the killing of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with government funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently, it has been unable to justify failing to develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Should I have understood, at the age of 18, that leadership may be at odds with the political campaigns that precede it?
It is obvious that working in an elected position is not a predictable program of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and such random events as the Newtown massacre.
Nevertheless, all of the examples I have listed above show that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, he seemed unable to make a decision on his own politics or views.
I believed that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would justify the hopes that we have heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating fell below 45% this week, it became much more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me miss many of the promises that have flown away.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a deafening defeat on Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to return our attractiveness,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.”
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.

Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved dispute over a $6 million carbon tax, made the statement while he was trying to shake off questions about whether he has a conflict.
The United Palmer Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in deciding to abolish taxes on carbon emissions and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they get a leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner of the contest for a seat from the Sunshine Coast of the Fairfax constituency with a preponderance of 53 votes after the recount.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision be made two months after we voted?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have such a system to come in, enter our data into the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 6:30 p.m. that same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
To use a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for Sunshine Coast and he would be “very serious” about his new job.
Public office implies service to society.
“We are not seeking any rewards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global regulators’ check of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $ 5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in an ongoing investigation that echoes the LIBOR interbank rate manipulation scandal.
Refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from regulators this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, informed individuals said that RBS transferred the email and instant messaging records it received and sent from its former trader to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Usher, resigned from RBS in 2010 and, as far as is known, was granted a leave of absence from his current position as head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any violations.
Mr. Asher’s instant messaging group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
UBS said this week it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers colluded to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, the person familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been looking through instant messages and emails for several years in search of offences.
News of the inspections sparked traders in the field of activity, which in recent years was one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the seriousness of the situation by saying that a vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market is almost impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price.”
The news came on the same day Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of its stock traders from the London Stock Exchange this week after it caused nearly $6 million in losses at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health care law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
By voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that separate orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine were constitutional under the government’s tax authority.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined four more liberal members of the court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-page law and further ruled that the requirement by the Health Care Act that states increase Medicaid compliance, otherwise they would lose all federal Medicaid funding, is not unconstitutionally coercive.
The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
Against the law strongly opposed each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Football - the reason for the differences?
In the State Duma, as part of the Open Tribune, politicians and experts talked about how to preserve national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals sounded like this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because of this game - only scandals and differences.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that to reduce the "degree of tension in society" politics and the media should be correct in their statements.
Probably, he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate.
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev - "a model conflict that could be predicted", but "for these questions we have too many people and authorities" and seven nannies have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, according to the public, has failed, and it is necessary to look for a way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new unified textbook of history.
"It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what people live in Dagestan for, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal responsibility for "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If the United States says on the radio that it is necessary to give Alaska to Russia, you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "burn".
As usual, he accused journalists who bring the sick and acute national problems to a public discussion: "There is little to say in the heat of controversy!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasiliev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to hold talks on this topic carefully, and then the same obligations can be assumed by politicians.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order as a whole is established, Mr. Vasiliev said.
As an example, he cited a law that places regional and municipal authorities in charge of inter-ethnic peace in their territories.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: it does not have "clear ideas about what the adaptation of migrants is, about its mechanisms and limits.
So, the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, municipalities do not have the staff necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no funds, and the center does not give them methodological recommendations that they could use.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Hajimet Safaraliyev proposed to create a special department with the formidable name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 1990s headed a similar department, which was later abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a “minister without a portfolio”, to whom one could turn, if anything.
"We are walking along the edge, shells are tearing apart, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to stand together against provocations, and this work should receive worthy information support," said the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church on relations with society Vsevolod Chaplin.
There should be no neutrality of the state towards dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, in his opinion.
Here Oleg Nilov took the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, we still need to look for, but they are pushed to the wrong path, the wrong path," he said.
"The wrong road" is the development of football: "The football player is beaten by the whole crowd, the flags are burned, the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football.
There is another sport called rugby.
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" - said <0xD0><0xBF><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xBE><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81>.
In rugby in the Caucasus no one will play! - immediately intervened Mr. Zhirinovsky.
You will offer them curling!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is like offering the Georgian “Zaporozhets”...
In Yaroslavl wild behavior on the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football should be banned all over the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, Artur Grigoryants, said that “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the House of football correspondent “SE” Philip Papenkov.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for the burning of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during the home match of the 14th round against Anzha.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the wrongful behavior of the audience "Kuban" fined 500 thousand rubles.
Google, Samsung, Huawei filed patent lawsuits against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, which it cut off at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s $4.5 billion patents, filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match online search keywords with relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the backbone of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not available and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running Google’s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
Losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in this transaction the determining factor was partly the Motorola patent library.
“Despite a failed attempt to auction off the patents that are the subject of the lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is demanding increased damages from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
Egypt's first freely elected president sworn in
Morsi is sworn in, but his day of celebration is unlikely to mark the end of Egypt’s political struggle.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that for most of its 84 years has been a banned organization that has served as a target for the hard-hitting actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police when Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential pump, the traffic was halted only for a short time to pass his convoy on a normally busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “spare wheel” by the Brothers, his personal prestige has risen sharply since his victory and Friday’s speech, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi said, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, to judges in a wood-paneled hall where he was sworn in.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood at the stand "smilefully".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan “Army and people – one hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took the symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year began, and vowed to return the powers of the president, which his office was stripped of by a military council that took matters from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath in front of a court rather than before parliament as is customary, he is fulfilling the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Another meeting of the Association of Mechanical Engineers of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electrically welded steel pipes was held.
According to the commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted to study the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrically welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for their production on it.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new stand was launched, which allows to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for tep-personal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will make up about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The enterprise is undergoing retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new longitudinal steel cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of products, as well as another mill, with a pipe production rate of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in the housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task to close up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also aimed at forms of state support for industry, which include reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of leasing it.
This year it is planned to allocate 150 million rubles for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy contracts, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Up to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex, are reduced.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will cease, since the motive for its introduction was to compensate for the tax on mining, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do this and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region prioritizes direct support for industrial enterprises rather than financing the oil industry through them.
The budget assistance will be related to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the evolving situation with oil companies.
The subsidy on the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage for the industry in the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle band of Russia, where cheaper labor.
In addition, the question of the succession of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders at the Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvata project expires in 2013, and no application for its extension has been received.
Currently, the southern enterprises of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for the next year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvatsky district will be paid to the region’s budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomich will work 240 hours for an extremist video in social networks
The Leninsky District Court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of mandatory work of a city resident who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page on the popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was opened against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliation of human dignity committed in public".
"The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special order and found the man guilty of the above-mentioned crime, imposing a penalty in the form of 240 hours of mandatory work," the interlocutor of the agency said.
She added that the man had fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Nikolay Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Area provision, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This will also mean that prices will fall.
"This is about goods that come from EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
However, there should also be no price increases.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which have recently appeared quite a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite so, or, to be more precise, it is not at all so, "Azarov summed up.
Investigators verify information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a report that the teacher of one of the kindergartens of the city of Biysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
At present, the investigators find out all the circumstances, as well as give a legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten employees.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgeny Vasilyeva spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyeva, to whom the media has been paying close attention for almost a year, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about thefts in the Ministry of Defense, and about her personally - relations with the former defense minister Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and her addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of "Oboronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilieva said: "Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to pull out from me any negative information about the former defense minister."
There was blackmail about me having to testify, or I'm going to jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% sure of victory.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, most of all, Vasilyev was struck by the words that she does not matter with taste.
Probably, we mean the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant of the case "Oboronservis", found fakes.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the owner, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art examination, appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings, found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap fakes,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I was bad with taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it's just indiscretion," Vasilyeva says.
When asked if she admitted her guilt in at least one of the 12 criminal episodes attributed to her, Vasilyeva said: “Of course not.
There is nothing to admit at all.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasiliev is evading the study of the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer said that he and his client "does not allow the investigator to get acquainted with the materials of the case."
What caused the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps, as a woman, she could not fail to respond to the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of “Komsomolka” right, who claimed a couple of days ago that she “fell into even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news about the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family?
Victor Baranets, a well-known KP military columnist, wrote in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?": "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative at interrogations."
Previously, Vasilyeva some accusations of illegal sale of real estate of the Ministry of Defense took over.

Do you think travel agents have gone into the past thanks to the Internet?
In the company Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year profit forecast and expects record earnings from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its main full-year pre-tax profit to be $325 million to $340 million, up from its previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, it will be a 12-17% increase from a record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre made 8% of its first-half profit and started the second half with good performance, especially on week trips to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits for our 10 countries, and for some of them, a record high profit is expected for the full year before deduction of interest and tax contributions,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, leisure business has recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a somewhat weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure business was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her business in the U.S. has compensated for losses suffered during the seasonally weak first half, and is expected to make a profit for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
On October 31, the Barnaul police identified two game halls.

In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who brutally dealt with two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
According to the press service of the GU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirov district of the Ural capital, after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya street, the bodies of two women with signs of violent death were found.
The identities of the dead were soon identified.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg for 44 years, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the burned-out apartment a few days ago.
His investigation took personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are working on different versions of the murder, checking the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the women rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained relations.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature “non-program texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate language final exam, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major subjects next year.
A separate regulatory body in the field of OFQUAL exams will present a revised structure of high school final exams, with a new system of assessments and a smaller volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public confidence,” insisting that school graduation exams would be “more challenging, more ambitious, and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, pupils work about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation math exams combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional training in the subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2 200 rubles
From tomorrow, tourists from Blagoveshchensk to Heihe will begin to carry ships on an airbag.
For those who want to go to China, this means additional costs.
A ticket for a cougar traditionally costs much more than for a heater.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of a regular ticket will be 2 200 rubles.
The passage through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2 800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not rise in price: at the same price pumas drove tourists and last spring, and a year ago - in the fall.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that Russia’s GDP growth rate is insufficient and believes that the situation can be improved by simplifying the terms of business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation.
We have planned for GDP growth of around 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of a recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be a higher pace.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business get normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

A trip through mud, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking in hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country — only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 main characters of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him CNN’s Hero of the Year.
This man will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and relapse into unconsciousness, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had a broken arm, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that reminded him of himself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving whatever treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwell said.
“You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of health care spending is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes weekend trips to the countryside to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are stuffed into vans, tied to rooftops, and driven across the countryside to visit the village in need of help.
They don’t always have luck.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they are greeted like real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that the locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages really is the reason for the holiday, and Bwelle with his wide smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates — documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, municipality, or house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitation equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an impassioned pace, but the brigade’s dedication usually helps support village musicians.
“They beat the drums all night so we can stay awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, conducted 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can be of immense importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” he said.
In addition to these weekend clinical admissions and hospital work, surgeon Bwelle also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in Bwell’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses like O’Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe to join Bwell in his quest, it’s an opportunity to practice that they would never get at home.
“We were given the opportunity to assist in surgeries where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwell,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never get that opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their own travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medication.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their food, transportation, and training are paid for by Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill the promise given to his father, is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see what you can do to help.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel's wiretapping
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the conversation, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Prosecutor General’s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by US special services.
Snowden said he was willing to testify.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear,” said Hans-Christian Ströbele, “that he knows a great deal.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly determine all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spyware.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday that imposes additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. electronic intelligence agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus Vladimir Makei at a press conference following the meeting with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, BelTA correspondent reports.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we agreed that the public administration bodies of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts with each other," Makei said.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus will create all the necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also said that another 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, following which the protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a roadmap for Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, is aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation in the trade, economic and investment spheres, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, as well as the search for new forms and directions of cooperation.
"The protocol of the last meeting has been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that at the talks, the foreign ministers of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade turnover between Belarus and Turkey, according to the Minister, should be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the field of investment cooperation, which must be further developed, since there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There have always been very warm relations between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
All necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic relations and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey,” said Ahmet Davutoglu.
Obama refuses to say anything about health care
Amid the storm of criticism, President Obama went to the brink yesterday regarding his often repeated, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receive notices of service cuts from their providers, Republicans have in recent days criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama rigged his initial public promise somewhat.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called a "news boost" to the cessation of services, Obama urged the Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You’ll get better terms,” he said.
The administration said it should not be surprising that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required by the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me say directly to these Americans: you deserve better,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been “terrifyingly bad” since October.
“I’m just as upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I really want to restore your trust.”
Annoyed, Sibelius overturned that phrase, caught by a microphone behind her at a House hearing yesterday after a heated debate with House Speaker Billy Long, a Missouri Republican, about whether she was obligated to join Obama’s health program herself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to explain why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
The Agency "Rosbalt" was deprived of the status of the media for obscene fighting
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license on the registration of the agency "Rosbalt", - writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status - for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representative offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has been developing and operating as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private online media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency’s exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the closeness of the publication to the law enforcement agencies continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions, it was also said that Natalia Chaplina, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplin’s role in Rosbalt’s leadership is not entirely clear: she is often called the “project manager”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the ranking of the attendance of Russian media sites according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin's helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Shout", the pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The Rosbalt conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, prohibiting journalists from obscene warfare.
The agency found the forbidden vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot desecrated oil towers").
The following pages are described differently.
Roskomnadzor, on the basis of the detected video materials, accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to take away the license from the agency.
Rosbalt stated that the claims of the department are illegal: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, secondly, the native words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims in the peace court – and when on October 22, 2013, the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, the consideration of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, on the 25th day, the world judge made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court – if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of the status of the media.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt was left alone during this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the Communist Party of Russia).
The head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights Mikhail Fedotov stated about the illegality of the closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that the case will not come to the withdrawal of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria destroys chemical weapons equipment
Syria has destroyed all declared chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus one day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria had to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisonous substances for use, the BBC reports.
The destruction of the stockpiles of poisonous substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the poisonous substances are currently in sealed storage.
International inspectors travelled to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on Aug. 21 on the outskirts of Damascus, according to the United States.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of poisonous substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence services.
They will be happy to advise the inspectors of new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded from the Syrian leadership – in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia – to destroy or put out of service all the facilities for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has been completed, the next step should be the destruction of chemical weapons already in place in the Syrian army.
It is estimated that this arsenal could contain more than 1,000 tons of nerve agents, skin-damaged mustard gas and other banned chemicals stored in dozens of different locations.
For its destruction, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable for action - it takes two weeks.
OPCW field operations chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors had “personally observed the destruction of the equipment.”
“They are no longer in a position to continue producing or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
The OPCW said in a statement that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and made sure that the factories for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or rendered unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “especially difficult” as it had to work in the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW won the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said there was no time to celebrate the inspectors — they were too busy.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far”
John Kerry demonstrated the easing of U.S. surveillance tactics by making an unprecedented admission that in some cases, U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far.”
The secretary of state also pleaded guilty, along with Barack Obama, to being “on autopilot” during Edward Snowden’s high-profile revelations of NSA espionage.
These leaks have put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some of the things happening on autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed – both during World War II and during the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, on September 11.”
He then became the first senior U.S. government member to admit that U.S. espionage went too far, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone unreasonably far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there are no abuses against innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted with good intentions and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We were actually preventing plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to learn about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will head to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the U.S., the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs chair said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he spoke with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations due to frustration over surveillance conducted by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain our supporters in our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who is in his first term as chairman of the Senate’s Subcommittee on International Relations for European Affairs.
“And I’m going to Europe to make it clear to them that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the agency’s head said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden, indicating that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage against allies as necessary and said it was common on both sides.
Against this backdrop, Murphy said his office is organising a trip for members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes the delegation will include members of both parties and both houses.
The names of the other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still in the development stage.
Although Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to help improve relations, he said some degree of “best-intentioned toughness” would also be manifested.
He said European leaders should be honest with their people about what spying programs they have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to agree with the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address hostility to U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of public observation commissions will increase the influence of prison officers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of public observation commissions (PECs) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
UNC - public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozjaev, the unrest in the Copeian colony - it is through the ONK that most of the resonant incidents behind bars are made public.
There is a struggle between human rights defenders and security lobbyists for control of the ONK.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the NPC, I proposed to make the experience of human rights activities a criterion for selection.
"He was not accepted, and they formed lists without elaborating criteria," says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
As a deputy of the State Duma from Apple, he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONK.
The OP Council must vote for the compositions of the NPCs in 43 regions of the country.
There are less than 1,000 candidates for 1800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a pre-recruitment for vacant places.
The ONC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that in the new composition instead of 20 there will be 40 participants.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital’s commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the ballot in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
But the representative of the "Battle Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, appointing their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by the member of the ONK Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization defending the interests of law enforcement agencies.
"I don't eat babies on the bench," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested oppositionists.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in which list is currently being voted in the OP.
He considers the disclosure of Borshchev’s information a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders - the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk ONK.
Its former leaders will be removed due to last year's cop riots.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the ONK Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
The human rights defender-chairman of the local commission “missed” from the new lists, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers “revenge for Kopeysk”.
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the ONC of Mordovia, which is considered "forceful": only one human rights defender wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
OP Council member Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He forwarded his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for it because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The drafting of the ONC lists was coordinated by Vladislav Grib, Deputy Secretary of the OP, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the FSIN.
Grib told RBC daily that he does not consider it correct to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough powers to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom does not dare to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, the amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian woman appeals against jail term in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket island for falsely claiming to have been attacked by a taxi driver appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by the Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of filing a false claim after Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, CCTV footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police questioned Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at a detention center for general detainees on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than at an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about her daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously it was an alarming time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence by up to two years and forcing her to serve an adult prison sentence.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its eroded tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltysheva", translated into French.
It was this novel that became the finalist of four awards: “Clear meadow”, “Russian Booker”, “National bestseller” and “Great book”.
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is the undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, based on modern life stories and stories causes heated debates among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the collected articles on the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, we are talking mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow to include most of the articles and reviews from regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the sections "Paragraphs..."
