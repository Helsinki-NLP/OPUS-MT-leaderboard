Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech: Transfer at the last minute?
Everything is possible
Today is the last day you can still jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
Another chance will come in the winter.
Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, currently Chelsea’s substitute goalkeeper, does not sit on a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits in the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov NH Hotel, talks with Czech journalists and is preparing with the Czech national team for a game general with the Americans and, subsequently, for a sharp start of qualifying for Euro 2016 against the Netherlands.
Thibaut Courtois wins the Premier League title for the first time in ten years at the London club.
It has been speculated that Real Madrid might be interested in the Czech Republic.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup to Atlético at the start of the season and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He finished the French league season with two wins and two draws, shooting St. Etienne 5-0 on Sunday.
The most popular shoe is the AS Monaco.
He has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league so far and at the weekend broke with Lille amicably 1-1.
On the English tabloid websites, there were reports today that they might want a Czech in Queens Park Rangers.
According to English bookmakers, however, Chekhov’s departure from Chelsea at the last minute is not very likely.
Skybet posted a 4-1 odds on him.
Peter, is it possible that you will change your jersey in the next few hours?
I don’t think so, but there’s never anything 100% in football.
Perhaps during the day there will be an offer that will not be rejected.
What would such an offer look like?
(laughs) "Well, I still don't know what an offer that can't be rejected actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on Chelsea's position whether or not the club would handle any offer.
Is it technically feasible to make such a transfer while you are in Prague?
Wouldn't it be necessary for you to sign a new contract somewhere in your new field of work?
I didn't think about it.
But in such a situation there are a lot of players today, everyone is somewhere at the national meetings and I am sure that a lot of transfers will be closed today.
So somehow it would be feasible.
How many clubs are there on the planet that can afford you?
Well, I really don't know.
So you're not pushing to leave?
The situation when I did not catch in the first three matches of the new season is new for me after 15 years of my career.
However, there is no reason to panic, pack up and go somewhere.
I want to continue to participate in this fight for the position of Chelsea goalkeeper and it is up to the coach to choose who will make the decisions in the coming weeks.
What role does your family play in your decision-making?
I take all the factors into account.
Of course, the sporting aspect is important to me, but I also look at it from the personal side, to which the needs of the family belong, of course.
Is it possible that you would catch another club in England?
That's a question that I thought would never concern me.
In football, anything is possible.
I don't want to rule anything out.
I don't know the answer.
Prime Ministers of India and Japan meet in Tokyo
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo to meet with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe to discuss economic and security commitments for his first major visit since May's election victory.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to cement economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
In the first place, the list includes plans for greater cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to the report, India also hopes that the two nations will agree to cooperate on defense issues.
Police in Karratha arrest 20-year-old man after motorcycle chase
The motorbike was stopped after a zone with a maximum speed of 70 km/h rushed 125 km/h and drove into the bush to escape the police.
In the morning in Karratha, the traffic police tried to stop the blue bike at the extreme when they noticed that it was 125 km/h at the exit from the gas station on Bathgate Road.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued along Burgess Road and then turned into a bush, so the police lost him out of sight.
The motorcycle and the person who corresponded to the description of the driver were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karratha police have accused the 20-year-old of disobeying calls to stop and reckless driving.
He will appear in court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be tried on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was briefed on the charges during a High Court hearing in Glasgow.
On June 7, 2013, he allegedly raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
Webster allegedly attacked her while "she was unconscious, asleep and unable to give her consent."
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set a hearing date for November 17 at the Edinburgh Supreme Court.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are also human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis proposed a law to protect trade union organization as a civil right.
“Depending on how unions work, middle-class jobs work,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democratic senator who co-chairs the Congressional Committee.
That is why I am so proud to present a law strengthening the position of employees, along with John Lewis's model of occasional rights.
This groundbreaking legislation will give workers the same legal options to prevent discrimination in trade union organisation as other forms of discrimination - and stop anti-competitive forces
Adjusting the Employment Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination to join unions, to sue in a civil court - and to prosecute compensation or damages - is the right and necessary initiative.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other lawmakers are proposing in the law is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states - Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, extend and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country in one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assemble.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that Hideki Toya’s military autocracy would be replaced by democracy.
They believed that employees and their unions were playing a role in shaping the new Japan, including language and openly acknowledging that “the right of employees to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans, realizing that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, included a clause that openly stated: “The right to create associations that will secure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or profession.
Arrangements that will restrict or seek to damage this right will be revoked. Measures leading to the fulfillment of such purpose are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide treaty in 1948, the petitioners and Roosevelt included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form and join unions in the protection of his interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to create a civil and democratic society, the Americans explained that the right to form labor unions - and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners - must be protected.
Now that these rights are being challenged in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and assert themselves in a free and open society.
As Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the trade unions did not reduce the strength of the nation, but expanded it.
They have raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unforeseen level.
Those who attack unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History does not forget, and neither should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights so as to prevent discrimination in the organisation of trade unions - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that raised America and made it a true promise of democracy.
Judge Temporarily Blocks Law That Could Shut Down All Abortion Clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a Louisiana law that lawyers said would likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
The decree, signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and due to enter into force on September 1, would require abortion doctors to have the right to receive a patient in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge's ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and in the meantime must obtain this permission.
“The proposed party will be able to legally conduct its activities and, in the meantime, obtain a permit,” Federal Judge John deGravelles said in a ruling.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent resolution on the law.
Activists for abortion rights welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, and said it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures that women in Louisiana are safe from the insidious law that is supposed to deprive them of their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of three out of five clinics.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also applied to doctors from two clinics who were not among the plaintiffs and also applied for this authorisation.
Louisiana is among the 11 states that have passed similar laws, with the Alabama and Mississippi courts declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law that would shut down most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women’s rights to abortion, together with the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permission imposes medical requirements that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion argued that the measures were intended to protect women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, only one doctor in Louisiana is allowed to perform abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure out of fear for his safety, the group said.
Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for the application to be granted rights.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James released a video celebrating their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in the Australian countryside are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their counterparts in the city.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% lived five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Down Lung and Ovarian Cancer
Researchers followed women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival affected the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rates occurred in older women whose cancer was diagnosed at an advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20% more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die of ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan argues that factors may be late diagnosis and poor treatment availability.
"The disease is best treated by gynecologists, who usually live in larger cities," she said.
Despite improving long-distance medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are being treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and prevention programs.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret the decrease in the number of homeowners
According to an HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline of homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that when today’s young generation of consumers reaches “the main age group of gardeners,” garden centers will lose up to ten million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent homes spend an average of 55% of the amount that people living in their own gardens.
Other factors threatening the industry, which earns an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion a year, include the increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of pavement instead of front gardens used as a parking lot, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of owned homes fell over six years from 61% to 43%, one household accounts for the lowest spending on horticultural products in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society said that living in a sublet or lack of space does not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor for RHS, said: “Tenants are very popular with growing plants in pots – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the "golden age" of the horticultural retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales for this year due to better weather, which came after adverse conditions in March and April.
When an Eastern dictator preaches about democracy.
After Putin, at the meeting of his youth organization, which reminds me most of the Hitler Youth, resurrected with atomic weapons and basically showed everyone that their views were stolen from him, he gave us a lecture on democracy today.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia has many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both fierce nationalism and the fact that the inferiority complex can be transformed into imperialist desires.
Time seems to flow differently in the east than in the west.
While the Western world thought that the time of wars over European domination was long gone, in the East it thinks that they have been overlooked for a long time and that it is necessary to regain its international position.
Such a mood and frustration reigned in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazis seized power, and then followed an explosion of nationalism unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the beating of journalists, the elimination of inconvenient political opponents, the discrimination of minorities and homosexuals, that is indeed quite similar.
Vladimir Putin, and certainly a large part of the Russians, probably misses the time when Russia ruled half the world and the other part trembled before them.
Maybe Western politicians blamed themselves, maybe they didn’t pat Vladimir on the shoulders, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted to go, and maybe they started to underestimate him, and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made order at home, pretending he didn't really want to go anywhere, and grinding knives at home.
Now he decided to take back his lost positions.
Starts slowly, has time.
He's probably a lifelong leader, so where would he be in a hurry?
He trampled the Caucasus, now he tramples the Ukrainians, then the Baltic dwarves are next.
They've been pinching a Russian bear in their fur coat for a long time.
China will surely notice this, too, which somehow jumps out too much and certainly makes a slip to the Far East.
And those Germans are also pretty pissed off at Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r, how they are doing, and we gave it to them at 45 so on their ass.
How about making a new Novorossia in Karlovy Vary.
That would be a base and there are a lot of ours, and as they oppress them there and the dacha they already wanted to demolish some of them.
After all, our veterans will still remember how they were in Czechoslovakia.
Now, their Prime Minister Mr. Sobotka, who is so soft, can be peeled like onions and eat their whole EU.
That would be so much fun for them to jump on the big Russia.
They need to be reminded of where they belong.
And as detonators, we will use our fellow tribesmen who live on their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and when they are said to be oppressed there, they are simply oppressed there, and that is not what we will leave, we will protect them.
And again, the Russian will rule, for he is born for something else.
After all, Europe is only good as a premise on which the proud Ivan can dance to the Cossacks.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat over espionage report
Turkey’s foreign minister has called the country’s top U.S. diplomat to explain a report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the US charge d'affaires and Turkish government officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by a former analyst of the US National Security Agency, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of the report and said all major states are watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service also focused on Ankara, provoked a more indignant reaction from the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones series introduces other tricks of the fourth series
The creators of Game of Thrones are currently filming episodes of the fifth order of the cult series.
At the same time, they boasted about how the tricks of the fourth series were created.
The most visible are the computer adaptations of the serial environment and the mass scene, when a bunch of soldiers becomes a giant army of the famous Daenerys.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption
Complainants on Friday submitted evidence of blackmail by police and city council officials in the self-governing Calvia region to the Mallory Public Prosecutor's Office.
The director of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on charges brought by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of the bars and nightlife in Magaluf are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, on Friday, the complainants presented evidence of blackmail by police and city council officials in the self-governing region of Calvia to the prosecutor of the Mallordian anti-corruption office.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by Spanish state police on charges of corruption and will be heard by a judge along with Navarre.
The Spanish national daily ABC quoted dissatisfied nightclub owners as saying that the concessions made by public officials had a serious impact on their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about survival,” one businessman said in court.
Don't mess with our livelihood.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made headlines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist who gave oral sex to 24 men during a bar tour.
Since then, the island authorities have been trying to oversee drunks and rioters in the ranks of holiday party attendees in Magaful by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic bars tours.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the oral sex event took place, was forced to close for a year and, together with the organizers of Carnage's bar tour, to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is especially popular with the British, has also witnessed many alcohol-induced accidents, including a fashionable wave known as "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring marked by rain and storms that affected the flight at the airport in Adelaide
SPRING brought South Australia an ice surprise, came with heavy rain and strong winds that hit Adelaide’s airport seriously.
Another 5 mm of rain is expected to fall in the city until nine o’clock in the evening, and another 6.6 mm will fall during the night on Sunday.
The last rain came along with a few brief storm-related showers and gusts of wind that began before eight o'clock in the evening and brought nearly 4 mm of precipitation in about ten minutes.
After the winter of last week came several early doses of spring, temperatures in the city fell again on Monday to just 15.8 °C.
It is believed that stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 19:30, but over a short distance it was hit by a change in the speed or direction of the wind and was forced to postpone the landing.
Wind gusts at Adelaide Airport reached speeds of about 50 km/h on the ground at that time.
Flight data showed that the plane had to drop from the second landing and finally landed at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused delays to other flights, including Emirates’ flight from Dubai and Qantas’ flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is forecast to reach a maximum of 16°C on Tuesday, and one or two showers may occur.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near Gaza returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bomb shelters while rockets and mortars attacked their homes during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, but schools in Gaza remain closed as the territory recovers from fighting.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to communities in southern Israel marked by attacks, but signs of fighting are still visible.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, employees of a kindergarten hit by a rocket removed fragmentary remains from the wall and slowly await the return of the children.
"We're a little scared, but otherwise we're looking forward to it," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Saad Kibbutz and an English teacher at a local school.
Many children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to go back to school.
"We've been through some tough times and we haven't left the house at all," she said.
Kibbutz, near the Gaza border, was visited by President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the cease-fire ended last week, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas away from Gaza to escape rockets and mortars.
Many residents of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a Palestinian mortar shot killed a four-year-old boy, are hesitant to return.
The education minister said about 12 families had not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in substitute schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that was heavily hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged children to study diligently, adding: “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite peace deal on Tuesday.
While the cease-fire led to an immediate cessation of hostilities, it did not resolve key issues such as Hamas’s demand to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen airports and ports in Gaza.
Israel is demanding the disarming of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel questions these figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities in the south of the country.
The Israeli military has carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have taken refuge in hundreds of UN schools that have turned into temporary shelters.
Because of tens of thousands of people still in hiding and ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as well as Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from the school in Gaza’s largest city.
Willow at the meeting: I stand behind you.
And Lafayette is plagued by temperature
The Czech national football team met in Prague before noon on Wednesday before the preparation match with the USA and the subsequent opening match of the qualification of the European Championship against the Netherlands.
Of the 23-man squad, the Spartan striker David Lafata is troubled by the temperature.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, it was more players and David still has some problems.
But we want him to be here and he will be fine as soon as possible," coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"If it's two or three days, or if he's fit tomorrow, we'll see by his health condition, which our doctor will decide," he said.
The other players are fine.
“Of course, someone has some kind of pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or take part in a match on Wednesday with the United States,” he said.
On Sunday evening Vrba called the last player of the Spartan midfielder Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> V<0xC3><0xA1>cha.
He admitted that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also considered.
I decided on the basis that Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> is a promising player, who is 25 years old.
It was a very difficult decision, but I am behind it," said Vrba to V<0xC3><0xA1>ho.
What about Shural?
Let's see what happens to Latata.
It is possible that in case of health problems, the nomination could still be changed.
At the weekend, for example, Liberec's Josef <0xC5><0xA0>ural, who gave a hattrick, shone with a great performance.
Of course, there are players who have recently shown form.
We'll see how David Lafata does.
In the event that he will not be available on Wednesday, I do not claim that I cannot nominate any of the players who took part in the Czech league," Vrba said.
This afternoon there is a training team at Strahov, and on Tuesday there will be a classic pre-match training before a duel with the USA at Letn<0xC3><0xA1>, which will be open to fans and followed by an autograph.
The match with the Americans is played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the Prime Minister's victory at Vrba.
In the previous three pre-season games, he won two draws and lost once.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for 9 September at 8:45 p.m.
Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice goes to the Netherlands to Italy
Willow is glad that, unlike previous meetings, he has more time to train.
It’s an advantage when you have eight days of players and you can practice certain things with them that we may not have had as much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing for the Netherlands in the best possible way," Vrba praised himself.
The Dutch will present themselves in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague, and the duel will be personally watched by former interim national team coach Josef Pe<0xC5><0xA1>ice.
He'll give us the information from the match.
But it won't just be about him, we'll have the game on tape and we'll discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we will see what changes there will be," Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent World Cup.
According to highly monitored statistics, the prices of apartments in the winter period increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the index of the value of apartments in the Australian capital of Poland, Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices increased by 1.1% in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase led to an overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase rose to 10.9%, more than double in one year until August 2013, but the profit was not evenly distributed in the country.
Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading the market.
RP Data shows that apartment prices in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while prices in Melbourne increased by 11.7%.
Other strong markets included Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising between 5% and 6% on average.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by government-ordered spending cuts and where prices rose only by 1.4% during the year.
Lawless said that now that spring has begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the persistence of high auction rates, generally high sales rates and low interest rates, it is likely that the value of housing will rise even more over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never told me "I love you"
Henry was born in 1958 as one of the seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
They had a cooler relationship with their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked at the factory.
Henry rehearses a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary interview with his father and is part of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melody is optimistic.
But Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother's death, Henry underwent "extensive" therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice, "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a kid, they were adults — went to a bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket punch.
I've never talked to him like that.
For most of my life, he was a serious guy in a corner reading a newspaper.
Henry had recently visited a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father's day, he had an insight into what life must have been like for him.
There's a little more light out there today, but it's still a dark, smoky, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there's a lot of smoke and soot.
Dad always got in the tub and just lay there, and then you could hear him slowly singing for himself, because he was washing the foundry out of himself.
As I walked by, I realized that he had been doing this for years to support his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
Dad didn't hug anyone, he didn't say, "I love you."
It wasn’t until my mom was sick and dying that we started saying, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, who he has with Dawn French, allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Don't hug me all the time!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mom
French, with whom he was married for 25 years, is still a good friend.
Dawn's nice.
Why shouldn't Dawn and I be friends?
She's a great mom.
Henry's own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I was very, very overweight and the symptoms of diabetes began to show, the doctor said to me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and I also had to follow a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And tiring.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry's career may be reflected in his elegant, short-haired beard.
After being praised by critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theater.
It was followed by A Comedy Full of Mistakes and The Fence of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
The DJ spotted him on stage parodying someone and wrote about him in the New Faces talent contest.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black imitator/comedian on television."
He was learning on the march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I had to learn how to make good jokes, be a star, and perform on TV, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces in 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors disguised themselves as blacks, Henry eventually starred in it with his comedy for five years.
My family wasn't clean anymore because of it.
I wish it never happened, but I don't regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “the yearly and yearly acclaimed major product of British television” was also “a grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters who both ridiculed and celebrated British Negro culture.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show began airing in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
It took him another decade to get into commercials, documentaries, TV shows, and movie roles, but after airing his TV series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, "So what are you going to do now, Len, it's kind of like you're stuck in one place, or you're a little out of your way."
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's so great about...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was very allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn't really learn it in school, and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try it.”
Don't get involved if you don't know what you're talking about.
Try a few words and you'll see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry gave twenty lines of Othello's closing speech for the document, and he was already in it.
It made me feel like I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
"That's it. It's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the rehearsal was tough, and I read the game months and months ago.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which didn’t happen.
He soon began to play in a comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was in the National Theatre, and I couldn't believe it.
At one point, I thought, "You've changed."
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt that he had to take responsibility for confiscating the audience.
“The voice in my head said, ‘Before they fix the computer, you have to keep them entertained for ten minutes.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the performance would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, “Hmm, thank God.”
It's not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
"You're playing, so stay in the role."
Henry in Plots at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the fences was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game has also been well received, so it’s like God’s sign that says, “You should do this.”
Of course, he says it with a loud voice.
So I'm staying here.
I really like it.
I'm happy in the rehearsal room.
Henry, however, remains the brain of the comedian - all the time our conversation is interrupted by humorous performances, when he enters and exits the role of the imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups, because having the satisfaction of a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you're always looking for something, you can get into a dead end.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I'm not as happy as I used to be.
I asked him if he would ever do a stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in the same room with a director who helps give outlines of the beginning, the middle and the end of the journey - I don't think I'd ever want to give up.
So your new incarnation?
I think so.
I enjoy acting.
It's fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to shed light on non-existent workers
Kenya began biometrically registering all of its civil servants to try to remove a non-existent employee from the government's payroll.
According to the government, employees who do not register will no longer be paid in the next two weeks.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after they leave the civil service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to prevent corruption in the state administration.
An audit carried out this year showed that the state loses at least one million dollars (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month on the salaries of non-existent employees and on further abuses of official power.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts even after the employee’s death or after the employee leaves the state administration, said Wanyama Chebusiri, a BBC reporter from the capital Nairobi.
All civil servants must arrive at the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be biometrically recorded, the government said in a statement.
It also says that anyone who does not arrive without a sufficient apology will be excluded from the payroll.
“By identifying actual public service employees, this measure will make a significant contribution to its economy and will also be used to clean up the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent employees,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of the Ministry of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish Police Arrested for ‘Collusion’ Against Government
According to local media, a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government”.
Police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Dail News, 14 high-ranking officials were among those detained.
Some of them were involved in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials, including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone wiretapping.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then Prime Minister) described their actions as part of the actions of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine go back to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (September 1st) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told the present journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
Not all schools held a traditional ceremony on September 1st.
There is no peace in the whole of Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The whole of Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk visited by Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will acquire knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children putting on embroidered shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
In Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found a boss for difficult times
It carries with it clouds of fame from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclave of the conservative party.
She has experience on the front lines.
She began her career at Bain and Co, then continued through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She resigned as chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years when her junior colleague took the top position at Pearson's parent company.
It is said that her allowance was close to a million pounds.
Its political portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former director of BP, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became an adviser to the government.
Her husband is a former member of the city council.
In May, I described the director's job as a cup of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the center of public life, but there is also an inner paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: inward to the top layer of the BBC’s own leadership hierarchy, but also outward to the public in times of unrest when things don’t work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly, which requires a thorough reform.
But which director would risk coming to a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and taking his own job.
It's a tough challenge.
If it weren’t so difficult, many people would like to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and its status revise.
As competition expands and new technology challenges old certainty, immediate negotiations on concessionary fees for the BBC pose a great danger.
For a modest <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in what is certainly the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households, each costing only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the BBC’s popularity is clearly on the rise: to 53% of supporters, up from 31% ten years ago.
BBC service usage patterns have changed: Today, my headlines are displayed on my mobile phone, and I can watch the shows I missed on iPlayer.
But the BBC continues to be a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs an amazing director - I hope she found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says He Didn't Approve of Offensive Tweet
The tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, which was posted on Sunday, contained an offensive image of a Democratic prosecutor who initiated Perry’s criminal charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another one was posted on Perry's account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
A tweet that wasn't authorized left my account.
"I disagree with the tweet and I pulled it," he said in another post.
Perry's assistants didn't answer the questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it is unclear who is actually responsible for managing it.
The previous tweet posted a flattering, humorous picture of Attorney General Travis County Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay out funds for her office, which brought Perry, a possible presidential candidate in the 2016 election, to a grand jury in Austin this month.
A tweet said: “I don’t always drive with three times my blood alcohol level... but if I do, I’m suing Governor Perry for holding me accountable.”
I'm the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by Lehmberg's office.
He was overseen by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charge a tactical, political maneuver.
His qualified legal team has asked the court supervising the case to dismiss the charges because the use of laws to prosecute the longest serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry cut off a $7.5 million disbursement from the state-run Department of Public Interest, which is based in Travis County and prosecuting corruption in Texas, after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint by a left-wing group of civic activists.
Perry's official account is active - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth on his party’s committee in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculation that he might end up with a tweet of his own with a photo of him running near the lake and saying, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is returning to “normal”
One of London’s most prominent development companies has warned that the housing market has “returned” to normal levels of activity in southeast England.
Housing in the capital has been subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to impose limits on mortgages in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley Demand Client Development Company, said on Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak in 2013.
London’s housing market did well during the downturn, as foreign buyers flooded the capital.
According to data from the Cadastral Office, prices in the city jumped by 18.5% last year alone, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling price of Berkeley’s private, affordable and student housing rose by about a fifth last year, and climbed to <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening of the pound, London properties have not been so attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and talk of a possible "seed tax" that politicians came up with before the parliamentary elections next May.
London-based real estate firm Foxtons warned last week that an April review of the mortgage market, which introduced stricter rules for loans, would also slow the pace of market growth in both real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a decline in the number of approved mortgages for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, lowered its forecast for London property prices to 3% in 2015 as house prices began to fall.
Meanwhile, transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington fell by a quarter each year, according to WA Ellis.
Yet demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “Demand for the right, good-looking housing in a good location has remained the same, and as a result, forward sales have continued.”
In June, the company announced that it had sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased by 40% to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, revenues by 18% to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
On Monday, ahead of Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that Berkeley’s annual revenues are projected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before tax will be 450 million pounds.
Berkeley's stock stopped at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
The hacker posted photos of Jennifer Lawrence naked on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence arrives for the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence leaked to the Internet after a hacker claimed to have a "list" of photos of hundreds of other aspiring actresses.
A spokesperson for the film star, Hunger Games, confirmed that Lawrence’s photos were genuine and criticized the hacker for “obvious privacy violations.”
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker's photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan image-sharing server, were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple's iCloud web storage system. The alleged list of photos of the victims hacked according to BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It’s unclear how many photos are authentic, but the star of the film “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took privately at home years ago are happy with themselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known from the cable TV series Nickolodeon "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were real. She tweeted: "These supposed nude photos of me are SURFACE, people."
It is better to cut it even in the crack. *intentional word play*.
Buzzfeed announced on Sunday evening that pop star Ariana Grande's spokesman denied the alleged photos were genuine.
An extraordinary excerpt from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J"
They disintegrated, that's the best way to describe it, gradually disintegrated like a cardboard box that someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time did a woman tell him that he was too serious, too complex, too violent, too isolated, and maybe a little pushy.
And then she shook his hand.
He admitted it in vain.
He could pee like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of his ability was a beginning lover’s tangle, which more than usual promised to relieve his lonely life boredom and perhaps give him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with a wild mane of hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and inhospitable than Port Reuben.
She came to the south with an older companion, whom Kevern thought was her aunt, who had inherited property in a damp but beautiful valley called, appropriately, the Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were dead spiders in the tubs, the slugs sluggishly signed on the windows, as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden was overgrown, and the weeds resembled huge heads of cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from children's stories, scary and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the preliminary list of nominations for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
A shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn sat in folding chairs in the long grass, holding hands with his father, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, absently tuning the public station, which supplied the region with soothing music and soothing news, as the sight of her tanned crossed legs reminded him of the old scribble.
Your legs are too big.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, they no longer played such songs on the radio.
They weren't forbidden - really nothing was forbidden - they just weren't playing.
They helped them get to the desuetudo, as well as the word desuetudo itself.
The taste of the people has proved something that regulations and outlaws would never do, and just as people choose memoirs about books in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cooks and romance novels, so in music ballads are chosen.
The cavern was pulled to the floor and began to play the imaginary piano, and in a coarse, comic voice he sang the serenade to Ailla's big feet.
Ailin didn't understand.
"That was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fats Waller," he said, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
That's what his father always did when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game when he was a kid.
His father told him that he played the game with his father.
When you didn't put two fingers in front of your mouth at the word that started on j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn't funny then, and it wasn't funny now.
He just knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard one.
Even jazz, although not directly built out of the law, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There was only room for one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
The same in humor.
His unpredictability got people's nerves.
And jazz was the humour expressed by the song.
Although he had not heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten years old, Kevern knew jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least he didn't have to tell Aillin that Fats Waller was black.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember a time when popular singers weren’t black.
No laws or pressure, either.
A voluntary society is one in which every part of it, with gratitude – with gratitude from those who were fortunately spared – agrees with the principle of group gratitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean descent with temperament and constitution threw for entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and ran.
People from the Indian subcontinent, as if nature gifted with electronics, took responsibility for the fact that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were plumbers, the Greeks who remained were washing dishes.
Those of the Gulf States and the Levant, whose great-grandparents did not quickly leave the country, while what happened happened, if it happened - they were afraid that they would be accused of putting it in the fire, they were actually afraid that the fire would consume them the next time - they opened a restaurant where they were not sold for food and smoke.
To each according to his talent.
Since she only listened to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the dirty words Kavern had just sung for her could have turned into music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really rude," Kevern said.
Maybe just for people with too big legs.
My father never hurt anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave the illusion of safety.
Not a word could escape from the soundproofed sheets.
Ailin still didn't understand.
Why would your father like something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She already thought he was weird.
"She seemed funny," he said at last.
She shook her head incredulously and overshadowed Kevern's view.
There was nothing in the whole wide world but the confusion of her raven hair.
He didn't want to see anything else.
"If you think so," she said doubtfully.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She looked really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not the feet at all.
Maybe some ankles...
You're saying you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate?
That's not true.
It's just a stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon.
"I'm attracted to your fat ankles," he said.
I'm kind of perverted.
That didn't work out.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often got him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic needed to tame the cruelty that lurked in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel on purpose.
Maybe Kavern was intentionally cruel.
Despite the kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons blushed and rose from the couch, dropped the radio and spilled the undrinking wine.
It's a bezinc wine, so it's not worth the drink.
She seemed to tremble in her agitation like palm leaves in a storm.
"I find it perverse that you're an idiot," she said.
Except I'm not attracted to it.
She felt sorry for him, both because of his unkind words and because of the fear she had in her eyes as she confronted him.
Did she think she'd get hit?
She didn't talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he had no doubt that the basics were the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean was trembling over them.
The same confused men, after what had happened, even more reckless and troublesome than their forefathers, smugglers and carnivores, roamed furiously from pub to pub, ready to reach out to any woman who dared refuse them or laugh at them.
Stupid?
If she's not careful, they'll show her their fists!
First to smear her - to smear has become the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antidote to the faint ballads of love that the radio spewed - first to smear her, then to kill her.
In Kever's view, over-cultivation, because cuddling was itself an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons nonverbally suggested he leave.
He got up from his couch like an old man.
She felt annoyed, but the weight of his sadness surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him leave - as if watching him from a window on the floor - a man caught up with what he had done himself.
Adam was leaving the garden, she thought.
Her heart was closed for him and for all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, his shoulders drooping, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him - why did she think she knew this look well, even though she couldn't remember a single moment, until today, when she'd ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, alone again, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory monitoring system of Public Mood, prepared a short article on the persistence of light and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where its easing or direct cessation was most expected, if only to be expected.
"A lot has been done and a lot still has to be done," she wrote, "to calm the innate aggression of the people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the cramped, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of church towers towering over hedges, a hint of human kindness has historically seldom appeared."
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the impulses.
Residents sigh at the sentimental ballads, swallow the unfortunate stories and claim to firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only is the old brutality held in rural areas as hard as in urban agglomerations, but the evidence also shows that at home, in the workplace and on the roads of sports.
"Unfortunately, you tend to be too blushing," her superior said.
I would suggest that you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum tilted her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to answer that," Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again defended her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Another silence.
"That's not why I'm asking," Rabinowitz said, "that I have something against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
There's no prejudice in this workplace.
We serve an unbiased society.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is perfectly acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously, you yourself are biased towards the Church – things you call “cruel” and “brutal” could be interpreted by others also as expressions of natural strength and energy.
To constantly deal with WHAT HAPPENED, WHEN IT HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it had happened, yesterday, prepares the earth with its basic life force.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head, a recommendation flashed pink on the light board, which Ofnow had been sending out to the world for the past quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
“To speak is better than to be silent; a sung word is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.”
"I totally understand your reservations," said Esme Nussbaum quietly, when she was sure her superior was finished, "and I'm not saying that the wound hasn't healed the way we pretend it has.
My main concern is that if we don’t warn you in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to what happened if it happened.
This time, however, we will not vent anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz put his fingertips together.
That meant endless patience.
"You go too far," he said, "when you describe the steps they may have taken and may not have done by your grandparents as mistakes.
You also go too far in saying that you have ventilated your “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
I should not remind anyone in your position that we are not talking about “us” and “them” in understanding the past and protecting the present.
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
All we know is that these were chaotic times.
"In the course of which, if we are honest with each other," Esme took courage, "we are not blameless.
I'm not blaming anyone.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add - we agree on this.
And just as there is no guilt to be sedated, there are no things to be corrected even if the correction were appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past for than to learn from it?
The past exists to be forgotten.
If there's anything I can say about it--
Luther Rabinowitz untied his fingertips.
"I'll take your report into account," he said, releasing her.
The day after she went to work as usual, she was hit by a motorcyclist who drove on the sidewalk in a way that passers-by described as “brutal and furious.”
Accidents happen.
The army of the Kingdom of Lesotho says no coup is planned - the prime minister remains in South Africa
The military officers of the Kingdom of Lesotho have denied organising a coup to overthrow the government, claiming to have acted against police suspected of attempting to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and says the army has surrounded its official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
After saying he was being threatened with death, the prime minister and his family left for neighbouring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but the army’s response to the threat of “political fanatics” the police were trying to arm.
“This morning, the command of the Kingdom of Lesotho’s defence forces acted after receiving several news reports from the information service that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who were about to trigger the country,” he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
"Although no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of Lesotho's defence forces appear to bear the marks of a coup d'état," he said.
The military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers had returned to their barracks on Sunday and the capital was calm.
During Thaban's absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be responsible for the government.
Thabane said he believed he was the target of an attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been raging in Lesotho since June, when Thabane suspended a session of parliament over internal disputes.
He said that despite the opposite claims, he did not undermine his actions by the government.
Production in the euro area is at a 13-month low
Production growth slowed to a 13-month low in the euro area in August, according to a closely monitored survey.
The final euro area Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 signifies expansion.
New orders have fallen and factories have been damaged by rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come from Thursday's meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB).
Markets will want a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with the eurozone’s delayed recovery and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnant to 0.3%.
There have been speculations that ECB Director Mario Draghi may have indicated this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the euro area, similar to what the United Kingdom and the United States did during the financial crisis.
“Although at least some growth is better than no growth, the inhibitory effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on producers is increasingly visible,” said Rob Dobson, Markit’s chief economist.
The production PMI of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
In the zone's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
Concerns have been raised about France, while Italy has shifted from expansion to stagnation.
Signs that the growth engine in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands has vanished are also not very reassuring,” Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is likely to add fuel to the fire for analysts expecting the implementation of other monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August production overview of purchasing managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the euro area are currently having a very difficult life, because the increasing geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add to the still challenging conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This growing trade uncertainty has been demonstrably impacted - especially consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, especially the expensive ones.
He said it appeared “even more likely” that the ECB would eventually have to implement some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten Years of Hell for Beslan Survivors: Ten Years of the Horrors of Busy School Children Still Suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day suffering that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
Exactly ten years after the horrific occupation of a school in Beslan that killed 334 people, including 186 children, survivors warned of a new apocalypse in Ukraine last night.
When fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, it seemed like the deepest bottom of hell.
The resistance to the tragedy united East and West, leading to negotiations and a future in this catastrophic disaster.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, southern Russia, to search for some of the victims who had escaped death during the school atrocities.
We found amazing young people who resisted the misfortune, even though the memory of the hell caused by the terrorists will live on in them.
What is their biggest wish?
That the war that is now destroying Ukraine - and in which children like them are dying - is over.
Girl Trying To Get Back Into Destroyed School Gym
It was captured by the leading Russian photographer, Dimitri Beliakov, as she tried to get back into the school gym in her underwear after a bomb exploded.
Confused, Aida desperately sought out her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
There were fears that they were both dead, but they actually survived.
"A woman told me to run and save my life, but I couldn't," Aida said.
My legs were made of blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier rescued her.
After several surgeries, she thought she was fully healed, but yesterday she said: “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'm going to have to have another operation.
I've got fragments left in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so she can help people the way doctors have helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it certainly didn't destroy it," she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it can’t be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
Otherwise, we try not to talk to our friends about it.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate, Jer Gapoeva, was killed there.
When we were little, we played together and imagined going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start a career.
I'll think about the family later.
She says she hasn't forgotten about the captivity, but the memories fade a little every year.
I am glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we are very grateful for the help we have received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the Internet as I climb through the school window, I think that a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the rain of bullets and believed his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (in Russia, children start school at the age of seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the arms of his mother Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “My mom told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the ground and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
He was afraid she was dead, and he ran, and on the way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the child's hand, and ran with a splash of bullets.
His father, Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me that his mother is dead.”
She said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in a hospital with a wounded leg, and on the contrary, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said: “I was crying with happiness.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the vanished News of the World), where he was declared the winner of Bernardo's Children by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it," he said yesterday.
But I can tell you that the memories are fading.
I remember throwing away all my playing guns right after that.
But today I can play computer games where they shoot, and I have no problem with that.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I’m not thinking about myself.
I remember the kids I played with in the yard and they didn't get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop and how I drove a convertible.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where the war has suffered as he and his friends have suffered.
The horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it
“I feel very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horrors,” said Damir, who took part in the monastery’s volunteer work last week.
I want to help so much.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be accepted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says, “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the silence right after the attack, there were no children screaming and running around, and the silence lasted for months.
He vividly remembers the journey with Damir to London.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and say in person that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir having a taste for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them with a water pistol, and they were running and playing with him.
And that was only a month after the horror.
I was surprised at how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said: “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in ten years.
Now there is a war in Ukraine, every day people die, and I think many children have been and will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news that they listen to when they are bored or doing something else.
I know what these people are going through, what horror it is.
I can still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it's so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a nice and quiet boy, not at all aggressive or angry.
For example, he doesn't want revenge, he doesn't care at all.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he's very close to six classmates, and from time to time, he goes to the gym and lights candles.
When he was younger, he had trouble with it—I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying there for hours.
He wasn't sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember that he threw away all his guns or other weapons for playing. Damir is 17 today, he is taller than me, handsome, smart and healthy.
I can't believe I was sure for hours that he was dead and I'd never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and rose to my feet, I looked around and saw the hell, there were pieces of human bodies everywhere.
I was pretty sure my little boy didn't have a chance to survive this hell.
“I remember yelling, ‘Damir, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
But he heard her and ran away.
So our lives go further than others.
Grigory Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of the horrors in Beslan
Consolation: Beslan Survivor Grigory Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigory today
As he fled for his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was embedded in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocity in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a doctor, dropped him off on his first day at school and rushed to take his eldest son Vladimir to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the yard, so my little boy stayed there alone for three days," she recalled.
Not all alone, because we had relatives there, but they all died there.
Only my Grigory survived.
As the date approaches, it becomes more and more difficult to think and talk about it.
Not a day goes by that we don't remember the tragedy.
It doesn’t seem like it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments are still coming back to me.
I promise no one will ever forget.
Still-returning memories: A picture of Grigory (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right)
I remember Grigory looking forward to school that day, saying he wanted to hug his teacher.
I found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
There's even a statue of Grigory crying in San Marino.
Grigory doesn't like to look at this picture and we have it hidden in the library at home.
I get it, but I also think that this picture makes people all over the world know how much pain we feel.
Today Grigory says: “It is important that this does not happen again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
Such tragedies are still being investigated, but no one will ever know the truth.
Now they're investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, so how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, it takes decades.
It had an impact on my health, I can still feel it.
I had three or four years because of a nightmare attack, but then it got better.
When I returned to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
So when it comes to September 1st, I go to the gym.
I want to honor the memory of my childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into that gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is a thing of the past.
I won't forget it, but I don't regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiac surgeon.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn't because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I can't.
Grogory Farniyev, 20
The Boy Who Survived Even When He Was Held At The Feet Of A Terrorist Killer
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of a murdering terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught trapped in a gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a murdering terrorist.
It's a real miracle he survived.
“It feels like it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become a Federal Security Service agent, but couldn’t because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It's still with me, it's not something I've thrown away.
Now that I am older, it is said that children with bad experiences can cope better - I must say that this is not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - a year later - it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted.
I'll never go there again, and please don't ask me to show you where I'm sitting in this well-known picture.
Survivors: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
Friends know I don't like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me about school.
As far as my physical health is concerned, I am fine.
I have to be careful with my knee, which I hurt, but I'm walking normally now.
But even so, because of my health, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this was not possible.
My other hobby is animals, so I went to the vet.
I finished my second year there.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cats to cows”.
He said: “I know I will never tell my children about this.
It is not something that children should know about, and not something that they should experience at all.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain will be here all the time.
It's inside, and it's getting worse with the anniversary approaching.
I will attend the commemoration ceremonies.
I know Grigori won't go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help him.
I'm so grateful to God that he gave it back to me, there's traces everywhere here in Beslan.
It stays with us.
Gregory's an adult today, but he's still carrying the horror.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several surgeries, he can walk, but he cannot exercise.
I'd say 50% of the time you've overcome that fear, but you can't completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
They killed a lot of our friends and neighbors during the attack, and that only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me, and that's the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me to lose those who were killed.
I know families where more children were born, but also widows who never got married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I'm watching what's happening in the world - wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past, we were one friendly country, so how did we get to the point where we're fighting together now?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will be killed.
If only we could take all the rebels and throw them away - as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child who was taken to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyona Tskaeva is taken to a safe Russian special commando (left).
He is now ten years old (right) and does not remember the tragedy at all.
In 2004, a Russian policeman took little Alyona out of Beslan captivity in his arms.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in a school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan remarried and they have a daughter named Kristina after her dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, now ten, doesn’t remember the attack at all and has grown into a bright and happy girl.
A close friend said, “It’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the children away from the memories that the tenth anniversary commemorates.
You can understand why.
Man accused of hitting a girl at a sign crossing in Fife
An eighty-seven-year-old man is on trial for hitting a three-year-old girl at a sign crossing in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly hit the girl at a crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The plaintiffs allege that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, denied the Anstruther charges in Dundee.
Judge Charles Macnair has set a stand date for January.
4 tips on how to take better photos and videos underwater
If you are interested in taking photos or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an outdoor GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with a couple of cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It does not matter what equipment you use, but for the best results, several rules apply.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the batteries and other parts are tightly closed.
Next, adjust the camera depending on the type of photos or videos you take.
Some cameras and camcorders have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure to a dark underwater environment.
And before you do, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed only up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60 feet.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both standard and waterproof design.
Always take a few pictures - a lot of them will not work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose your photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be poorly visible underwater and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
So always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of images with slightly different exposure dispersion, take advantage of this.
Stay close to the level.
With a deeper dive, the light decreases significantly.
If possible, keep close to the surface when taking photos in the pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to capture more light in your photos - the deeper you go, the fewer colors you will see.
Get close to the photographed object.
That’s great advice if you’re shooting on land, but underwater it’s even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose strength of personality was able to change things even in an organization as huge as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to relieving the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was a MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that maimed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focused on diagnosis and disease, patients treated in the vast majority were interested in something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one who started to suffer.
"I don't feel in my skin," he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found himself impatient, and his wife Juliet included remorse.
He remarked, “I want everything to happen sooner rather than later.”
When Juliet left for a week on a business trip, Lawson was unusually and inexplicably upset.
Something was wrong.
A colleague gave him a chest X-ray.
He had skied in the French Alps two weeks earlier.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the lining of the lungs.
For most types of cancer, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients smoke.
Mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, it is the cause of exposure to asbestos - a fibrous building material that was previously referred to as "miracle", but today is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore the mesothelioma.
Asbestos, after all, belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos in Britain has not been used since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into force.
Even at the time asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as isolationists, builders, carpenters, and shipyard workers.
Toxin used in industry in another era is hardly a cause for concern today.
But such complacency is not appropriate.
As it turns out, the Mesothelioma epidemic is at its peak in Britain today.
The death toll from mesothelioma is higher than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths a year from this disease are twice as many as the number of victims of car accidents.
Number of deaths from mesothelioma per year since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only now feeling its effects, even though the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades for mesothelioma to develop.
The disaster in the form of a mesothelioma does not only concern veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes in which we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we learn, and in the shops where we shop.
Thus, the Mesothelioma does not respect the social stratum, wealth, occupation, or age.
The privileged bastions, from London’s department stores to public schools, are no refuge.
Parliament is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals in which they should treat us are the repositories of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He didn't even isolate himself.
He was trying to figure out where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he figured it out.
"It's possible that there was a lot of asbestos in the basement corridors of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years practicing," he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the corridors.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, that was a question he could partially answer.
"Of the four physicians who were on the practice at Guy's Hospital and who then developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he noted in a 2010 letter, "I'm the only one still alive."
How many of us will get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not common.
55% of people diagnosed with mesothelioma will die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
Professor Julian Pete, a leading British expert on mesothelioma, estimates that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is taking place in Britain, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them have no idea that they will die this way.
Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada
A quick look at the files from the archives of the courts, to which the disabled often turn and demand compensation, shows how much the mesotheliomic disaster has spread.
For example, this June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it had recklessly exposed Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she supervised two stores in the clothing section - one of the places was the company's flagship, the Oxford Street store.
Allen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
Today he has two children who are over 20.
"Before that happened," he says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma before, barely knew anything about asbestos.
It never occurred to me in my dreams that it might affect me.
Not many people know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
Its name is due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, commonly known as white asbestos, is most commonly found in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler gaskets and even in brake lining.
While it is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, the EU and WHO still consider it a “great health risk” that can cause death.
However, brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crokydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts claim that “there is compelling but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exhibited asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London.
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but the work of Julian Pete points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that “a significant proportion of cases of mesothelioma without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the “common use and weathering” of buildings.
It seems that no one can be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which explored the Palace of Westminster, shows that even people in the center of government may not know they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report claiming that the service elevators and pipes behind the chambers of the Parliamentary Committee were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be broken by something as harmless as a "strong stream of air."
Ministers are often accused of caring only for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although the Parliament's services directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster receive a "positive medical certificate", it is now expected that it will take one million pounds and several years of work to thoroughly examine Parliament, modernise electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the elections in 2015, the MPs will be in the center instead of on the green benches in the West.
Goddard’s report states that “the presence of asbestos does not comply with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this discrepancy will cost lives.
Now everyone can just wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they were exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a physician.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
But he clearly remembers the day in early December 2009, when he was overcome by something like a chill.
He was 45, it was evening, and he was in the middle of an operation.
Suddenly I shuddered.
It came all at once.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd get home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew the pain was coming from the thorax, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He spent a month at home.
Confused doctors X-rayed his chest and placed a chest catheter to remove the fluid they had sent for analysis from his lungs.
However, they did not diagnose.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after he exercised and breathed.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and at work he came into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the connection was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-ray images with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a camera probe was introduced into the space between the chest and lung linings.
I'm an optimist.
I tend not to take too much," he says.
To be honest, I wasn't too worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: "They told me it was a mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: diagnosed with mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“Asbestos has been found to be widely used, especially in large public buildings that often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now beginning to experience the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes were found in hospitals in the basement, so they were unlikely to endanger patients.
However, staff members who passed through the basement corridors between buildings (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (like often Graham Abbott) certainly came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, a few decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients’ lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos has been removed to this day.
Pupils built Bunsen's kahan on asbestos pads
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulating and non-flammable properties.
In schools, too.
In fact, many people have already been exposed to asbestos in school.
Somewhere in myriad hours of chemistry, students built Bunsen's kahan on an asbestos mat.
A website has been created to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” said Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was only one contact with asbestos that a woman suffering from mesothelioma could remember in the 1970s when she demolished a garden house.
So be careful how you demolish the garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of the diagnosis is huge.
"It takes a while for you to figure it out," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found that I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'm not gonna live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of a doctor to the position of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was told 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to live another Christmas.
That's it."
Mesothelioma is particularly destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive — breathing itself — is what causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of small fibers.
When asbestos breaks and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiac surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treats other patients who have been exposed to asbestos probably during their practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treasure says, and “breathing alone pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
It is invasive from the very beginning.
On mesothelioma common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take so much.
For example, the effectiveness of the operation is hotly debated.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't remove the lump," he says.
You won't get a scalpel around her.
Cancer “doesn’t respond too well to chemotherapy,” which, while “has some effect,” doesn’t cure.
“Sometimes there is someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After finding mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally disabled people.
When they called, he happily introduced himself, "Hello, you've reached the cancer center."
"It was very positive," Abbott says.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
In the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would last four months, and would probably extend his life by only a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I wanted to give up.
Lawson, however, "was able to show things in a more optimistic light."
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduski of the Department of Thoracic Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
"I had the advantage of not having to wait for them to send me to him, but I just called and they examined me," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to get a claim and they would have to approve payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is crucial for patients with mesothelioma.
But when various treatments inevitably fail, many patients face other financial worries — about the future of the family they leave behind.
And that's why they're turning to the courts and want compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, asbestos has been known to be harmful to health,” Morgan said.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even a very small amount of it could pose a health risk.
And here we encounter the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, this was not a "full settlement" because Lawson could not definitively prove that the mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy’s Hospital confirmed that “asbestos in the incriminated basement was removed in the 1990s.”
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
To reduce the exposure of lethal asbestos to one company or place of work - usually decades after it happened - has proven to be a huge problem for patients with mesothelioma seeking compensation.
Many former workplaces have changed owners or gone bankrupt.
The insurance records are gone.
And those who are now resisting the charges have time on their side, which their accusers certainly do not.
In response to this fact, important new legislation was approved this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek settlement, even if it is not possible to trace their former employer.
The law created a 350 million dollar financial reserve paid by insurance companies, which is intended for people diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In this case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign to them as compensation - approximately <0xC2><0xA3>120,000.
Each year, 300 applications are expected to be successfully processed.
Andrew Morgan, like mesothelioma patients, thinks <0xC2><0xA3>350 million is “good work.”
“It’s an agreement written by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if it didn’t hit time and people with mesothelioma would be able to track down former employers and sue them in a normal way.
Even Mike Penning, former Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given the seven deaths each year, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said during a second reading of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, he recommended Lang-Lazdunski's surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasure, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a triple treatment in which Lang-Lazdunski can boast a five-year survival rate in up to 40% of patients.
Abbott made it stronger.
"Of course, that's not the most important thing," Abbott says.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Inspections showed no signs of illness.
I went to another check in March [2014].
In my chest I had a few spots [cancer].
I was just approaching my 50th birthday.
It's not life-threatening.
It's taking him.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy again.
Currently, there are no traces of cancer in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - financial security when I die, or to show a woman how the alarm clock works on the boiler.
When you hear the bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look ahead.
Like fathers Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14), it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition meant I would never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very sociable and wild.
She told her friends, and suddenly a lot of people started calling us.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
All cancer patients have to face such conversations.
In patients with mesothelioma, however, such conversations are not lightened by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and ultimately brought with it to Stephen Jay Gould) an unsatisfactory certainty.
As Andrew Morgan said, “Mesothelioma does not threaten life.”
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos cloth.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen cooking pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
A fabric was invented that is non-combustible.
I saw napkins made of it that glowed in the fireplaces at the banquets
In Italy, asbestos begins to appear in commercial use, it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa, soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
During the Industrial Revolution, it was an excellent insulating substance in steam engines and turbines.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Prudential’s statistics show a higher mortality rate for people working with asbestos, and life insurance is then denied to those who work with asbestos.
Nellie Kershaw is dying in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke confirms that the asbestos particles in her lungs “were undoubtedly the cause of her death.”
This is the first case of this kind.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, deny responsibility.
They won't pay any compensation.
During World War II, ships were being built intensively, and work in shipyards represented the highest risk of exposure to asbestos.
Prohibition of Blue Asbestos
The Court of Appeals upholds the first successful claim for damage to health resulting from exposure to asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The UK imports 139 000 tonnes.
The British Institute of Health and Safety requires all asbestos suppliers to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
In the UK, the use of all types of asbestos is prohibited.
The Mesothelioma Act enters into force in the United Kingdom.
A $350 million compensation program has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but in many parts of the world, white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material.
World production is kept at two million tons per year.
China Refuses to Give Hong Kong the Power to Choose Leadership: Protesters Promise Revenge
China’s parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s commercial district as activists began organizing and preparing just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People’s Congress essentially allows communist leaders to eliminate any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it angered us,” said Emily Lau, the Democratic Party’s chairwoman.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
People in Hong Kong were lied to.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos".
Since 1997, when Britain returned Hong Kong to China, Beijing has promised that from 2017 onwards, residents will be able to vote in the executive branch.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders are firmly holding in their hands the process of nominating a committee that is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be allowed.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
The majority of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong are backed by the Occupy Central Movement with Love and Peace, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy in the Rain movement gathered outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that it would launch a wave of protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently they wanted to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said the movement “considered occupying the Central as only the last step if all possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other option left.
We regret to announce that today all the possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the Centre is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and on Sunday they stepped up security at the government's headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
The incitement of unrest is, according to many residents of Hong Kong, a sign that they are slowly losing control of the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There is also growing concern that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bent by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupy Central movement and say their demonstrations threaten trade – Hong Kong’s lifeboat.
“The protest he’s talking about could cause much more economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a long-time critic of the movement.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such a perception could harm the investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days that portray Hong Kong’s democratic activists as subversive Western-led agents.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people attended one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
Electoral agitator?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
In the regional town of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, about 1,600 amateur athletes play small football.
And their highest competition is now called Together for Jihlava League.
It was named after a movement that is heading to the October municipal elections.
The top ten of his candidacy is also the head of a small football club in Jihlava, Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
"There was a general meeting where there was no problem," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
The situation around the first league of small footballers has already been dealt with by the lawyers of the Jihlava City Hall and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
According to the website of the city, the small football club won about a million crowns last year.
This year, too, it’s hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure of small digging is not contrary to the law or the directives of the magistrate.
However, the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for granting grants and subsidies," said the spokesman of the City of Tulis.
Drawing subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing as a small football support in the elections of one political party, this is unlikely to happen.
A similar demand from politicians has not yet come to the highland "great" football.
That the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD regional division, ODS division or KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL 1 would have been created.
And class and competitions like that?
I wouldn't mind.
On the contrary, I would like sponsors from the ranks of companies to contact us," noted the chairman of the regional football association Miroslav Vrza<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
The head of small football of the other party and the movement will not allow in the name of the league
According to the players of the small football team, this sport in Jihlava would have earned its own campus with six playgrounds, cloakrooms and bathrooms.
"For example, the playground Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>ch is not ours, we are rented there," said Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Lape<0xC5><0xA1> from Starlet Jihlava.
The most suitable location would be the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> ml<0xC3><0xBD>n.
But there will be built, for example, in my opinion, a meaningless area for skaters, of which there are about fifty in Jihlava," Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka said.
Mayor of Jihlava Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) reacted that a small football field uses artificial grass in the streets of Ro<0xC5><0xA1>ick<0xC3><0xBD> and Na Stoup<0xC3><0xA1>ch, which are owned by the city.
We want to build such playgrounds that have the maximum use.
We are going to modernize or build sports facilities at schools, which will be accessible in the afternoon.
I think there has been tremendous progress in the last few years for a small football," he added.
Other political parties in the league names will not appear, according to Jan Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka.
We have limitations.
If someone from one field joins us, we do not put the other one there anymore,” he explained.
"The political movement in the name of the league, I consider it at least an unfortunate step," said Karel Vold<0xC3><0xA1>n, a member of the City Council Committee for Sport.
"But let the voters assess whether Mr<0xC3><0xA1>ka is using the Mal<0xC3><0xA1> kopana Jihlava association and subsidies from the city for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life - first-year students can fly jet planes
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression on arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Stewart also stated that the service has its own security side.
The service is an ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their belongings across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to making sure that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since services had just started, they had no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay an annual tuition fee of <0xC2><0xA3>9,000, it expects the service to find its place in the market.
Compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression, and the VIF program is exactly the right way to achieve it.
The National Union of Students, however, criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice President of the Higher Education Union, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students entering university this month have to cope with the financial crisis before throwing away thousands of pounds for something as simple as arriving at a dormitory, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants cannot keep up with the rising costs of basic necessities.
Feminists protest against racism and police behaviour after Ferguson incident
Earlier this month, a police officer killed an unarmed young man in Ferguson, Missouri.
Those waiting for the funeral with their hands up chanted, “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of an unarmed young man named Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noted a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With rising tensions in the Midwest, which attracted the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of white women was 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of blacks shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as "the thought of a white woman over Ferguson" or "Feminism is not just about oppression of women" appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this represents an important change.
“I don’t think there’s a lot of people in the feminist movement talking about race and privilege at that level,” she said.
People felt that they had to express themselves about what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing, because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racially motivated that they had to draw attention to it.
According to Koritha Mitchell, an English professor at Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light the problems that African-American women have to face every day and that are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories about my life with my partner on Facebook and get 150 characters from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the colored being trapped in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it possible for a woman to speak publicly about relationships, but not about safety in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have dealt with race, gender, and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
According to her, black women could not afford the luxury to clearly divide these problems: every day they live in this mixed reality.
Although white women today share the issue of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black people were lynched, and the reason was in almost all cases of rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the cooperation of white women.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when campaigners like Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have the right to vote.
“They decided to bet cards on the right to vote for women and the right for blacks to focus later,” Hattery said.
Realizing this, we get an important insight into why colored women don't trust white women.
We didn't do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained suffrage in 1920, it took them ten years to organize against lynching in the Southern Women's Association to prevent lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the upsurge in the response of white feminists to questions raised in Ferguson - the issue of police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white feminists had to "catch up" with the issues that black women had been grappling with for generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these areas [of traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?”
The second wave of feminists who have made careers a struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now figuring out what it means.
Notable feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem were taken two weeks after Michael Brown was shot dead by a Facebook attack, where they published a column by Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more strongly against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society — and opinions about race that differ significantly in opinion polls — will seek change,” Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes issues of race and gender, her comments on the race issue in America confuse some people.
American Enterprise Institute expert Christina Sommers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but the remarks by Steinem’s Ferguson party face criticism that she had previously elicited.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small My Brother's Keeper program to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it triggered anger among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism’s interest.
After U.S. border police detained nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors this year in the southwest of the country, the issue of reforming immigration laws has once again arisen - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women to reform immigration laws, said that in order to present the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
"He speaks for himself," Mercad said.
As most work permits are given to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
"These stories have a resonance in women's organizations," she said.
Pig residence in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed the picture of the house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig was resting on it in the living room.
One-room detached house, which is for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120,000, stands on a private road in Ipswich.
Information photos included a picture of the living room in which the pig rests with his head on the sofa.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner’s pet.
"The photo was found by mistake, and therefore it has already been removed," an office spokesman said.
In the property information, Connells described the former prayer house as "a singular one-room house."
Although the office has already removed the photo from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house aroused interest on social networks, where some asked whether the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey has a fresh millionaire in the southwest.
A lottery player in Harvey wins a million.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in southeast Perth, with one lucky winner taking home $1.1 million from Saturday’s lottery campaign.
Traffic in Harvey had the second time in five years, the last time it was a million-dollar win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to register.
Store owner Steve Forward said the entire city in southwest Perth was talking about winning.
It's the main topic, and everyone's upset.
We thought a similar win was a touch.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending several happy weeks.
Last weekend, a Canning Vale player became one of five August millionaires, and just a few weeks earlier the couple had won an incredible $7.5 million in Belmont.
The winning couple bet twenty years and said that the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th single winner of the lottery in Western Australia this year, winning a total of $85 million.
The trains of the Deutsche Bahn will not leave tonight.
Drivers want higher wages
In a press release, the GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it purposely chose time outside of the traffic peak.
At the chosen time of the strike, the GDL takes into account many people who return by rail from the weekend only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people commuting to work during the day," the union said in a statement Monday morning to declare a strike.
“Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers,” the GDL added.
The DB has not yet released an official response to the strike.
It is not even clear how the protest action will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a five percent increase in drivers’ wages and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of train drivers varies depending on the years worked between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1.27 million crowns) per year.
Engineers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to accept wage increases when working hours are shortened.
They point out that the salary valuation of the drivers must develop as well as that of other railway personnel, for whom DB does not count on the reduction of the working week.
There was a threat that Krest's car would start to burn.
That's why the Barum Rally ended
What exactly happened?
It was a material defect.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t think it would happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be temporarily repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to go straight there, yes.
But we were still waiting for two more heresies and that was not possible.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car starting to burn was high.
I can't afford that.
At full speed, you have passed five speed tests.
What was your impression of them?
Very good.
I felt like I was young.
We were fast, but I didn't drive through the vinyl.
Everything was caused by the fact that we dripped the car for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race showed that we did it.
You set him up so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
Work didn't come in vain.
On the other hand, the result that we could have thought of did not come.
But that's Barumka.
Unfortunately, the technology said no.
You weren't the only one who dropped out of the lead early.
Foreign favorites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also fell out of it.
Were you surprised that so many of your favorites left?
Oh, yeah.
It was a pity for the audience, because the race ended prematurely.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Tarabus was also at the top for a long time, for whom you are preparing a car.
But he paid to get off the track and pick up a two-minute drawback.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It's a shame, because he could repeat the stages of the winners.
It was the first second time.
But Mira also confirmed that the car was well-prepared.
He was driving very fast.
Exactly a year ago, you announced the end of your career, but you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of riding make you a regular participant in rally races again?
Not at the moment.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn’t keep it anyway.
I've decided to ride her again.
It was my 19th start here, and if there is a chance next year, I will probably go.
But I'm not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people just got to the track because of you.
Did you enjoy it?
To some extent, we started because of them.
A lot of people, familiar or unfamiliar, kept asking me if I was going.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after Barumka?
The team continues.
Next week we will go to Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn't hurt too much here.
In addition, he wants to borrow the Honza S<0xC3><0xBD>kora fabi from us for this race.
Mira and I are expecting a European double race in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you give me a hint?
No, nothing's decided.
When the Corsican Rally was in the World Championship, the fifth place you reached your peak in the series.
Don’t you want to try the tracks again?
He's not.
An oral agreement with an employer can be a problem
Unfortunately, you are not allowed to issue a certificate of incapacity for work from your doctor, which serves as evidence for the organization that you can not perform work duties for health reasons.
In addition, you did not immediately notify the employer of the absence.
Afterwards, there was an agreement that the days would be recorded as a holiday, but the agreement was only oral.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to have written confirmation of the employer's consent to the use of leave, in practice this procedure has been successful.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to take leave, as in your case, can be denied and the absence from work can be considered as a long-term unjustified absence, therefore the reason for the immediate termination of the employment relationship according to <0xC2><0xA7> 53 of the Labour Code.
In the event of a legal dispute with your employer, you lack evidence.
However, the employment relationship with you has not been canceled in accordance with <0xC2><0xA7> 53, only you have the days indicated in the credit card as an unexcused absence.
The unexcused absence in the bill of lading does not have the same consequences as <0xC2><0xA7> 53 (e.g. the inability to collect material security in unemployment), however, it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and have him/her confirm in writing that there was an accident that made you unable to work (this is not a so-called "incompetence", it is only a doctor's document).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate both the issuance of a written medical certificate of incapacity for work, as well as early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This way you avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart's accident on his way back to the track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just halfway through the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the fence a second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd round, and the race ended for him.
Stewart drove the wrecked car into the garage, didn't speak to reporters, and left.
Chad Johnston, the head of his team, said the team is disappointed but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia next weekend.
"I would like us to have better performance and a better conclusion," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and we're hoping we can do better there.
Stewart hit the fence for the first time in a Sunday night race after colliding with Kyle Busch, requiring repairs to the right side of his car.
"We were hoping for a good finish in today's race," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a race in New York, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and to do this he needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch up with a place in the table.
He returned to racing during an investigation into a tragic accident in which 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who drove Stewart into the road during the race.
Authorities said the investigation into the cause of the accident would take at least another two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he progressed to 10th and then even to 4.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car no.
18 got out of control, came out of the second corner and crashed into Stewart, sending both cars into the fence.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague selects new taxi service managers, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed tenders for the new manager of taxi stations.
For 103 parking spaces, he will receive approximately CZK 12.3 million per year.
Until recently, for the same places for drivers of taxis annually collected 150 thousand crowns.
This was reported by Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used lotteries in the selection of administrators.
The winner then received a lease for a lump sum of CZK 1000 per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently being decided.
“One year after the termination of the original leases and the opening of tenders, it has been proven that the new rental system is much more advantageous for Prague and, overall, fairer,” the councillors said.
The most expensive spot is On Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B>
The highest price was offered by those interested in the location in Na Per<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n<0xC4><0x9B> street.
He will pay 2.1 million crowns annually.
About 1.5 million crowns were paid by the new administrators for the seats in front of the Municipal House or on Wenceslas Square.
The new rules for the rental of taxi stations were adopted by the councilors in the autumn of 2012 and in the summer of last year they terminated the original lease agreements.
The selection process took place in four waves and the new administrator found 29 locations.
For the second time this year we had to clean the well.
We released it all the time, which created practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we poured Savo there.
Incredible smell!
Our well in the cellar always provided enough wonderful fragrant water.
And it wasn't professionally done, but Grandpa used his own tools.
A long time ago.
It was just for three rounds and overall peculiar, as everything in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, of course, we ran out of water.
When she stood there for months, she deserved it.
But even then, it seemed that the water didn’t smell.
We were wondering if something had fallen in there.
At the point where the pump was passing, it was possible with a little bit of bad luck, the plate was not quite lying there, so the hole was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lit it up to the bottom.
So we released it again and cleaned it up.
Of course, we have improved the improvised seals around the pump pipe.
We noticed some strange things in the basement.
There was a taped package on the ground with some cubes.
At least that's what it looked like.
And a little further.
Now it looked like a rattlesnake.
By the ceiling, in the places where there are vents, grandfather's invention, were the remains of fish!
And heavy jets!
Our cellar is also unique.
Some would say that Grandpa just buried the hut.
And he wouldn't be that far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are only suffocated sand, only the ceiling is submerged.
There are mainly boats.
And the car.
And sun loungers to the beach.
The door with the wide gaps was mostly open as someone walked in there at one time.
A few of the above-mentioned ceilings.
Without a net, so birds usually fly there and build nests on the beams.
There is no need to mention mice.
Grandpa wanted it to fly, and he did.
Now, of course, not even the lubricant helped.
The whole cellar smelled.
We cleaned the entire cellar.
Especially the fish on the beam was nutritious!
We also threw away things that were around: boards, heraclitus boards, and so on.
Our remote cottage welcomed passers-by with a disinfectant odor.
We were wondering, who could bring us the disgusting remains?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
She'd be hard to come to our place for a snack.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who wasn’t completely fine.
If he's the Franta, hasn't he snuck us through the air?
He's been here practically all year, stupid ideas, that's what he's got.
We decided to guard the cellar and well and check it regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
We started using the water again, so far only for washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was already good.
Pulling water from a forest well is nothing I'd like to do for a long time.
Once we heard a terrible, anxious barking of our bitch.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, strong black hose in the grass next to the porch.
Reza jumped over her, screaming like a madman.
My mom cheated on her because she thought Reza had dug the waste hose out of the sink.
Suddenly, the hose rolled up partly into the ball and partly straightened up.
There was a squeak on the balcony.
Reza had a hysterical seizure.
We ran downstairs.
A snout, long and thick as a bull, was about to swallow a giant toad, and Réza was preventing her from doing so.
It was not clear if she wanted to save the toad or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the excess in the form of our whole family, she must have said to eat it when we were hungry, and elegantly stretched herself through the air into the cellar.
We were flying after her.
Like lightning, she jumped into the well.
By the way, we recorded another stinking package on her record.
It smells like fish.
She wasn't there the other day!
Our new security around the pump was a little shady.
And we locked the cellar during the day.
That he would...
We went out, and there we all lay to one vent.
We didn't wait long.
It's a mess behind the well.
At first there was a flat head with yellow calves on the neck.
Then a whole loophole popped out of the well.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to dig in.
A sacked employee took revenge, bought laptops for the company and sold them
A grieving employee, after his release, bought computers for the company and then sold them.
He spent the money before the police were arrested.
Within a short time, the man bought a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns in twelve cases.
"After the takeover, he took the notebooks to Olomouc, where he sold them in bazaars," said Rostislav Brückner, the chief commissar of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk police.
The motive for the fraud was the employer’s revenge for the dismissal and also the profit of the money.
"He told us during the interrogation that he used the money to repay the loans," Brückner said.
The police also found out that the fraudster was a pathological player who was repeatedly treated in psychiatry.
The money could also end up in winning machines or video lottery terminals.
"The fact is that we didn't find any money from him," the commissioner said.
A fraudster who has already been punished for theft is now at risk of being imprisoned for one to five years.
Police have not yet said whether the bazaars, who bought and sold laptops under the price, are also facing punishment.
"It is true that they were taking over completely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners of the bazaar have yet been charged.
Come on, a little more, you can do it or how I enjoyed We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have prepared a few changes for us.
The biggest one was the change of route, which brought the destination to the naplavka instead of leading back to the Yellow Spa.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photos and made videos together.
In order to reach perfection from the other side, I accepted the role of a personal conductor.
Together with my friend K<0xC3><0xA1>tya, we were obediently placed at the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who passed us in the sector for faster runners.
There wasn't much time left.
A couple of jumpers to warm up, turn on the sportstesters, countdown and start!
Shouts of rejoicing, but instead of a quick start there was a sniffing to the starting line.
After five minutes, we reach the gate, turn on the measurement and run at a pace of ten.
We are intertwined with the yellow snake of runners who, like Katya, are running their first race.
Meanwhile, everyone looks fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the view of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad an almost kitschy touch.
The pulsating mass stretching along the waterfront looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
Traditionally, on the waterfront between Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad and the National Theatre, it begins to show who has how much power.
A light hill on Palackého Square forces many runners to slow down or walk.
Just before the crossing to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately after him V<0xC3><0xAD>tek Pavli<0xC5><0xA1>ta is flying at an incredible pace to his destination.
I hear the admirable groaning of the other runners.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he's going to slap me, but right before that, my leg gets torn and our hands just pass.
The reunion of the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathing.
It is necessary, in front of us are places where the views take my breath away.
The turn on the M<0xC3><0xA1>nes Bridge shows Prague in all the beauty of the setting sun.
I don't breathe, and my legs carry me almost alone.
Behind the first refreshment room comes the moment of truth.
When crossing the road, K<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA5>a <0xC5><0xA1>kobrt<0xC4><0x9B> by the curb and shows the jump floating.
I'm looking to see if she needs help, and I'm running a series of encouraging words so she doesn't have time to think about pain.
It rises and continues along the Goat Lane, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, at this stage of the race there is not such a rush, but it is necessary to monitor the surroundings well.
I do not yet know that the concept of the narrowest place will get its true meaning later.
Behind the Powder Gate we are encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud everyone who offers a hand, and I advise Katy as well, because ten applauses with fans is like half an energy stick.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have fallen quite significantly, now the chase has started.
We beat dozens of runners, when I pass someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: "Come, a little more, you can do it!"
After the last refreshment, no one's ahead of us, we're speeding up.
So far we have run for an hour and a quarter, we add, there is nothing to wait for.
Three miles to the finish line will hurt, but you really need to move.
The sun has already set slowly and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
Last run to the bridge, turn and just a straight line to the finish line.
The pace we're running is amazing, where does that girl go?
"Come on, we're under 13 o'clock, we're working!"
We're trying, we're sprinting, and there's a target.
Thirteen and six seconds.
Well, what can be done.
Coach set a time limit of 20 hours.
So seven minutes under the plan.
Which is a great result.
Just behind the goal, Katy's legs break, I help her to the railing, where she rests for a while.
It shows the exhaustion, but also the happiness of a well-performed performance.
After a while, I slowly take her out of the target space.
Euphoria does not allow us to think about the pressure in the passages to the dressing rooms.
Here you can see that Goat Lane was not the narrowest place.
It is only here that the target is a naplavka, which, under the pressure of almost ten thousand runners, is stuffed to burst.
If someone doesn’t like crowds, it’s not the place for them.
After a while, I also lose my mind and wonder if the beautiful views and compared to previous years, the more interesting route was worth what was happening at the destination.
I know from my own experience that running a race is no fun.
If ten thousand people are added to this, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire center of Prague for all transport, this is a huge challenge.
This year’s change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but it also brought some really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Spa was transferred between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators staged it on every meter of the track.
Unfortunately, when running in the city center, there are obstacles that cannot be removed, but I do not consider the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered by a wall on one side and a river on the other the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I see it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Write us in the discussion if you liked the route and what do you think about the situation at the destination.
Prison guards in Bulgaria organize protests
Hundreds of prison staff across Bulgaria attended a nationwide protest rally in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the reintroduction of the original working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on the list of demands to be discussed with Interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
The guards protested symbolically for a month against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards’ unions and Justice Ministry officials met, they did not agree, the Bulgarian National Radio (BNR) reported.
"Negotiations are still underway," Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the Directorate-General for Prison Service, told BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Union Organizations of Employees at the Ministry of the Interior are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why can the universe have multiple dimensions and we can’t see them?
Physicists usually don’t write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University managed to hit the black in 1999.
His book The Elegant Universe has become the most accessible way for laymen to penetrate the denseness of problems that many theoretical physicists are dealing with today – an attempt to unify two well-functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and the theory of general relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the fundamental problem between two key theories (in fact, at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) in such an imaginative way that it is worth retelling even to laymen.
In addition, Greene dealt with the complex material so freshly and engagingly that it is impossible to blame him for how much interesting he did not include in his book.
In addition, he corrected his "mistake" for the most part in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently, even the author would not object to his book becoming obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years, the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will still be a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), so it is a good time to enter Green's non-violently open doors to the world of modern physics.
How big can our universe be?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
However, it is concrete and completely acceptable.
In order to understand this, let us turn our eyes for a moment from the universe as a whole to something more ground-based, specifically to a long and thin garden hose for watering.
Imagine stretching a 100-meter garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole scenery from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the following page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long horizontally stretched hose, but if you do not suffer from clairvoyance, you can hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its great distance from the hose, you would think that an ant forced to live on the hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ant was at the time, you answer with only one information: the distance of the ant from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All we want to say is that from a half-kilometre distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose is thick.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see the second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that the ant can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the "dimension in/against the direction of movement of the clock hands", i.e. around the circular cross-section of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the position of a small ant you need to enter two numbers: how far from the end of the hose and where the circle wraps the hose.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (note that experts note that this chapter focuses purely on the fault theory of strings.
Non-disruptive aspects are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13.).
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the circumference, indicated by a circular arrow, is short and bent.
However, there is a clear difference between the two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size of the wrapping circumference of the hose is short, "twisted" and less noticeable.
To realize the existence of the circular dimension, we had to study the hose with a significantly better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
The fact that they are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, large, and therefore directly visible, or, on the contrary, small, bent, and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we didn't just skip ahead to reveal the "twisted" dimension wrapping the thickness of the hose.
I just needed a telescope to help me.
But if the hose had been thinner - like a hair or a capillary - we would have discovered the coiled dimension only with great effort.
In 1919, Kaluza sent Einstein an article in which he expressed the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions known to all of us.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by providing an elegant and convincing framework in which Einstein's general relativity and Maxwell's electromagnetic theory can be woven into a single, unified conceptual structure.
The question immediately arises as to how this Kaluza observation goes along with the obvious fact that we see precisely the three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly expressed and clarified by the Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and coiled dimensions.
This means that, like the dimension in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe has large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware of at every moment.
But analogously with the circular circumference of the garden hose, the universe can have additional dimensions, tightly folded into space so small that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluzov's remarkable design, let's stay with the hose for a while.
Imagine that on the circumference of the hose draw in black a fairly dense series of circles.
From a distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope, thanks to the drawing, we will now reveal the folded dimension even more easily, because we will see the motif from Figure 2.
We can clearly see that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but apart from one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, that is, four spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let us note the illustration in Fig. 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of space in the same way as we enlarge the surface of the hose.
Each subsequent level represents a huge increase in the geometry of space from the previous level.
Our universe can have additional dimensions (we see them on the fourth level of magnification) if they are folded into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not yet directly observed them.
A square grid represents the commonly known "big" dimensions, while a circle represents a new, tiny and coiled dimension.
Just like the thread loops in the densely woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - just for the sake of clarity, we have drawn them only in the intersections in the square mesh.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters,represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each picture below, we will focus on a small area of the previous image; we will zoom in to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we see at the first few levels of magnification.
However, as we advance on our way to the microscopic properties of the geometry of space further - to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3 - we see suddenly a new, circle-shaped, twisted dimension, similar to strings of thread in a densely woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, just as the hose has a circular circumference at every point of its length.
For the sake of clarity, we have mapped the circular dimension only in some regularly distributed points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluzov and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also notice important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-flung spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), while the hose has only one large dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, like our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the extra rounded dimension is extremely miniature, it is much more difficult to recognize it - like the circular circumference of the hose - than to observe the obvious, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the extra dimension is small enough, it will actually reveal it even beyond the strength of our most modern instruments for magnification.
Most importantly, however, the extra dimension is not just a rounded bump inside the normal dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration misleadingly suggests.
The circular dimension is a new dimension that exists at every point of the three common vast dimensions.
It is a dimension on the other three dimensions independent as well as the top-down, left-right and front-back dimensions independent (and perpendicular) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions, and to determine its position we would need four data, in addition to the usual three still a position in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then the data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price for the e-book is 149,- CZK.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that, although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluzov and Klein’s reasoning shows that this does not exclude the existence of additional folded dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe can have more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The state-of-the-art technical equipment can recognize the structures of a large billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Smaller folded dimensions can hardly be observed.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the newly emerging quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the extra circular dimension could be about the size of one Planck length, a size far beyond the distinctiveness of today's instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions Kaluzov-Klein theory.
Honza Homola advises on how to practice on an electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelve" lies in the twelve-digit harmonic form, which you can repeat arbitrarily.
Anyone who is interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Capsule (1976)
By educating the puppeteer and puppet guide, whose Facebook profile can be viewed here, he has been living as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is the guitarist of the band Wohnut, from which, unfortunately, he is not able to leave.
He is a guitarist after his father, as is his brother Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j, the leader of the Wohnuts.
Start training on one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, then just apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," advises Honza.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with a twelve-string harmony on two strings and how nice it is starting to sound.
If you pick up the third string, you can already flirt with the melody of some songs.
When you finally add a fourth, watch out for a change in tuning, Honza points out in the video.
Next time, Honza will return to the pentatonics and you will try to put it together with the twelve.
So practice it honestly.
As best as you can, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting?
It's not a big celebration, admits the Hradeck<0xC3><0xBD> Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k
We take a point and we are happy for it.
The first half we had more chances, the second home, "said the attacker, who this time scored from the penalty kick.
You weren't nervous when you played him, but he was accompanied by a huge whistling sound?
I didn’t see it in any particular way, although on the second goal, where there are home fans, it would probably be worse.
The penalty was equalized after half an hour, but you also got a goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What's the matter?
We fell asleep at the beginning, we were passive, a corner emerged from it and then a penalty.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were the better team, which had more chances.
Why did that change after the break?
Hard to say.
I agree that we played well after the collected goal until the break.
In the cabin, we thought we wanted to keep the pace of the game going, but we couldn’t.
To be honest, I can't even explain why.
But it is probably also true that the hosts said something about their game during the break, they were probably not very happy with it.
You have only scored the opponent for the first time on the field, while at home you may not have scored a goal yet.
Why is it so different?
I wouldn't say it's that much of a difference, but it's up to us how we deal with it.
We started well in Brno, but then it was bad from us, Pilsen, that’s another category.
Four matches you were waiting for the goal, were you not afraid that after the last match it could be similar?
Maybe not, but of course we are glad that from last match we do not need to talk about waiting for the goal.
Now we have added more without waiting, but there are still only three in six games, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from miles away crater.
Lava rising to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull Glacier flows through an underground tunnel from a crater miles away.
It is located under the glacier, as well as part of the mentioned underground lava tunnel.
This fact now worries scientists the most...
For now, the situation remains unchanged.
Since yesterday morning (31.8.
2014) still flies out of the fissure approximately the same amount of lava.
However, compared to the original estimates, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
2014 is up to 50 times bigger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open even in places where it is located under the ice.
If this were to happen, in addition to the intensity of the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökuls<0xC3><0xA1> <0xC3><0xA1> Fjöllum River and on other rivers.
There is a strong sulphur smell around the eruption, and clouds of steam and gases rise from the cracks.
This is definitely not an eruption suitable for tourism, as it was in the case of the Fimmvör<0xC3><0xB0>uhals eruption in 2010.
This is much bigger and there are also much more gases," says volcanologist <0xC3><0x81>rmann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved considerably since yesterday, with almost no wind in the morning.
The traces of the sandstorm were washed away by the rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (the second highest) applies to B<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB0>arbunga and the yellow grade (the third) to Askya.
The sky above Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked on the wings
Flying day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17, the acrobat Peggy Valentin was introduced, who climbed from the cockpit to the bar on the upper wing of the two-plane and also between the wings.
There, it relies only on the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held for the fifth time this year and the organizers managed to prepare several interesting air pieces again.
The premiere was held at the oldest Czech airport not only by the "walking on the wings" performed by the German acrobat Peggy Valentin, but also by the legendary P-51 D Mustang fighter or Beechcraft 18 aircraft.
He drew attention to himself with his glowing cover.
Acrobatics called Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to push through.
However, due to the high number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the air days program.
Peggy climbs out of the cockpit onto the upper wing after takeoff.
There he performs various exercises.
At the end of the performance, it will move into the space between the wings of the aircraft, where its show continues," Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Cheb Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day described.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband, Friedrich.
If Peggy's performance was the main highlight of the program, then the next performance of the Mustang was a famous cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the surface with the Grippens of the Army of the Czech Republic in hinges (so-called numbers).
This is the first time that fans of the Czech Republic have seen such a line-up.
The pilot Miroslav S<0xC3><0xA1>zavsk<0xC3><0xBD> then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatics with a plane from 1945.
It was built during the war, but probably never participated.
He was listed in the Army Reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civil sphere.
As well as a racing aircraft.
Today he has his own hangar at the airport in Munich.
In the same place is also another pearl of Cheb Air Day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, he didn't miss a huge machine.
His polished aluminium cover shone in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard in the colours of the French Air Force was also admired.
A small transport plane caught up with the renounced Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof to the air day.
The German neighbours demonstrated in Cheb with the reconstructed Yak 18T aircraft or the three-membered Bücker Jungmann twin-plane formation.
Lucie Borgyov<0xC3><0xA1>: Dramatic return to the camera!
Parental concerns were exchanged by Lucie Borgy, at least for tonight's work.
Stress or nervousness - the blonde moderator obviously knows none of this.
She was doing very well in the TV news, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months!
It is only two weeks since the blonde ended her six-week period, in which women experience the most stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly in the main news series of TV Nova.
A regular return awaits her, according to Blesk.cz information, only in a month.
Her daughter, Linda, needs her now more than the TV audience.
Lucie Borgy returned to the TV screen, and it was a hit in the black.
Exhibitions in Prague in a year?
The hall would sell out, plans a farewell Jagr
It would be nice if something like this were done during the World Cup.
But it depends on how the union stands up to it," he said in Jihlava after an exhibition called the Golden Match, in which a stunning Nagano team met again.
Even the players who participated in the Golden Hattrick.
Players have a taste, don't they?
I'm sure.
It would be good to say goodbye to the golden generation during the championship.
In my opinion, one can find one or two days during the tournament, when it is completely free and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiri <0xC5><0xA0>légro) or Be<0xC4><0x91>a <0xC5><0xA0><0xC4><0x8D>erban (organizer of the Jihlava match) who would take care of it...
The arena would sell out.
But what if you play with the New Jersey play-offs?
So when I fly in...
You don't want to play in the national team.
Or did the Jihlava meeting somehow change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things and in representation performances are decisive.
One thing is that people would like to see me there, but the performances are decisive, especially for the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed in any way.
How did you actually enjoy the Nagano reunion?
The meeting with the players was great.
The man revived the stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockey players.
But the most important thing was Ivan Hlinka’s honor.
And it’s good to remember the history of our hockey and the fact that there is a generation that is really worth it.
Slavom<0xC3><0xAD>r Lener, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r R<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ka and Petr <0xC4><0x8C>echm<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the inverter.
Can you remember your first national match?
You don't forget things like that.
It was against Calgary Flames and the three youngsters: me, Robert Hol<0xC3><0xAD>k and Robert Reichel, we were in the same trio.
For all of us, it was the first official start.
Well, that we would dominate in some way, that is not to say.
In Jihlava, Dominik Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was caught for a long time.
What did you say about his performance?
Hashanah will never surprise me on the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with the criticism, but I can not (Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek criticized Jager for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
The squirrel also did a great job.
You were training with me one night and there was a hole in it.
And now he was catching famously.
First the U.S. and then the Netherlands, footballers begin qualifying
Prominent guests gathered at the Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov NH Hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech from Chelsea, national coach Pavel Vrb...
And over there, the character in the black hat, that's Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>!
Arsenal midfielder and national team captain arrived at the meeting about half past twelve among the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who wouldn’t be happy?” he said, as he appeared in front of the press in the national team.
Czech national football team
Monday 1st September: start of the meeting, first training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open to fans (18:30, Letn<0xC3><0xA1>) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3rd September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Letn<0xC3><0xA1>)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Letn<0xC3><0xA1>) end of the meeting
Rosicky and Co. can support fans even before Wednesday's match against the United States (20:15).
The team opened for them Tuesday training, which starts at 18:30 at Letn<0xC3><0xA1>.
And it will be followed by an autograph show that neither Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> nor Czech will miss.
Otherwise, this national team meeting will be calmer.
Which is praised by coach Vrba, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
We will now focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things for which we have not had so much time so far," Vrba, who has been officially leading the national team since January, praised himself.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeer’s image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has three matches under Vrba, all preparatory.
Norway and Finland lost 2–2 and Austria lost 1–2.
However, these results were not yet important.
Not until now.
With the match against the Netherlands, the qualification for the European Championship 2016 will start.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it could also manage a general against the US.
The first half of the year was to get to know me.
Now the results are important.
We have to think about being successful," Vrba agreed.
The only player in the 23-man nomination who has health problems is David Lafata.
He's worried about the temperature.
If he hadn’t recovered by Wednesday’s match against the US, coach Vrba would have called another striker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
A British woman describes how, after a bad diagnosis, she thought she would die for many years.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking she only had a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth Syndrome (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that poor diagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can manifest symptoms in the area of motor skills such as muscle weakness, clumsy walking and twisted toes.
The affected may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, which means that over time the symptoms worsen.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich's Ataxia (FA), a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that by the time she celebrated her eighteenth birthday, she would be strapped to a wheelchair, and dead before she was thirty.
A mother of two, now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as the others.
Every day I fell and everything took longer.
I could never ride roller skates or skateboards with other kids, and I was bullied in school because of the way I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and had several surgeries to relax her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of her doctor’s departure from the room and looked into her records to learn that she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was spying, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I came home, I looked up information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” she says.
When they answered me, I was in shock, I panicked completely.
I thought that by the time I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and by the time I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my powers.
I was on my own and I was planning a funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she had expected, and she asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, "Honey, I don't think you have the disease, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now.
I think it will be something much less life-threatening.”
After undergoing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child," she said.
The charity CMT UK has launched a month of awareness of CMT to raise awareness of the disease.
Entrepreneurs in the Washington area: with the turnover of the economy, taxes are rising
A growing economy means more customers, more sales and more jobs.
And higher taxes too.
According to a new survey published last week, the state and local taxation of businesses in the country with the acceleration of the recovery of the economy grew slightly last year, and companies in Washington were no exception.
Businesses in Maryland and Virginia collectively contributed $27.6 billion to state and local treasuries in fiscal year 2013, up 3.8% from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
Tax burdens – both state and local – rose 4.3% to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9% last year, and were the third consecutive growth year after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were falling.
According to a study carried out by Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3% than local taxes, by 3.9%.
More than half of the county's tax revenues, 56%, are from trade tax, and 36% of Maryland's revenues are from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, has proportionally the lowest tax revenue from business.
The majority of growth in tax revenues comes from an increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which increased property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth of -1% by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from big states like California, New York and Texas, it seems the same situation is in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up 4.2% year-on-year from $9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value does not so much elevate state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where real estate tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For businesses in Virginia and D.C., property tax accounts for nearly half of state and local taxes.
“Maryland owns a lot of real estate companies, especially the tax base around D.C., the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenues cannot be attributed only to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business income also appears to be increasing.
Companies in the region have posted a $2.3 billion corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the most in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs is not growing as fast in these three places.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average, at 4.3%, while Maryland's growth was significantly higher, at 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, the tax increase was below average, to 4.1%.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of any of the three districts (all of which have the same tax rate) at 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the average D.C. remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxes and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
The D.C. study was not evaluated.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law cutting the corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, as did Virginia, and the tax will be reduced to 5% next year.
If the state continues to meet income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small businesses in Washington are doing better and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
Trade tax paid by small businesses as a personal income tax — a structure that compensates for cost increases by increasing the prices at which most businesses are organized — rose 20% last year to $2.4 billion in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia, much faster than other taxes.
Researchers say the trend and nationwide increase in trade tax is likely to continue next year, with total tax revenues from sales to state and local governments rising to 6.2% in the same period last year in the first three quarters of 2014.
But Washington may be lagging behind because cutting government spending is taxing the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's scissors
Will there be a new state in Ukraine?
Putin calls for talks on Novorossiysk
Russian President Vladimir Putin mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in southeastern Ukraine, where government forces have been clashing with pro-Russian insurgents since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions, they will have a difficult return to the Russian market.
According to him, the support provided to the West by the war of the Ukrainian army in the east of Ukraine is contrary to democratic values.
According to him, the end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so it cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
More sanctions on Russia?
The Czech Republic has claimed the right to disagree with the part
The European Commission, together with diplomats, is to propose a form of further tightening of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided last night.
This was told to journalists by the permanent chairman of the meetings of the member states Herman Van Rompuy.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals to shift the form of sanctions should be ready as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy to be replaced in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk was elected to the European Council at the European Union summit, the so-called EU president who heads the summits of member states.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
Catherine Ashton will be replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.
The Italian woman, who will thus become the vice-president of the future European Commission, has yet to be confirmed by the European Parliament in office.
Assisted death is a reality in the Czech Republic, only it is not talked about
Helping an incurable and long-suffering patient with death?
In Czech conditions, where the laws do not allow euthanasia, it is legally impossible.
Nevertheless, the statements of doctors who approached LN indicate that they hear about such requests.
ALS: The Hardest Chapter of Neurology, Says Doctor About Sclerosis
In the Czech Republic, about three hundred people suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), 21 patients undergo experimental treatment with stem cells in Motol, Prague.
We do not know 100% if it will be successful.
But if we don't try, we won't find out," says Radim Mazanec, a moth neurologist.
It's in the CIA's handwriting, they needed war, writes Huml about the downing of flight MH17
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD MP Stanislav Huml is clear about who shot down a Malaysian plane over Ukraine.
It is clear that “the harsh sanctions that were announced with regard to the downing of a civilian plane with almost 300 dead were deliberately caused by the Ukrainian army.”
According to the lawmaker, the CIA's handwriting is also known.
Unfulfilled promises.
Elections are approaching and parties are again offering the impossible
The end of the homeless on the streets, parking for each family and the cable car above Prague.
Before every election, it is repeated: the parties promise the impossible.
Also now, with the upcoming municipal elections, politicians are overtaking who will like voters more.
The server Lidovky.cz has selected unfulfilled promises from the present and the past.
70 years ago, the Czechoslovaks landed at Dunkerque.
A fierce siege began.
It was August 30, 1944, when the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka constantly asked for the addition of technical equipment and dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually complied and included this ground unit as one of their forces during the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the power of the German troops.
SUMMARY: Plze<0xC5><0x88> leads the league before Prague "S", Liberec declassified Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k
Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> is the new leader of the football league, which leads by a point ahead of both Prague "S".
Changes at the head of the table caused the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav.
After two defeats, Sparta recovered in the domestic league, thanks to two Lafat interventions, she defeated Jablonec.
The record win in the year was attributed to Liberec, who shot Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava 6:0.

How to survive the return from vacation?
Don’t rush anywhere and get some sleep.
The last days of the holidays are ahead of us.
Getting used to returning from a sunny beach or cottage at a normal working pace can be a nut for many.
It may even be accompanied by depression.
Fortunately, there are proven tips on how to cope with a changed situation: do not rush and indulge in quality sleep.
Joan Rivers' family: "We're keeping our fingers crossed"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since she was brought to a hospital in New York City, but her daughter has said she hasn’t lost hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover.
"Thank you for your greetings and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We're keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was brought to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call said she had suffered a cardiac arrest at a Yorkville endoscopy in the Upper East Side, the source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious”.
Reactions didn’t take long, including incredible online support from celebrities like Donald Trump, Montel Williams, and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is distorted by headlines
The fact that the media distorts reality with their headlines is (unfortunately) no news.
I know that headlines “sell” newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called “readers” who do not read anything else.
And that's a fact that's been bothering me a lot lately, it's more accurate than the word pisses me off.
This is particularly true of articles on the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
The headlines are “Israel has attacked Gaza.”
Only in the text will you read that the Israeli “attack” was a reaction to the rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often during the time of the declared ceasefire.
Then the headline "Both sides violated the ceasefire" appears.
Is the journalistic community aware that by doing so, it is directly involved in anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing across Europe (and not only there)?
It has not been sixty years since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived the Shoah.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted slogans of "Jewish pig" and similar persuasion, I was stunned.
Does the world want to finish what Hitler failed to do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that the Jews were destined to destroy the Slavs?
Ladies and gentlemen of the press, please take a little more care of your work.
You are often referred to as the “watchdogs of democracy.”
So defend her.
As long as he's here.
And defend the right of the only truly democratic state in the Middle East to protect its population.
How would you like our government to behave if one of our neighbours decided to destroy the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
Perhaps you should also realize one more fact.
Almost 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in the state of Israel.
And they're fine there.
If you ask them why they don’t go to “theirs,” like Gaza, they will answer you, why would they?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and high-quality healthcare (I have seen with my own eyes how Arabs usually go to the top private Hadassah Hospital, which is funded by sponsorships from Jews from all over the world, and are, of course, treated there).
Hamas is also attacking its Arab brothers with its missiles.
The only real help for Gaza, and thus for this troubled region, is to rid Hamas of it and disarm it.
And do not condemn Israel, though indirectly in the headlines.
Inform Hamas about its practices, its abuse of people as human shields.
Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel, at any cost.
Even at the cost of the deaths of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of the world’s terrorist organizations.
In nine years of self-government in Gaza, this area could have been thriving thanks to humanitarian aid from around the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity, for which, of course, the governors of Gaza do not pay and are even angry that power supplies are sometimes interrupted at this time.
Had Hamas not invested in the construction of underground tunnels so that self-destructive attackers could penetrate the territory of Israel, but, for example, in the construction of apartment buildings, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed a claim by Information on Monday morning: An online retailer - a producer of videos and hundreds of other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement came as a surprise, not because no one expected anyone to buy Twitch, but because YouTube was expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google for one billion seemed certain, and that connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago by Justin.tv, was set to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to stream online games to it – in the words of Business Insider, “YouTube for live gaming.”
The Twitch interface.
YouTube is already popular videos "Let's play", a kind where wise men (mostly older ones) give games processing Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to the fore when describing Twitch a lot, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn’t excite anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off possible competition.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t work out, even though the company was willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
All we have at our disposal is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shear: “We chose Amazon because it believes in our company, has the same values and long-term vision, and wants to help us fulfill it faster.”
Another mystery is – frankly – Twitch’s incredible success.
For snobs like me who claim to do sports rather than watch, it's hard to understand what's so amazing about watching games instead of just playing.
It’s one thing to watch a friend play Resident Evil over her shoulder at three in the morning, and it’s another thing to watch a stranger get 20 hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that a lot of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to control the perspective yourself is a pretty good recipe for getting a headache.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone isn’t a master of acting or humor, his Twitch channel probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth at the top of Internet traffic.
How will Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch meddling in Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
But Twitch has something every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men that advertisers want.
As Twitch CEO Shear said, Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games” and the media doesn’t seem to be shy, even as — swallowing — viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another Czech translation of the American atheist vlogger Aaron Ra.
This time on the theme "The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God."
The original video is attached.
The second fundamental lie of creationism is the belief that the sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers discuss one of the many things that are contrary to their religion, they often confront us with the question: Who will you believe?
God’s Word or the Word of Man?
It is as if human inquiry is utterly futile compared to the authority they imagine to have in their doctrine.
But when they say "man," they're talking about science.
And when they refer to the “word of God,” they refer to the myths about God written by humans.
If there really is an intelligent with a creator for any purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic formulas that correspond to it, and it must be he who added other series of evidence that point exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why else would all these things exist?
Looks like he's trying to tell us something!
Humans could not create any of these things.
But people can tell stories, tell stories.
And it was the people who wrote all those texts that pretended to be the word of God.
Every supposedly sacred teaching of any religion in the world describes itself as written by men, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favorite gods, or perhaps listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were not written by anyone but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and not gods at all.
If there really was one true god, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, the über-galactic supergenius, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a creature of this size ever wrote a book, there would be only one such book, a single scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, with no predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because the mere human authors would not be able to cope with such a work.
And people would not have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, supported by verifiable and true evidence, and would reveal a deep morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would constantly inspire every reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we would have expected nothing less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are constantly disintegrating into increasingly separate denominations, seeking contentious truths, and each claiming in some way divine guidance, regardless of the continuing divergence and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Koran, Bah<0xC3><0xA1>'u'll<0xC3><0xA1>h's Kit<0xC3><0xA1>b-i-Akd<0xC3><0xA1>s, Zarathustra's other Avesta, the Sikh Adi-Granth, the Mahabharata's Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be "the absolute truth" and "the true truth."
The only logical explanation is probably that to some extent everyone is on the wrong track.
None of the above books has any advantage over the others.
None of them have any evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I'm a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proved that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course not.
You still have to have faith.
All of them require faith and also apologies (defense), because they contain inconsistencies, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered to be true, which have already been overcome.
Therefore, it cannot be said that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them promote abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecy—with each also containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
Leading theologians admit that all the sacred texts of any religion were written by human hands and are therefore subject to interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thereby explaining many of the contradictions and inconsistencies in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I wouldn't call it a contradiction, but rather a mutual comment.
We must again point out that we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial revision.
He is right that Genesis has more than one author, and it is certainly not the story of an eyewitness!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. the five Books of Moses, and do not ascribe to Moses the authorship of any of them, since it almost certainly did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) of several mutually unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
The other documents were filtered at the same time and all are attributed to human authors.
The Bible is by no means as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druidic cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a Gnostic faith, followed by the Docets and the Ebionites and their completely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into some kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups, such as the Luciferians, were dispersed and discredited by further revisions of the Bible.
One of these administrations refers to King Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a major threat to the young Mosaic religion, the authors of the New Testament decided to ridicule and Ba'al Zebula, "The Lord on the Mount," changed to Beelzebub "The Lord of the Flies."
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently altered for both religious and political reasons.
The remainder of what became the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century C.E. in a series of commission decisions at the assembly in Nikaia.
Four Gospels were accepted, and sixteen others were rejected by a simple raising of the hand, as if the reality of a thing could be accepted or rejected by a vote.
The way the canon developed depended on what was read about Sundays in the Christian centers of the day.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
What about the Church of Rome at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same gospel stories.
Thus the core of the canon evolved from the closeness of the original Church.
So the Council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also consciously removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to books that had been approved.
Among the rejected items are the writings of both the apostles and the prophets.
Why should the word of God refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God were the real author of this random mix of legends, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was certainly written by humans, and certainly not too enlightened, but quite the contrary!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely wrong, whatever it is from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys can talk, believed in spells, blood sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, fiery potions, astrology and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod to spray blood on someone, it would cure the leprosy.
We're talking about people who thought that rabbits were ruminants and bats were birds and whales were fish and bee that's an integer.
These people believed that if they showed the pregnant cow striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone who knows anything about genetics say that?
Of course, the authors of this book did not know this.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the errors it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain absolutely nothing of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it fails completely because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by uneducated and bigoted savages, who ignored or promoted cruelty to animals, incest, slavery, slave abuse, abuse of family members, child abuse, child abuse, abortion, child abuse, and abortion.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing God's will.
However, creationists still ignore all of this.
Some of their websites admit that if any reality is contrary to the Bible, then reality must be ignored!
And why?
Because if creationists didn't have their beloved books, they wouldn't have a god.
In their world, one and the other are the same.
Ironically, they reject God’s “work” as “worship of creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and they even insist that the refutation of their supposedly "holy" books somehow refutes God as such.
Not their version of God, but all their versions of God.
Creationist Christians believe that if the Bible is wrong, God is lying.
They cannot accept that God could exist and the Bible could be wrong at the same time, because they cannot separate doctrine from deity.
So this is a kind of idolatry where believers worship human-made compilations as if these books were God himself, because they think they are HIS word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly "immutable word" of any god has been invented, compiled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often deliberately altered and distorted by mere erring people.

As she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts from the United Kingdom shouted, damaging her facial bone structure.
This bucket challenge didn't work out.
The woman was hospitalized after shouting at a bucket challenge by dislocating her jaw.
As she poured ice water on her head, Isabelle Roberts screamed so intensely that she damaged her facial bone structure.
"The water was so cold that I had to scream, but my jaw started to stiffen," she told The Mirror.

Chinese school shooter stabs nine people, three of them dead
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, broke into a primary school building this morning and attacked at about 11:30 a.m. local time.
Three of the nine people he stabbed later died in the hospital.
Chen then killed himself by jumping from a height, New China said, citing the regional government.
In recent years, China has experienced a series of similar attacks in schools and against children.
The public is therefore calling for greater safety measures and better protection of children in a country where many married couples have only one child in line with government policies.
Zeman showed the first children in L<0xC3><0xA1>ny how he had to sit in school
The youngest pupils were taken to their 9th grade class, where they and their teacher waited for the President to arrive.
He then showed the children how he had to sit alone in school.
"We had to sit with our hands behind our backs, fortunately that's not what's waiting for you, you're free people," Zeman told the children.
His wife then gave the first children as a gift to the puzzlers.

"This year I want to connect Czech education with Czech sport," one of the reasons why the first day of school went to the north of the Czech Republic explained.
The head of the school approached him at a hockey game in Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov.
"They were the first, so I accepted the invitation to participate in the beginning of the school year," the minister added.
Education Minister Marcel Chl<0xC3><0xA1>dek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) started the school year at a private sports school in Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov.
This year, 115,000 first-graders entered the first classes.
A total of more than 850,000 children will attend primary schools and over 405,000 students will be educated in secondary schools, the Ministry of Education estimates.

Apple's iCloud reportedly succumbed to hackers, nude photos of celebrities made public
Screenshot with a list of leaked files
So far, an anonymous user has posted nude and pornographic pictures of American celebrities on 4chan, Mashable.com reported.
They were allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic image backups from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as falsified, but several of those affected have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known from the title role of Katniss in the film series Hunger Games, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who played for example in Death Trap 4.0.
The goal of the hacker is to use the obtained images and videos for enrichment.
According to reports on 4chan, the hacker prefers money from the community.
According to The Next Web, this is very likely a vulnerability in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that allowed users to obtain passwords to their accounts through brute force, which is the automatic repetition of attempts to log in with different passwords.
The tool was proven to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
However, it is certain that potential attackers had plenty of time to gain access to various accounts before the release of this tool.
iCloud users should therefore change their Apple ID-related password for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
A minimum of 12 characters is appropriate.
The escape of nude images of celebrities is considered as a reminder of the safe use of online services.
While the servers of companies like Apple, Google, or Microsoft are many times better secured than home or small business computers, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
Thus, you will be able to move sensitive images "to safety" in time, and most importantly, you will have space to delete failed images, so that they will not take up space in the online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communication on the Internet, we offer readers of HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Val<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>ek in PDF format.
Smart Way to Save for College Scripts
Given that the price for a college script for many students exceeds $1,000 per year, the upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He devised a system for lending books from high school classmates, offering nominal compensation to delay their sale back.
“The book of calculations, which normally costs $180, I got for ten a semester and chicken nuggets,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He lost 120.
According to the University Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and aids, but students have different options for coping with these expenses.
Online stores and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s become the preferred choice of students.
The lending of textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use the book for a semester, often at a significant discount than if they had bought it.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says that book lending has doubled since 2011.
A survey in the sector shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed last spring, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Online Shopping
The prices of some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in a university bookstore.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of the book “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but it can be purchased online at Chegg.com, a textbook retailer, for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don’t mind other people’s notes or wear and tear, the textbooks used are a good option.
On Chegg.com, "Calculus" sells for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents for a used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business” on Amazon.com.
The new one sold for $48.
University lecturer Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers to see if older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not essential for working in seminars.
If so, older editions may be sold at a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc’s Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
Borrowing
It is also worth considering borrowing textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the end of the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on the cost of a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about twenty dollars for the entire semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the store where you borrow your book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and tear.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book in time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-books
Another option is to buy an e-book instead of a normal book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows Calculus for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, students of literary courses can find the best deals because many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to the shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon be attending Pepperdine Law School, recommends following the ISBN because it guarantees that you are buying the right book.
Before ordering a book online, make sure it’s really in stock, Gault advises.
He made sure of it on his own.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Mud, all mud.
And then they found the torso rifles from the end of the war in the well
The well is a short walk from St. George's Church.
We discovered the vegetation around it and started pulling out a year-old debris - about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
As we approached the clay floor, we came across a barrel," Radomir Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
We pulled it out, cleaned it up, and found out it was the torso of an attacking German rifle used by the SS.
The finding is said to be unusual.
According to my information, such rifles were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand of them," Novak added.
All wooden construction things have decomposed over time, so it is useless.
But her body is preserved - she keeps her shape.
How did it end up in the well?
There is one explanation.
Maybe it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by SS units, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
The fascists on the run probably wouldn't do that.
They were throwing guns in the woods," the finder thinks.
The rifle was the only thing the fans of the Rainbow Movement found in the well.
"There could have been hand grenades, there were a lot of them around here, so we slowed down the excavation work, carefully scrutinized the mud so that there was no misfortune, but there was nothing else down there," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k said.
The find will end up in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltice.
Ukrainian general: I have not yet liberated the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who frees Ukrainian soldiers from the capture of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "I'm sorry, I have to take it ... they're calling me from Donetsk," Ukrainian Colonel-General Volodymyr Ruban, who is also the director of the Center for the Liberation of Prisoners of War, apologized eight times in an exclusive interview with Aktualno.cz.
Colonel General Vladimir Ruban in the TV debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of the people, their numbers, or the places where they were - or should be - that Ruban specified with his counterpart at the other end of the phone.
'That's it - go there, 'he concluded one of the lightning discussions with Donetsk and again devoted himself to ours.
Volodymyr Ruban is a reserve general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Even yesterday - when we arranged an interview - he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that the Czechs are fighting on the side of the pro-Russian separatists.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
Of course, there can be many more.
Have you ever met a Czech prisoner in your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated already captured Serbs, Daghestanians, Chechens, one Swede, a Georgian... but not yet a Czech.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we run into your captured compatriot and can free him.
Ukrainian Soldier Captured by Separatists
A.cz: What advice do you give to the Czechs who join the pro-Russian separatists and are captured by Ukrainian soldiers?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and the separatists capture them, they will shoot them without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
The Separatists regard these men as hired mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists - and among them, for example, a Czech - then they put him in jail and treat him like a prisoner of war.
The guy's just gonna survive.
The Ukrainian side also behaves like a state in the war.
A.C.: And how many of you have managed to save Ukrainian prisoners?
If I understand that correctly, it's in exchange.
Some sources say that it has long exceeded a hundred men.
We have long since stopped counting how many people we have helped.
But we have only freed them... not saved them from the war if they choose to continue fighting.
Rescuers are doctors, surgeons, but we certainly are not.
That's it.
Every day there are more and more.
We save someone every day.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It doesn’t always have to be an exchange.
Sometimes it is enough to release the prisoners even a mere human plea.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... as well as in Ukrainian society.
How did you manage to build respect on both sides of the war?
That's a tough question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "crazy general with steel balls".
It doesn't offend me.
And maybe it also describes the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian officer corps, I have gained some of that authority before.
I never cheat, cheat, and always keep my word.
No matter what happens, I'm honest and telling the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or for the Donetsk or Lugansk government.
What if they torture and kill people?
So I just tell them they're being tortured and killed.
And that they are crimes.
I often risk my life, even being taken prisoner in exchange... this job can mean the end for me at any time... I don't have to go back.
A.C.: How many executions and tortures of prisoners do you know?
Ukrainians and separatists resort to the torture of prisoners during interrogations.
I'm sorry.
And the executions?
This is only happening on the Donetsk side.
The fact that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners, I have no information.
There are no indications that the Ukrainian military is doing anything similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to state the numbers.
A.cz: Describe to me the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are officers, but also veterans from Afghanistan.
They are trying to gain independence and maybe even democracy in Donetsk or Lugansk - that's what they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
The separatists are already fed up with the oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents – to life and death.
As we say, they ate them all the way down the throat.
By the way, the same dreams and desires were manifested on the Maidan.
And now I'm speculating a little bit: Russia is supporting the separatists and the West is supporting the Ukrainian state.
I consider one speculation to be large and the other to be small.
But this sentence of mine already contains an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: What do you think, for example, of one of the toughest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists, Igor Bezler?
Every time I cross the line of the war front, I am unarmed and show the soldiers or armed men my bare hands.
And I always have both sides of the two hundred or three hundred meters on the fly or in the optical sight.
Those faces of the people who are pointing at me, I can always see well... and they can pull the trigger of their weapons at any time.
A paratrooper, an experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself a Russian officer, but his family - his mother - lives in Ukraine.
He believes that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, then only as a small province in the great Russian empire.
In any case, he is constantly talking about it and considers Ukraine to be some kind of misunderstanding that has arisen.
Such a state should not even exist.
At the same time, he is the irreconcilable enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: Speaking of characters – in the Ukrainian television news show you called your Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do his best if he left quickly.
For those three hundred meters walk, I always get at least five times the fear.
Why, then, should I hide my opinion that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
A.C.: Do you think he has a stake in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that Ukrainians call Yatsenyuk “the rabbit”.
And the rabbit in the eyes of Ukrainians is not an animal that would be feared or would have the respect and authority of others.
His behavior directly copies the behavior of the rabbit.
He may be a good economist, but as prime minister, he has no right to cry in parliament, to beg him, to play his intrigues with him, to threaten to take office... he must run the country, manage it, and protect it in times of war.
When the country is threatened, the Prime Minister does not have the right to family, friends, rest for crying emotions.
He is the first minister of Ukraine.
And Yatsenyuk?
She acts like a puberty girl.
Yes, he is tired, but also weak, because he was never strong... he is not fighting for Ukraine, he is just constantly complaining about everything.
That's why he should leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Failed to Save Sales
Sylvester Stallone’s needy three returned less than $30 million from the $90 million U.S. budget, and Sin City: The Woman for whom I would kill returned only $12 million from the $70 million budget.
The film Sex Tape with Cameron Diaz earned just $14.6 million over the first weekend, and children's films such as How to Train Your Dragon 2 were disappointing to the cinema.
According to an article by film critic Robbie Collin in The Telegraph, the quality of children's films is to blame.
Collin described 2014 as the "worst" year of children's films, and called How to Train Your Dragon 2 a mere "functional" sequel.
When it comes to films deployed to a slightly older target group, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared CinemaScore and Metacritic with their average ratings of summer movie premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 theaters between War Victims Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinions of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is of similar quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the blame may be a change in the attitude of viewers and the higher popularity of Internet servers like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s elaboration of The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We have to admit it and not try to chase after what was already there.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood cash-straps, Netflix’s net worth is $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book rights and predicted the “collapse” of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that there may be something to his catastrophic prophecy.
With the release of possible major box office blockbusters in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Mimo<0xC5><0x88> and Jurassic World, other numbers are more optimistic in the film industry.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the decline in sales as simply “cyclical.” For the Hollywood Reporter, he said: “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash-straps in history and no one will worry about selling.”
North Korea threatens Seoul again, launches another short-range missile
North Korea has launched another short-range missile into the sea, Seoul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of joint military maneuvers between the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for an invasion.
Chagang Province is located in the northwest of the KDLR near the Chinese border.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a location in the northwest of the DPRK and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea may have launched a missile from Chagang province for the first time, South Korean media reported, citing military circles.
There is an underground launch pad for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another of a series of similar tests that the isolated North Korean regime has carried out in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, protests against the NATO summit in Newport took place.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in downtown Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to Cardiff City Hall for a meeting that was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough monitored the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who had arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenage boys had to be transported from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending a night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a Sunday afternoon hike to Govetts Leap in Blackheath.
When they did not return home, the concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search party, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched, and the pair were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and hit his head.
The officers stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
In a stable condition, they were transported by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
Olomouc brought only a point from Opava, Vash<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek had a win on his leg
It was the 23-year-old forvard who could decide, but failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal, the main call was a close shot three minutes before the end, but the place in the net ended up on the goalkeeper of Opava Josef Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
I had it on my feet, I have to give it a chance.
I'm angry with myself," your ashes scattered on his head.
"I guess I should have put it under the lid, it got a little bit off," he thought.
Sigma's defense did not allow Opava much, except for Mikulov's 11th minute attack, which was covered by Reichl.
Then they began to push Han<0xC3><0xA1>cs, but in the block defending the home they did not let them in, and the missiles were caught from a distance by Kv<0xC4><0x9B>to<0xC5><0x88>.
Fifteen minutes of comparison, then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were already better, we had more from the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not change the set chance, so it ended 0-0," said coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda.
Opava also took a point due to absences in the squad, where, in addition to the two injured, Petr Vav<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k and three-goal shooter Petr <0xC5><0xA0>ev<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are visiting from Sigma in Silesia, were also missing.
Unlike their previous policies, they were not allowed to enter.
Substitutes deserve discharge.
Sigma was more footballing, but apart from one standard, we didn’t let it do anything,” said Slezan<0xC3><0xB3>w coach Petr Bar<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggressiveness and combativeness.
The draw is probably well-deserved, the point is a decent profit for us,” he added.
Sigma scored four points in a draw, which means 13th place.
Nothing that could satisfy club boss Josef Léber, who after defeating Znojmo conditioned his millionth deposit in the box office with diametrically different performances in subsequent matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lébro's warning, so there can be no talk of the boys not wanting to fight," Kalvod observed, and added to the sleeping shooter's address, "I believe it will come and when he scores, it will begin to fall on him.
But after the first shot, I will immediately replace him, so that he can save goals for the next matches," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has impressed Venice twice.
The film industry is experiencing a crisis.
After a huge enthusiasm for the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez In<0xC3><0xA1>rritu suddenly ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the following days indicated the impression that interest in the 71st edition of the festival in Venice has dropped somewhat.
Either because the number of seats in the largest hall has increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critically acclaimed, but for viewers less attractive, films such as the documentary about the genocide in Indonesia in the 1960s, Watching the Silence and other social-themed films from American 99 homes to Iranian Povidas.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace has not yet occupied such crowds as in the past and allegedly ceased to be a problem to find a place in the hotel at the last minute.
The crisis is more talked about in Italy than elsewhere, and it is no wonder that it has affected even such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but they are present exclusively in connection with films.
While younger fans longed for the autographs of the comic book superheroes Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who were quite successful in their 99 homes, the main event for all generations was the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
He also starred in two films.
In the story Out-of-Competition, directed by Oscar-winning Barry Levison based on Philip Roth's novel, the 47-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to his heart: an actor at the height of his fame, suffering from depression at the end of his career and personal life.
But to see him the next day as the strange owner of a hardware store from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, filmed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
The Volpi Cup for Best Actress shouldn’t miss it – but does the Pacino format artist still need the prizes?
Perhaps the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, especially the Italian one, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
The Italian film is doing very well in Venice this year.
The Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became Birdman’s first film to be rewarded with a long standing applause.
The Calabrian branch of the mafia is seen in it by looking at the family relations between clans that fight for power and money, and the director was able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a high-quality script, a camera, music and actors.
He was also fascinated by the chamber psychothriller Hungry Hearts, which was filmed by Saverio Costanzo and Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who with her wandering anxiety almost killed her own child.
Conversely, the French competition films did not receive a warm reception, nor the Ransom for Glory, nor 3 hearts, both works sticking to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of actors.
But after all, two really great films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so little for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival shots have generally depressing themes, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film She’s Funny That Way, a funny comedy out of competition in Venice and shot in the style of American cheerleaders in the 1940s, has managed to lift the mood for more than one day.
Police caught four pervitin producers in Prague, drugs were brought from Poland
"Detectives have arrested three men, aged 42, 42 and 37, and a 25-year-old woman, who produced and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9 from November last year to August this year," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said in a statement.
First, on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Cihl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> Street caught a 42-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman who appeared in the group as a drug buyer in Poland and a saleswoman of benefits.
The next day, the detectives arrested another member of the group, a 37-year-old man, on the basis of the prior consent of the prosecutor.
The last of the four police officers were arrested in the area of the Mala<0xC5><0xA1>ice incinerator on Wednesday morning of August 20," the spokeswoman said.
For transporting drugs from Poland, a woman received a third of the drug
The main organizer had a wide field of action.
In the workshop of the summer resort, in the garden house in Horom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, in the apartment in Kon<0xC4><0x9B>vova street and in other places in Prague 9, he produced pervitin, supplied various tools and chemicals necessary for its production and ensured the transport of medicines with pseudoephedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags, and then sold the pervitin.
He was helped by a 25-year-old woman who had not yet been punished by drug trafficking from Poland or by selling drugs to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
The criminals also carried out several house searches on the order of the judge, where they secured the drug, industrial chemicals, digital scales, pay bags, syringes, hoses and other devices and objects, which according to experts can be considered complete equipment for the production of methamphetamine.
Dealer Has Been Sentenced Seven Times Since 1995
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer has been sentenced seven times for property crime since 1995, the woman was not punished in court," the police spokeswoman added.
The last person arrested was sentenced to probation for sexual abuse in 2006, and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who has been prosecuted on the loose, has been sentenced nine times since 2009.
It was mostly a property crime, too.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they face up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three persons, the investigator finally submitted a motion to the Prosecutor’s Office for the imposition of detention, where the judge eventually placed them,” the spokesperson said.
The fourth defendant, a 37-year-old recidivist, was freed.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other defendants.
The police are still working with this man.

Disruption of high schools and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people, and statistics show that high school students have a good practice.
The beginning of the school year is here.
There have been a lot of preparations in schools in the last 14 days.
These are usually routine matters, such as moving pots from summer storage back to classrooms and stuffing chalk.
They're going to have a little bit more frmol at the Gorizia gymnasium.
A few days before the start of the season, they are looking for furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature in the library.
There was no robbery or embezzlement, the four-year high school in Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice after three years opens and resumes its activities.
Not on a public platform, but on a private platform.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders are so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering it in the register of schools managed by the Ministry of Education.
“The French socialists should shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande.
Valls calls on the heavily fragmented left to "show its support" to the militant socialist president, whose new division of office was not met with the consent of the majority of the French.
The president deserves universal respect, he deserves loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said, reaping an applause.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not question France’s controversial 35-hour work week, despite passionate speculation from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister, who proposed earlier this week that the rules be relaxed.
On Saturday, Hollande asked the Socialists to remain “cohesive” with the government.
But Christiane Taubir, the justice minister, made a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for having “lost the French faith in the future” because of her.
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the ultra-conservative right, laughed at the constant internal disputes among the socialists when she declared that she did not expect the new Valls government to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked, and Prince Manuel Valls is naked, and they were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
"And the new one won't last until the end of autumn or winter," Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament and stated that she was convinced that it could win early elections and that she was ready to lead the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the March municipal elections, and in May the ultra-conservative right won the European Parliament elections.
According to a poll by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before Hollande’s term ends in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French will soon run out of patience if the new socialist government fails to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“It’s a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there is a change in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art Prague will no longer be restricted to elections
Changes to the relevant decrees should be prepared and approved only by the new leadership of the capital.
Before the municipal elections, other playrooms will not disappear from the streets of Prague, and the city will not restrict street art.
There will also be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not have time to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees before the October elections.
"Moreover, the decision on the changes should not be made by the current leadership of the city, which ends its mandate in a few weeks," said Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Manhart (TOP 09).
In recent weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish gambling on their territory.
But the game will not disappear, the gambling decree will not change yet.
This is the task of the new city leadership after the elections.
Now we wouldn’t even be able to do it technically, given, for example, the deadlines for submitting comments and the like,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current parliament, which must approve the amendment of the decree, will take place on 11 September.
On the day of municipal elections, the municipal districts of Prague 1 and Prague 8 are preparing a referendum on the ban on gambling.
Currently, there is a ban on gambling, for example in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change even in the case of street art, so-called busking.
Prague 1 is complaining about this, which has already sent a proposal of places to the magistrate, which it would like to expand the current list of prohibited places.
The musicians also do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of And<0xC4><0x9B>l.
A decree regulating the outing of dogs is being prepared by the city for several months, but it has not been completed yet.
The location of the games and the issue of busking is addressed by city decrees.
They may be issued or modified only by the City Council.
Town halls have only an advisory vote, they are not allowed to issue decrees themselves.
Last week, he placed a victory for the proponents of Scottish independence at your fingertips.
The campaign for Scottish independence was in danger of making that mistake a third time when it nearly put on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won’t get to the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallets, nor will you gain their respect when you threaten them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still go to church today.
The Scots have a far greater tendency to drive the money changers out of the temple than to let them dictate how they should vote.
The head of the Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, so he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, in a televised discussion whether he was willing to respect the “sovereign will of the Scottish people” if Scottish voters voted for independence and start supporting the single currency for Scotland and England.
This forced Darling to choose between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and with a grimace he fell into this trap.
Of course, Darling will not support the mandate of the Scottish electorate.
However, the debate about what kind of currency Scotland will have has already been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is the fairness, job opportunities and defense of public health that citizens have for free.
Darling backed the London bankers on the currency issue and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of health care.
As Salmond put it, "he went to bed with the Conservatives."
This is a very dangerous position for any Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the Unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent homemaker.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.
At least Cameron was able to say that Scotland could be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can't say anything like that, it causes him almost physical pain.
What he says is clear: Scots should not jump out and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.

Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Urban Longest year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that was no longer going anywhere and we just rolled around and swam with grandma in the summer, silence before the storm, calm before the stress.
New clothes, when it was possible to get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading Fast Arrows, for the fiftieth time, whistling on a bike up the hill around the Imperial to the back of the Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, was no longer hot, the sun was slicking back and shoulders, tapping the farewell beams.
In the evening, a slight nervousness, still a holiday regime, sleep until half past eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before falling asleep stretch from a few minutes to two hours, and in the morning get up at half past seven.
It's Monday.
It usually doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer is malignantly grunting in front of the school.
To fit in the ghostly light on a piece and feel like a plastic figure in a glass mine, there is the school, ZD<0xC5><0xA0> A.
Z<0xC3><0xA1>potock<0xC3><0xBD> with monstrous pink plaster, and in front of her old familiar faces and a few new ones, boys more elongated, girls more busty.
There are bad guys out there, avoiding them, it's just as interesting how infallibly they stick together and how early they're here.
And these grown-up-looking girls, who came screaming, are laughing hysterically now, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same with me.
And again, new first-timers, some nervous and other delights, why do they even come here?
Because they have to, they have to have an educational war.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the slight smell of disinfection, the poisoned janitor with the mops, unfortunately still the same thing that supposedly lends the pupil the key to the tin box, where they can leave the textbooks, and there are still so few of them.
For the bottle.
The smell of the dressing room remains in memory, now it is not done, it is nicely ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It's only from that idea that the stomach clamps and the head starts to hurt.
A head that understands mathematics even worse, that diabolical game for the elect, among whom I do not belong and will never belong.
Again, the threes and fours, God forbid the fives, hide from rehearsal, fit into the bench and best sublime, be there and not be, exist only as a name in the classroom and dream of stories about nicer girls and more beautiful buildings, about antennas to space, where no one with no one, no one with difficulty.
The longest year is 10 months.
And it's only the first day, now as it was years ago.
She left her daughters to die.
She is facing an extraordinary punishment - News.cz
The first birth took place in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, a little girl was born to her, and after she had cut her umbilical cord, she wrapped it in a ready-made blanket, hid it under her jacket, and carried it to a roadside runner, where she put it in shrubs located a few tens of meters from the road.
She gave birth on the way to school
It came to me a little early.
I was on my way to school.
On the bus, I needed to go to the toilet, there I gave birth.
She was born alive, looking at me.
I cut my umbilical cord with the scissors I was wearing to school,” the defendant said, adding that she was ashamed of her pregnancy.
"The next day she returned to her place, put the body of the child in her backpack and drove it away, removed the body from her backpack, wrapped it in a black plastic bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother's house in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Brod," the lawsuit states, noting that it is not entirely obvious when the newborn died.
It could be tens of minutes, but also hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or when placed under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an untied umbilical cord.
A similar scenario was repeated next year in the spring.
A woman in the unidentified period from February to April 12, when the corpse of the child was found by random witnesses under a bush near a pond in Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kobrodsk, gave birth to herself again secretly.
This time in the bathroom of an attic apartment in a family house.
Without verifying that she was born alive, without cutting and tying the umbilical cord, which was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic cases, including a plastic bag, and left it in the bathroom.
In the afternoon, he and his partner were taken to the pond.
Finally, a friend gave it up.
The father of both children was a friend of the defendant, who allegedly did not know about the pregnancy of the partner.
Even for this reason, he is not currently on trial, he has only been punished for an offence against the Funeral Law.
He was also the one who later turned to the police.
I don't like him being punished as an accomplice.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know my solution wasn't right, but it seemed humane at the time," the defendant, who was supposedly in a relationship with the man and feared him, said.
During her testimony, the young woman spoke fairly evenly.
Tears came to her eyes when she talked about her relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She said she didn't want to kill.
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn’t buy the equipment because I didn’t want the kids, I felt young.
I still wanted to put it in the baby box, but I don't know what happened that I didn't do that.
“I can’t explain that,” the judge answered.
However, she refused to act with the intention of killing the newborn.
The second child, she said, was born dead.
Even during pregnancy, she did not stop drinking alcohol.
But I limited it.
And she didn't drink hard.
I have also reduced smoking,” he said.
Although her pregnancy was visible in both cases, she claimed that she had health problems, that she was watered.
Even a friend.
The trial will continue at the court in Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové on Tuesday with the testimony of court experts.
A verdict could be handed down on Wednesday.
A woman is at risk of a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional penalty.
Norwegian Cruise closes three-billion-dollar acquisition of Prestige Cruise
According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world’s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced in negotiating the purchase of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.
The deal by Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion company that competes with the larger rivals Royal Carrebian Cruises s.r.o. (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N), gives access to luxury Prestige Cruises cruise ships and wealthy clients.
The deal could be announced as early as this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that the talks still may not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment company of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not wish to be named because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo refused to comment on the situation.
Based in Miami, Norwegian Cruise operates thirteen cruise ships on cruises in North America, the Mediterranean Sea and the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
The company’s revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13% from 2012.
Prestige Cruises operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships sailing to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
The company reported sales of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6% year-on-year.
The $29 billion cruise segment is expected to benefit from the rise of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India over the coming year.
Companies compete to become the preferred option for these customers when choosing cruises.
Prestige Cruises registered its first public offering with U.S. regulators in January 2014.
Apollo has held a majority stake in the company since 2007 since closing a $850 million deal.
Norwegian Cruise has existed in its current form since 2000, when it merged with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a consortium of leisure businesses and casinos controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise listed its shares on the stock exchange in January 2013.
According to the registration with the regulatory authorities, at the end of June, Genting owned a 28% equity stake, Apollo 20% and the private investment company TPG Capital LP 8%.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82% of North American passengers.
Pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote
A group of people loyal to Beijing, waving the Chinese flag, stood nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Sunday approved that only two of the three candidates will participate in the 2017 elections in Hong Kong.
All candidates must first obtain the support of an appointing committee, which is likely to consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get on the ballots and get pro-democracy activists to renew the promise and cripple Hong Kong’s financial center with the protests of the “Occupy Central” movement.
In Hong Kong, political reform is the main reason for tensions, with Chinese leaders fearing that the demand for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing published a detailed report outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business district and occupied it.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
During the day, the Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission Zhang Ronghsun and the Deputy Director of the State Council of Hong Kong and Macau Feng Wei were also to speak at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government’s office this afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin urges Kiev to start talks on “state sovereignty” with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the “state sovereignty” of the detached areas.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later explained that Putin’s remarks did not intend to imply that the separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be reassessed so that the Russian-speaking region would have the power to protect its rights and interests.
Putin’s call on the Kiev government to treat pro-Russian insurgents as equals corresponds to an obvious strategy that has been in place since the riots broke out five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly-proclaimed Novorossiya de facto independence so that instead of joining with the West it can join with Russia.
In an interview with the first channel of state television, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military actions to recapture the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have called the newly occupied territory “Novorussia” or “New Russia,” a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russia’s Itar-Tass news agency published Putin’s words that “the prisoner is an illusion” for anyone who believes peace talks are on the horizon, as Ukrainian politicians launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government troops attack civilians in separatist-controlled areas.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and on the status of state sovereignty of southeastern Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to state sovereignty was meant in the context of broader autonomy, which has been under discussion with Kiev’s leadership for several months and is intended to alleviate concerns of Russian-speaking areas over threats to cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention, which was supposed to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks, highlighted the Russian leadership’s approach to resolving the separatist insurgency in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where the majority of the two-million-strong population is ethnically Russian.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million population are not Russians, and opinion polls conducted before the conflict have shown widespread support for Ukraine’s stay.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea Peninsula, annexed five months ago, is home to Russia’s main naval fleet, maritime trading facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Rostov and Crimea are also the center of mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inaugural speech on June 7, proposed that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections - consider constitutional changes that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language statutes.
However, this vision of autonomy differs significantly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists, and Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to treat separatists as equals followed the insurgents’ next move last week after Russian troops and tanks penetrated eastern Ukraine from a formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.
Separatists reinforced by the Russians have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea.
This accelerated a huge civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a port with metallurgical combinations of 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean Peninsula.
Poroshenko, speaking at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, called for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has been independent for the past 23 years.
"We are approaching a point from which there is no return," Poroshenko warned.
There are now thousands of foreign military units and hundreds of foreign tanks on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit has not taken any definitive steps - leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for Ukraine’s National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of the 63 reported Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion was exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago in the Ukrainian interior, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Greece are also involved in the scandal with the unveiled photos
Geoffrey Edelsten expressed his disgust at the hackers who probably stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Greece and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet in the biggest celebrity hacking scandal.
The hacker claims to have 60 nude photos of Hunger Games star Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The leak also reportedly brought to the public personal images of Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and the Melbourne-based actress Greece.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who proposed to Greece last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, according to online newspaper reports, said the hacking was “unashamed” and those who became its target “feels humiliated”.
The hacker is believed to have obtained 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two of the photos he took at the top of the pool without crashing.
Palmer starred in the film Love and Honor, where her counterpart was Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the television series Chuck Strahovski and actress from the thriller Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen footage yesterday.
Lawrence’s representative, TMZ, said: “This is a clear violation of privacy.”
In a tweet, actor Seth Rogen criticized the hacker, saying: “Publishing photos from hacked phones is exactly the same as selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Sigma players have improved Lébra, even without winning
Olomouc - The thunder and lightning that the co-owner of the Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week seems to be a thing of the past.
Even though they brought only a point for a goalless draw from Opava in the end.
After all, the club boss got a little better with his deployment and combativeness.
The money for the paychecks could come to the club soon.
"I keep one more game, as I said last week, but I'm much more optimistic," Lebr said, adding that despite Sigma's failure to win, the players convinced him with an improved performance.
The combativeness and commitment that we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In that case, I can forgive him for not winning.
If we played like that from the beginning of the season, I am convinced that we have not lost yet,” says Lébr.
Sigma in Opava withstood the initial pressure of the home team, then leveled the game and in the second half was better.
After the victory, Kalvod's confidants reached, but they did not reach the goal, so they could not win.
The result is not according to our expectations.
To our full satisfaction, we lacked only one changed chance," said Lébr, who does not think that the change in the attitude of the players was caused only by his threats.
There were certainly more aspects.
Whether from my side, from the side of the coach, or from the side of the fans,” said Lébr.
Sigma has to count on pressure.
The players did not want to comment much after the match in Opava last week.
I'm trying to put these things away completely.
I tried not to admit it," young goalkeeper Michal Reichl shook his head.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not change Sigma’s biggest opportunity in Saturday’s match, left a question to Lébro’s statement last week.
But then he talked a little bit about the pressure.
We'll be under pressure all the time.
Everybody wants to pull on us.
"Today we have shown that if we fight and drive everybody on the ass, it will be possible," he said.
They took the warning to heart.
Even coach Leo<0xC5><0xA1> Kalvoda did not hide that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that prevailed in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized that, and today it was clear that they took Mr. Leber's warning to heart.
Even before, it wasn’t about not wanting to fight and flaunting it,” the Olomouc coach said.
It was like the first 15 minutes today.
It took us a while to come to terms with the toughness and realize what the second league was all about.
“It’s not just about football, it’s about fighting,” Kalvoda said.
We can only hope that in the next games Sigma will work from the beginning.
"I'd really like to believe that," he added.
