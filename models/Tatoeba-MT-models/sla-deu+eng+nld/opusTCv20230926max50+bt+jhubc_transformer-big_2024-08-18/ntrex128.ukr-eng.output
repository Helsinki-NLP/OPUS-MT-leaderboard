Members of the Assembly of Wales are concerned that they will be “associated with the muppets”
Some people are horrified by the recommendation to change the name of their post to "MWP".
This recommendation came about because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the “Parliament of Wales”.
WHEN the whole political spectrum is concerned that this may provoke ridicule.
One PM from Labour said that his group was worried about rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means "unthinkable" and pwp means the act of defecation.
CHA from the Party of Wales said that his group as a whole is “not satisfied” and offers alternatives.
One Welsh conservative said his group was “unbiased” about the name change, but drew attention to the fact that the MWP could quickly become a “muppet”.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the Assembly members will certainly be made by the members themselves.”
The Wales Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Wales Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the assembly into the Welsh Parliament received widespread support.
As for what to call CHA, the commission proposes to call them “Members of the Welsh Parliament”, i.e. WMP, but the MWP option has received the greatest public support.
Of course, WA offers alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could cause problems for Chairman Elin Jones, who is due to submit a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for suspending CH and the structure of the committee system.
CHA will hold a final vote on its new name when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians go to vote on a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes holding a referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of Saint-Martin are silent, because the churches of Harlem are going through difficult times
“Old people I’ve spoken to say that there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“These days, people are socializing differently.
Bars are no longer the kind of local living room they regularly go to.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the leaders hope, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced with condominium houses, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these homes will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches will close, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin was built ten years after it.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The Black community, which held rituals nearby, received ownership of the building.
Saint Martin moved to the black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street. These merchants did not want to hire blacks and promote them on the job.
In 1939, a fire badly damaged the building, but the parishioners of Father Johnson wanted to restore it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical tool”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, he was not found a replacement in Saint-Martin.
What has been happening in Saint Martin over the past few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been drawn by church leaders, others by the episcopal diocese.
The council — the governing body of the parish, which consists of lay leaders — wrote to the diocese in July that it was concerned that the diocese “would try to pass on the costs” to the council, despite the fact that the council did not take part in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
The shark injured a 13-year-old boy who dived for lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dived for lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at almost 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had dived with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and the group swam to get him out of the water.
At first Hammel thought it was just a delight about the caught lobster, but then realized that the boy was screaming: “I was bitten!
I was tasted!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his collarbone was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘In the water of the shark!’” added Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a press briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it did not belong to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper part of the body.
For the purposes of investigation and security, authorities shut down access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those that are in the department stores. Working on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased entry to the British cosmetics market worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods is declining) increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores across the country. Next year, if the idea turns out to be successful, the islands will appear in other stores.
Investments in cosmetics are due to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space: there will be branded zones similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the range of Boutique cosmetics: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop retailer is testing its trays at two Sainsbury’s stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, north London, last week, and the second one will open in Sellie Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make extra efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury’s, said their stores would become more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to counter discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, as well as a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this has increased food sales as well as made both networks more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to update its cosmetics and pharmaceuticals departments failed.
Sainsbury's was testing a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split pharmacies' revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds will help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury, said: “We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands we present is designed to meet any needs, and the pleasant atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is in competition with the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is “disappointed” by Holly Willoughby’s <0xC2><0xA3>11 million withdrawal from the deal
Dragon Lizard star Peter Jones is “disillusioned” by the fact that TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from the deal with his brand of goods for life (the cost of the deal is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for Truly’s home apparel and accessories brand.
The couple's business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the program This Morning announced her entry into Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought Peter Jones’ Dragon Lizard to a standstill when at the last minute she stepped out of their lucrative commodity business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was “disillusioned” when a golden TV girl confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at Jones’s business empire headquarters in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire that her new <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million deals mean she no longer has enough time to devote to his homework to their brandy.
This business was associated with the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and had to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew from the UK to one of her holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was without a doubt Holly's top priority.
It was to be its long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to leave the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
Headquartered in Marlow, there's a full warehouse of ready-to-sell items.
Experts believe that the departure of host This Morning, which is one of the highest paid stars in the UK, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothes and home clothes) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin were close to Jones and his wife Tara Kapp for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp created Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares of the company Baldwin, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will be M&S ambassador and will replace Anthony MacPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
A tough conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” as well as for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump do such great things?
said Trump, imitating the voice of a news anchor. —
I didn’t do anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
But negotiations on denuclearization have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “appropriate response” from the US to its first steps on disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have good relations with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a great relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remains of U.S. servicemen home.
He also defended his unusual approach when he spoke about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-filled stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok was affected, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is somewhat difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the fact that earthquakes are constantly occurring in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, tsunami shelters are built, but they are not typical for other coasts.
The apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid, likely contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not easy even in the best of times.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
The medical ship, which was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake, is sailing to Palu, but will be able to reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's infrastructure the cornerstone of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the funding shortfall has created problems for Mr. Joko’s administration, which plans to re-elect next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by prolonged interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as a result of clashes between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depths of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal. At this point his team lost 1-0.
He shifted the ball to his left leg and charged it in the direction of the far bar.
The ball flew high above the penalty area in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the jumping Kepa Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position so as not to waste time. Players like Shachiri always go on the attack as much as possible, so I just tried to save myself as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante approaching, and I made one touch, I didn't think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blue handed the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, swung around the middle of the field and quickly ran halfway to Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played in the wall in the middle of the field.
Then he made a good penetrating pass, which brought Azar to the penalty.
Hazard overtook the defense and made a decisive blow with his left foot into the net of the long bar. The ball passed past Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 15:00 on Wednesday at the San Paulo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Death toll from tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster relief agency said on Sunday.
Many people have been trapped in the wreckage of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-magnitude quake, which caused waves 6 meters high, the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was littered with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man on Suspected Murder After Woman Stabbed to Death
The investigation into the murder began after the woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stabbing wounds in Grayson-Muses, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called for people to respond who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I ask anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have filmed something on the recorder, to contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are now informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson-Mouse, had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and exit the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost his ability to speak.
Now the residents are told that it will be hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime there was a woman in tears.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were behind the fence, and another van was in front of the fence.
Several police officers stood behind the fence and watched over the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously call Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and call code 247 and the date of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near the Parliament becomes a new monument, which will suffer from the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved payment for the destruction in the Taliban-style of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statue near Westminster Palace would become a target.”
Iconoclastic warfare during the English Civil Wars was not carried out either by Cromwell himself or on his orders.
It is likely that Cromwell will be undeservedly sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The majestic statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Torneycroft is evidence of the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worth honoring.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many probably more in the late 19th century than now, Cromwell considers the defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of historical debates that continue.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the middle of the 17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth noting and honoring.”
Killer Pig Destroys Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by his surname Yuan was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig farm in a market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is going to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
He reportedly left with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pig farm was open.
The brother noted that in the pig farm there was a large boar with blood on his mouth.
Forensic examination confirmed that the 249-kilogram boar crushed the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s legs were in blood and distorted,” said the victim’s cousin with the surname Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager told Evening News that when police were gathering evidence at the scene, the pig was locked in to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that seven Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of attacks by pigs on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and inflicted critical injuries on the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg kept a Welsh farmer pressed against a tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger”.
“They’re just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rose will bring extensive rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rains with floods to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
The rose had winds of 137 km/h (category 1 hurricane) as of 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form a cavity, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday, Rosa will approach the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push strong tropical humidity north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rose will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in parts of Mexico.
Further in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching hollow, will create strong rains in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, garbage flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Strong tropical humidity will cause rainfall to rise to 5–7.6 cm per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large areas of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make canyons turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring turbulent winds and dust storms.
The approach of the trench will cause heavy rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of precipitation can exceed 1.27 cm, which can cause light rubbish flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and Monday morning, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rain will be more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the "For Corners" from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you will be able to observe a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
New York's temperatures could reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, about 12 degrees Celsius above average temperatures.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the Brett Kavanaugh case
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks watched fascinating testimonies from Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blazey Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Political confrontation continued, channels interrupted scheduled programs to report on Friday's latest news: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Cavanaugh had teased her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his emotional testimonies that he was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched it on Friday, according to research firm Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get figures on other networks that also showed hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring the number of people watching TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience watching a playoff game or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose thought show hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the leader among all the channels during the day-long hearing, with an average audience of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central figure in Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters were yelling at Flake as he tried to ride an elevator to a hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was barking, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, “You have power, and many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office published the statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for full Senate vote.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which is demanded by a democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons, and then with several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice had an impact, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of “playing politics” around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview alongside Teresa’s front page interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Brexit Checkers plan, saying it was “absolutely absurd” to offer Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other.
Who shot Wade Sims: police arrested Dayton Simpson on suspicion of the death of a player at the University of Louisiana
Police arrested the suspect in the shooting, which led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released a video of the dispute between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliated CBS channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found on them Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to shooting Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a pledge of $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police fugitives search unit, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police and local citizens for their assistance in the investigation that contributed to the arrest.
Louisiana State University sports director Joe Alleva thanked local law enforcement for “pregnancy and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, Louisiana State University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes on Mexico City
The ashes ejected by the volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern regions of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Natural Disaster Prevention on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as the crater began to be active and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center tracked numerous noises and shocks.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Chochimilko.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located at a distance of 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the vote for independence
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined the protesters' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
A masked pro-separatist group, held back by special forces, threw them eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place later in the day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of supporters of independence who chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive!", faced supporters of the preservation of the country, shouting: "Long live Spain!".
According to the local press, fourteen people were given help with light injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but marked by Catalan separatists, tensions remain high in the region seeking independence.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but the turnout was low, because the majority of those who opposed the secession boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but had to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents weep for the joy of being able to vote, but now we are at a standstill,” he said.
Despite a vital but very difficult victory in last December’s regional elections, the Catalan independence parties failed to keep the momentum this year, as many of their most prominent leaders are in voluntary exile or imprisonment awaiting trial for their participation in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is increasing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in detention since late last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The candidate’s status in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we see from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests men after car drives into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car drove into a house in Londonderry several times.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point on the car shot from the crossbow.
Mengy's strike secured Livingstone a 1-0 victory over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal as part of "Livingstone" became a winner
Raised in the class, Livingston stunned the Rangers and brought Steven Gerrard a second defeat out of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike was decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level with Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team has not won a single Premier League win this season and will play Harts leaders next Sunday, behind whom they are eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone continues their invincible move to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingston" misses the chances that unintelligible guests give.
Holt's team had to be ahead long before they scored, because their directness creates all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a blow along the gate, then Alan Litgow broke past the gate after being pushed and accepted Craig Halkett's blow along the gate, which he made with his head.
The owners were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems to guests from standard positions.
That was the decisive goal.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson engaged Menga, who took the ball and scored from the center of the penalty area.
Before this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the protection of the owners of the field was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unaffected.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick kicked Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Litgow hit past the gate in another standard combination of "Livingston".
The canopies were constantly flown into the Livingston penalty area and were constantly neutralized, and two applications for a penalty shootout — after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and for playing by hand — were rejected.
The phenomenon of "Livingstone": analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony McCaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and the result of "Livingstone".
All to one played well, they continued to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their playing style and line-up remained virtually unchanged after returning to the top level, but Holt should be credited for the way he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played grandiosely, very well organized the defense, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly on guard.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
Previously, they played very well under Gerrard, but now they do not significantly reach those standards.
They lacked the last ball — only once did they break through the defenses of the field owners — and it was a sort of wake-up call for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and blue skies were visible.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There has been some controversy between them on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still appeared nearby to see him.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters — many of them Kurds — have also made themselves heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests indicate the ambiguity of the guest, who some German Turks called a hero, and others - a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the area of Deptford in the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver of the car stopped, and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident came months after another cyclist died after the driver fled the scene on Childers Street, about 1.6 km from Saturday's crash.
London police said they were working to identify the man in order to inform his immediate relatives.
Driving is prohibited and bus routes are changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Injured in Riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of riots in a men's high-security prison, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire began at about 9:30 a.m. British standard time on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and localized in one wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
The officers were provided with medical care in connection with light facial injuries received at the scene.
A prison official commented: “A specially trained prison staff has been recruited to handle the incident, which continues in Her Majesty’s Long-Lartin prison.
Six employees received medical care due to injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be referred to the police and that the term of their detention may be extended.”
Her Majesty's Long Lartin prison has more than 500 inmates, including the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent to inpatient treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was called to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiard layers.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but it could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa travel through the southwestern desert, creating a risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings Monday and Tuesday in areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will rain in the evening on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is expected from 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and in places up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive between 2.54 and 5.08 cm of precipitation, in some places possibly up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of rainfall, the Rose rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these rains are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning still in hurricane strength with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, it is expected that with the force of a tropical storm during the day or in the evening of Monday, the hurricane will cause a landslide in Mexico.
Rainfall in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to range from 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm in some places,” according to weather.com.
Next, Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, will reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will go further through Arizona and later in the evening will reach South Utah on Tuesday.
“The main danger that is expected from Rose or her remains is very strong rains in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern American desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy with knife wounds was found in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northon at around 04:00 British Standard Time on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asking everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone to respond.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Ugliness and Anger' of Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Willinghu, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “tolerated the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Cavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vehemently and emotionally denying Christine Blazey Ford’s accusations that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at a hearing on the charges she had brought.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president casually mentioned Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks there will be some of the most important choices in our lives.
“I don’t run, but I do run,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump said the Democrats’ mission was to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an aide to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people were killed and many washed up in the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at the beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the twilight crashed against the shore, knocking many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately start running, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it moved cars, trees, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned upside down and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
Shootings in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday’s powerful earthquake was 200 times more than the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, could contribute to the strength of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "widespread" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 mi) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
“The lines of communication have been completely damaged and we have not received any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had left for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami hit Pal, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
In amateur footage that people shared on social networks, you can see how a man on the upper floor of the house shouts crazy warnings about the approach of a tsunami to people on the street under the building.
A few minutes later, a wall of water crashed into the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated people still need food and other essentials.
The city’s airport has only been opened for aid and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision workers from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the yard of their office, but on the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups began to take decisive action to address the aftermath of the disaster, some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to travel to Palu.
Under Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if a disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“This is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national catastrophe,” we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.
The second night fell on Palu after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and friends and families of those who have not yet found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers picked up a woman who had been lying under the rocks for two days, along with her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's paragliding national team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games, which took place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have an emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon relates how hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paraglider community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu’s rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey checkmark, rather than double blue checkmarks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves took $26,750 during the replenishment of the ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who ran an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, wrote detective Dennis McCarthy in the news.
While he was busy, the other man "ran back to the employee Brink" and stole a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses spotted several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the news, but the police did not indicate the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Formerly officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West was called Ye for a while, and he used this abbreviation as a title for his album, released in June.
The change came ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to unveil his new album Yandhi.
On the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons", the show's author said.
This is not just a shortening of the current professional name, West had previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe that 'is' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So it's you, it's us, it's us.
Kanye, which means “one,” was shortened to simply JE — it’s just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with hyphenation and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vows not to use military force against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to be established throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to entrants and opening more free public universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double its funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China ramps up its AI activity, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on AI research, according to AI investor Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become the No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“A double budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the likelihood that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “KI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous KI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the best American player at Othello, and later served as executive director of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee noted previous technology competitions held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when the next ones would be to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China taking academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the US increase its efforts in the field of AI.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to candidates of science in the field of AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Endowment for Natural Sciences provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations are distributing money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work in China lower, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to establish a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country’s name
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will allow to resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's possibility of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments struck a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the deal argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gheorghe Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum, and because of the boycott campaign, there are doubts whether the turnout of voters will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow to consider the referendum valid.
The question in the referendum ballot reads: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU subject to an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining such bodies as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
While the result of the vote carries no legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
To change the name, two-thirds of the votes in parliament will be required.
The state election commission said that until 13:00 there were no reports of violations.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the ballot box.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” 62-year-old Gjoze Tanevski, who is in the capital Skopje, said in a statement.
September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko gave their vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country, which will open the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and set up chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with our head held proudly, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, like China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring a lot of necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, since more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes” would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, between 30 and 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since the beginning of its work in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes the entire defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling passed the defense of Brighton and brought Manchester City a 2–0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Agüero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentinian striker got a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three defenders of Brighton and found himself in the open field.
Then Agüero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He circumvented one defender, then circumvented several more on the edge of the penalty "Brighton".
Then he made a pass to the left, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch at the penalty box to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot launched it into the right side of the gate, defeating goalkeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some leg problems,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this point.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this match of the Premier League provided Sterling.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank of Lera Sane.
Leroy made a few touches and then made a pass to Sterling in the direction of the far rod.
Forward of the sky-blue threw the ball into the gate just before slipping outside.
City will meet Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to take away the glasses in "Rokis"
Since the team of the Washington Nationals came out of the playoffs, there was no good reason to wait for another start.
But the rival Scherzer hopes to get on the pitcher's slide on Sunday in a match against the Colorado Rockies, provided that the Rockies will still have difficulty reaching the playoffs. Now, the Rockies are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League of the West.
The Rockies have at least a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure the first division title.
“Although we play for nothing, at least we can leave the ball knowing how the audience behaves here in Denver, and the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve seen all year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are leaning towards the fact that it will be Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, on Thursday had a pitching session and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
The Washington Right scores 18-7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president hurriedly recalled the situation around his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters’ turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
In five weeks there will be some of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones — I don’t run, but I do run, so wherever I can, I fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrific, horrific radical group of Democrats, you see this happening now.
And they are firmly set to regain power, using any means, you see the filth, the scoundrel.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who they need to step over in order to gain power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats, in his words, "to resist and obstruct."
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil and mean, disgusting and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked the audience to loud outcry of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you provide a document?
Uh, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting — it was really bad body language — worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinion.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to convict me, it almost came as no surprise.
In the end, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not welcome, and all because we are expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated almost the same way because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a report on the meeting, Labour’s Nottingham East said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the General Committee's evening Friday meetings in my eight years as a local Member of Parliament from Labour have been exactly that.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of a “more friendly, softer” policy has long been forgotten, if it was ever started at all.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that no different views are allowed in the Labour Party, and every opinion is assessed from the standpoint of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had similar political views began to expect that I would turn 180 degrees and adopt positions that I would never agree with, be it national security or the EU single market.
Every time I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — it’s followed by a tirade of attacks on social media with calls for revocation, condemnation of the center’s policies, I’m told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it’s not just my experience.
I know I’ve been more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I’ve received are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should nurture a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with each movement of “distrust” or changing the rules of selection the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I have been urged not to stand up, not to speak out so loud that “all is well with me”.
That’s not why I came to politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because my middle school class was literally falling apart because of a lack of attention from the Thatcher government, and since then I've been trying to improve the quality of public services for those most in need, whether it's a local councilor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was confused by my political views and disagreements with the current leadership.
For those who contributed to Friday’s events, I want to say only one thing: in a context where the country is moving towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, I have another message, not for the Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, and not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat to recall me and no political gain will prevent me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Air 38 - 17 Melrose: The undefeated Air rises
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but no doubt Air deserved a triumph in today's great entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
Now they are leading the table, this is the only undefeated team out of ten.
After all, a great defense and improved ability to take chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Murcia the full right to be satisfied.
“So far we have been tested by our games and we are still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented, “I pay tribute to Air, they took better chances than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Climo, brought Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Verriors, allowed Melrose to show the numbers, and Jason Baggott used an unrealized attempt.
Klimot strengthened the leadership of Air with a penalty shootout and just before the break made and implemented a solo attempt, which gave the score 17-5 in favor of Air.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a prolonged delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was carried off the field on a stretcher, and from the restart "Air" broke forward with the help of the attempt of Stafford McDowell, which was implemented by Klimo.
Air captain Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another player to pay an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, but when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind Air Pier.
Klimot made an attempt, which he did almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch in the box from David Armstrong and sent the flanker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the host team.
It looks like the star of the series "Still a game" is set for a new career in the restaurant sector
It seems that the star of the series "Still a game" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the hospitality sector. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at the Scottish Sun hinted that Kirnan wanted to enter Glasgow’s “prosperous restaurant business.”
“Our Sea”: Inland Bolivia hopes that the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors patrol the equipped headquarters of the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings display an ocean-blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “Our sea is right.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of the coastline, which left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on Oct. 1 after five years of trial.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calsad<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the ICJ decision on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia that, after decades of snippet of talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate a sovereign access to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also has high hopes for a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, little will change.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to award Chilean territory and noted that it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ’s decision, made only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia was not advanced, the last four years could contribute to the rollback.
“The issue of access to the sea has been used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagreed that the court’s decision was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of disagreements by benefiting from each other,” he said.
Kalsadiya also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political snare.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This resolution is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If It Can't Trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy that has stalled more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the belief that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will one day bring North Korea to its knees is an “unrealistic dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive hats, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you have found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a series of eccentric oversize hats from the spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalks of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have already sent their dizzying creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out as an extravagant beige hat with wide feathered fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with precious stones watermelons, a magician's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very timely before Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creature resembled a snorkeling equipment with a tube and glasses, the other looked like an ice cream scoop that melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you are lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go to the main streets of your city.
Oversize hats came into fashion thanks to "La Bombi", a straw hat with fields sixty centimeters wide, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere on social media gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag almost the size of a model in a swimsuit that carried it.
The yellowish-red raffia bag with raffia fringe and white leather handle was a central element of the La Riviera spring-summer 2019 collection of the Jacquesmus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edward: knowledge of languages is a must for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 they again received excellent exam results, complemented by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
These schools, which enroll more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SICs). They strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career, as well as make them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individualized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language they understand, they perceive it with their mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she perceives it with her heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best grades.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A score.
The data collected at 74 schools in the country showed that 72% of students received a higher A score in Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Now languages as a subject of choice are taught in the same way as the subjects of NTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), in the framework of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Skills Commission found that 17% of the reasons why employers can’t close vacancies are related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more promising positions require language proficiency, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-time job.
In Scotland, each school will learn their own languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK from the 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, it will always be possible to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary to succeed no matter what the future holds for them.
Now it cannot be denied that in the international business environment languages continue to be vital for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers, almost awaited.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in his first pre-season match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play has not yet been decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers pre-season games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rallies in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election rallies today from Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies planned for next week, including rallies in friendly states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote on the candidacy he proposed to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump is seeking to form support for the upcoming midterm election as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after a November vote.
What time is Trump’s evening rally in West Virginia and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the tense hearings this week over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s postponement of voting for a week as the FBI’s investigation continues.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November elections.
Representatives of President Trump said the five rallies next week are aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as the campaign season is approaching,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
Fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, may attend today’s rally at the Wesbanko Arena in Wheeling, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday's visit will be Trump's second in the past month to West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40% of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate to the Senate of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, whose rating lags behind the results of the polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissey that the president is coming to raise his rating in polls,” Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team is set to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, Saturday afternoon forsoms can become exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
Pulse Pendulum is a completely fictitious sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when will they say that the impulse works?
“They were six points ahead and now four, so I think we’re taking it a little bit as a boost,” said Jordan Spitt as he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, four points ahead and another twelve in the game.
Americans, Spitt says, feel a little wind in their sails, also a lot of them encouraging, not least the form of Spitt and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Sleeping with his killer punches from the ti-field to the green shows an example.
These laryngeal cries of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive putt and leveled the score in the fourth match after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patt, which allowed them to win the match on the 15 hole, was met with a similar cry, one that tells you that the American team does not give up.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own match,” Spitt said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who did not make boggies on Saturday afternoons, they also managed to avoid boggies on Saturday mornings and Friday afternoons and on Friday mornings at the nine last holes.
This run, and how their energy seems to flow to this tumultuous crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to secure a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of the Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning trophy when he was paired with Alex Noren.
One boggi and two dobles on the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It’s very interesting to watch forballs and forsomes closely because of the interaction between the couple’s participants, because of the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and it’s also interesting to watch how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe still plays better as a team and has a significant advantage on the last day, but this session of forces also showed that the US team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forballs and forces, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired by the duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, they have won two victories over the lagging Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
Thomas Björn's European team, which is trying to regain the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning trophy draw with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in force and won two matches, but failed to narrow the gap.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Mollinari (together Mollywood) are just the second pair to score four points in the first four games of the Ryder Cup.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the trophy, they teamed up to defeat the swollen Woods and novice American Bryson Deshambeau with even more spectacular 5t4s.
Woods, who drew two matches on Saturday, showed occasional flashes of genius, but so far he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in the forbolls and forbolls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forballs, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the forsoms to get a 2t1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are first and third in the world rankings.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way this pleasant fresh day southwest of Paris.
Three times, the main winner Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans with their two points.
They won a decisive 2ta1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forbours and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with 4ta3 in the forbours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team return with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furik's team only needed a draw to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if she is not able to do it.
North Korea says it will not “under any circumstances” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens distrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement proved important because it did not reject the unilateral denuclearization that Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump promised security guarantees to North Korea.
North Korea seeks a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposes the ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“To believe that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If South Korea were on the side of denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone to such a dead end.”
Despite this, Ri’s tone was sharply different from last year’s when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting the US mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” who wants to commit suicide.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot to be done and sanctions should remain in place until the denuclearization of North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a timeline for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and relentlessly until we see complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for “gangster demands.”
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes “appropriate measures”.
He said that, according to Kim, he needed “appropriate measures” are the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all of its students with more sleep. It is an attempt to combat the growing culture of steepness of learning all night after being refilled with caffeine.
The teacher found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of yourself.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, a girl approached him and said, “Why am I being told this now, in my final year?”
“She told me that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
In the course, which was first introduced this year, students are explained the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said the university decided to introduce the course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep for a week.
The hour-long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, simulators and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of sleep-related routines.
Another section tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, the campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the health effects of smoking,” Chaisler added.
A culture of pride for “wake up all night” still exists, he added, noting that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with weight gain, as sleep deprivation turns the brain into a hunger regime that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all postgraduate students with a request to undergo a similar program of study before coming to a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler advises students to put reminders to go to bed, as well as to put an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": goal Menga upset the guys Gerrard
The Rangers survived another attack of outgoing sadness: Dolly Menga's strike brought a disparate team of Stephen Gerrard a 1-0 defeat to Livingston.
Ibrox's team sought their first win in a away game after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4–1, but Gary Holt's team inflicted Gerrard a second loss as manager of 18 games. Gerrard's team remained eight points behind the leaders of the Scottish Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers squad, which lacked inspiration, did not look like it could even the score.
Now "Rangers have fallen to the sixth position, and "Livingston" have risen to the third, and in the difference of balls they are ahead only "Hibernian".
In addition, "Rangers" may face another problem, because the liner Calum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown from the guest sector in some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once passed Air to the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same Levi 11 squad that took one point at Harts last week, and was thrilled to see his extortioned guys crushing rivals at every turn.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingstons worked more with the ball.
They were supposed to score after just two minutes of play when Menga's first pass into the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this big chance by sending the ball past the goal.
Deep free kick Keagan Jacobs got skipper Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the rear bar
The Rangers did gain control, but in the final third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should be eligible for a penalty shootout at the mark of a quarter of an hour after the collision with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the appeal of the Colombian.
The Rangers managed to make only two shots against the goal in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassana Kulibali with the head and the calm blow of Ovie Edgeria almost did not bother.
And although Livingstone’s 34-minute goal may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only with their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs's harvest.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who calmly chose Menga for a simple finish.
In the break Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and this change almost immediately worked when the winger broke through to Morelos, but the striking Kelly ran from his line to block him.
However, Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Litgow and Halkett made one long pass after another.
Holt's team could have improved in the final stages, but McGregor did well against Jacobs before Litgow hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he encountered Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanac: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and the time is coming... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the countable Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film The Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious-looking cowboy scientists.
Man: “What is it?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how the radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: "Well, well, it's really cracking right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" the protein that is common to many types of cancer. Then these cells are again injected into the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” the protein common to many cancers (HER2), and then re-injecting these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of several types of cancer’, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer,” he explained.
A similar approach, which consists in removing immune cells in patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in a baseball cap MAGA Kanye West blunted with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the audience
Viewers at the SNL (Saturday Evening Live) show studio whistled Kanye after his puzzling speech, during which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would run for the presidency in 2020.
After performing a third song titled Ghost Town in a baseball cap with the inscription “Let’s give America back its former glory,” he exploded in a tirade in which he criticized the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often during the conversation, white people ask me, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist.’
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the case of Christine Blaise Ford's sexual assault suit.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, a video with his tirade was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock wanted to ridicule Vesta by posting this post.
Also, West complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him happened an unpleasant situation because of the headdress.
According to the Washington Examiner, West said: “When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball cap."
They mocked me!
And then they tell me that I am in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
West continued, "Do you want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'm going to wear my Superman baseball cap because no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of the audience in the hall, and the actors of the show SNL looked confused. One of the audience said: "The studio was dead silence."
Vesta was invited at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the broadcast.
West caused many surprises by performing the song I Love it in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Vesta supported the head of the conservative organization TPUSA, Candes Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR WHICH HAPPENED AGAINST NATO."
Talk show host Karen Gunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and that's just great."
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, professes and throws out an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he is "the one who used to be known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name; he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Paffy, and P. Diddy.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg used to be called Snoop Lyon, and it is known that the musical legend of recent decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became "The Artist Formerly Known as Prince".

The prosecutor will consider the accusation.
Game of Thrones star Keith Herington condemns the idealization of brutality
Cat Gerington became famous for his role as the swordsman John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones, produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out condemning the macho hero stereotype, arguing that because of such heroes on screens, young guys often think that they have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he thought "something went wrong" and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of #MeTo hashtag popularity (#yatakoj, #trouble, etc.).
Keith, who recently married his co-star on Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was “quite determined” to tackle the problem.
"I am quite determined at the moment. When did we start on a slippery path of idealization of brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the lens of the problem we see now?"
Keith believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through depictions of extremely brave characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is planted for us?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressured to be just such men?
In my opinion, today the really important question is “How can we change this?”
It’s clear that the young people have gone the wrong way.”
In an interview, he also noted that he would not star in any of the prequels and sequels of Game of Thrones after the show ended next summer, as "he's already done with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play in the production of the play "The Real West" by Sam Shepard - the story of the film producer and his brother-thefter.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers the meeting with his wife Rose the best he got from participating in the series "Game of Thrones".
“During the filming of this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life,” Keith said.
In the fantasy series, which received the Emmy Awards, Rose played Igritt – the love of the hero of Herington John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony was held on the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China says 14% increase in new cases
In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
According to the representatives of health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018, 40,000 new cases were reported.
In most cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, indicating a change in the past trend.
For a long time, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions in some regions of China.
However, health officials said during a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV has fallen to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV over time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT community is often discriminated against.
According to research, 70-90% of men who have sexual relations with other men later marry women because of the dominance of conservative values in the country.
Transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to provide free access to HIV medicines, seeing this as a way to partially solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the networking of Republican senators by her full-time employee and sharply criticizes "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denounced allegations that one of her full-time employees had posted the personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argues that these statements propagate “ultra-right” political commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies, and then even more disgusting lies," Waters said on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during a hearing in the Senate Commission on accusations of unlawful acts of a sexual nature, put forward against Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the position of judge of the US Supreme Court.
The leak came shortly after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper reported that conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the leak source was linked to Waters' office and was able to track down the data of her full-time employee.
“These unfounded claims are absolutely false, they are not true,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office, whose personal data and security has been compromised as a result of these fabricated and deceptive statements, has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unfounded claims are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that, with such a character, she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not behave insolently.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmoved.”
Fleischer seemed to draw parallels between Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take Waters' place as a result of the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In a statement, Waters said her office had already notified “the relevant state and law enforcement agencies of these false statements.”
“We will do everything we can to find the perpetrators,” she continued, “and they have responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" – a passing parody of spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has already become a good tradition to look for meanings in every new British film inspired by Brexit. There are them in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on the action films about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released in 2003, later the series resumed in 2011, filming "Johnny English: Rerun".
Will a mockingly ironic self-satire on how stupid we are become the nation’s new export potential?
Either way, Johnny English with his moving face and bulging eyes got a second chance to make a mess, with his name more than anything else indicating that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is a relentlessly cheerful secret agent, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean and a lot of things - from the guy who played one note of the melody from the movie "Chariots of Fire" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
The character is also a traveler and an international mystery that has always left behind the mess that Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten television commercial of Barclaycard.
In the latest film about Johnny English, there are several good moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English, wearing knightly armor, approached the helicopter, and the blades of the screw were beating on his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for making a bufonade is well revealed, but humor is fleeting, and in some moments it is too much, especially when compared to "serious" film brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible", one of the "ingredients" of which is also a comedy.
It seems to me that jokes are designed for children rather than adults, and the senseless misfortunes that happen to Johnny English do not seem to me as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson’s wits in the silent Bean films.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there is a serious threat over the UK.
In the British super-secret network of spies penetrates a hacker and reveals the names of all field agents, which was a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episode role in the film).
This turned out to be the last straw for the prime minister – an arrogant person who has already suffered devastating criticism and is deeply depressed due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image inspired by Theresa May, but the script did not allow to fully disclose it).
Intelligence advisers informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to recruit someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in some superfashionable institution and unofficially teaches children to operate undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teenagers there were several good jokes).
English is quickly taken to Whitehall for an urgent briefing, where he meets again with his long-suffering friend Buff, played once again by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of the exalted annoying person does not quite match the talent of Vicky Pepperdine).
So, when everything in Her Majesty's Secret Service went wrong, "Batman and Robin" are back in action and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in the field of technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network - the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and resort again to their ridiculous tricks: disguised by waiters they commit a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht Volta; English arranges a real mess when trying to take advantage of the shovel.
All stops bring us to the last episode, but with its good-naturedness and madness it is somewhat like a movie for children.
Passing film.
As with the other Johnny English movies, I asked myself the same question: can’t the British film industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
Labour rejects a plan that would allow the British to work four days a week, but get paid in five days.
Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is set to discuss a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week, but receive a salary in five days.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the heads of companies to transfer funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to employees, providing them with an additional weekend.
Thus, workers will have a three-day holiday and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to the sources, this idea will correspond to the economic program of the party and will direct the resources of the country to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved at the British Trade Union Congress. It is expected that in this way workers will be able to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
A Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
Labour was not the first to approve the idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day working week during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party currently approve of such aspiration.
A Labour spokesman said: “The party’s political agenda does not include a four-day working week, so we are not considering this idea now.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party’s election congress last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the “faceless directors” of utilities and “demanders”.
The shadow chancellor’s plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their full share of capital if the Labour government introduces a “deduction” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also reaffirmed his intention to include workers in the boards of companies and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the usual shares of private sector firms to workers who are expected to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy talk on the 60 Minutes show about whether the FBI’s Cavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who leads the FBI, the final vote for his appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether the Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh after the results of the investigation of the Bureau.
On Sunday’s 60 Minutes, Scott Pelli asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
During the hearing, I said that I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after everything happened and the accusation came out, asking him, “Did you really do this?”
He was resolute, unwavering, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that Kavanaugh’s indictment is a provocation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything," Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't prove it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t know what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it impact poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with a staggering number of star performers and a no less exciting mission – to overcome poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the true goal of the festival – the organizers strive to overcome extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must complete a number of tasks or “doings”, such as taking part in a volunteer project, writing an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else to help draw attention to the organization’s goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding a free concert for an act really a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel that they are really changing something by signing an e-petition or making a post on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “actions” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion, which will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 financial commitments and public statements as an example of its performance, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
According to the group, the funds provided have already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial commitments is the Foundation The Power of Nutrition, which is territorially related to the UK. As part of the project, investors and implementers undertook to "help children grow up" and promised to provide Rwanda with $ 35 million in aid to overcome the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citerti.
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said Tracy Ullman, a spokeswoman for The Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 “actions” called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the UK government announced the allocation of funds for the project The Power of Nutrition, aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can overcome extreme poverty?",
Global Citizen wrote: “This is a long and difficult road, so sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements to us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Gianella Mona are just a part of the star performers who will perform at this year’s festival in New York City, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The interior minister said that the United States could use naval forces to "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian energy resources
According to US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary” Washington can seek help from the Navy to prevent Russian energy resources from entering the markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it is acting at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a reason to explore new energy markets.
“I believe they are in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“Thanks to the U.S. Navy, it can provide free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke appealed to the participants of the event, which was held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He further compared the approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy resources efficiently and replace them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy carriers of mineral origin.
While these statements were heard, the Trump administration set a goal to increase the export of compressed natural gas to Europe, ousting from the market of energy carriers of Russian origin, a much cheaper option for Europeans.
To do this, Trump administration officials and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “unsuitable” project for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which costs 11 billion dollars and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington is ardently opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my view, we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
Germany’s leading industry organization, the Federal Association of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I don’t like it when a third country interferes in our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, said after German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s last meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will “seriously think” about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “seriously think” about running for president after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Goliath, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering running for office.
As reported by The Hill, Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and for this to be headed by a woman.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider my candidacy for president.”
During a public meeting, Warren expressed her appreciation for Donald Trump’s presidency, saying that he would “lead his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren tweeted: “...there is no doubt that the FBI must conduct an investigation before the vote.”
However, according to a poll released on Friday, a majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run in 2020.
According to a poll conducted jointly by the University of Suffolk’s Center for Political Research and The Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential Massachusetts voters opposed the senator’s nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The results of the poll showed that the former Governor Deval Patrick enjoys more support. For the potential nomination of him as President, 38%, against – 48%.
In discussions of other prominent Democrats who may run in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are also named.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence. The incident occurred on Monday night.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after his return, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are coming home with,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called Trek's arrest "a problem that no one pays attention to" and said her son and other war veterans "are returning home not as they used to be, more brutal, and want to know if they respect what their fellow soldiers, pilots and other servicemen have done for this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vassilla Police Department, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vassilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assaulting a woman, as well as interfering with reports of violence and carrying a gun in a state of alcoholic intoxication.
18 states and the District of Columbia support challenging asylum policies
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging the new U.S. policy, under which victims of banditry and domestic violence are denied refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county sent an analytical memo to a court consultant in Washington to support a plaintiff in need of asylum and challenged the policy in court.
The plaintiff's full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Rights Union, which challenges federal policy and was filed in August, has not been disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his brutal sons-bandits" beat her, but U.S. officials denied her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace's lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees of which often seek asylum in the United States) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new refugee status policy overturns a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Reisin said during his speech on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set forth in such a statement, and the ban violates this principle,” the court’s consultant said in an analytical note.
Further, in an analytical note, prosecutors argue that policies that ban immigrants from entering the U.S. hurt the country’s economy because they could potentially become entrepreneurs and “recharge the necessary labor resources.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June issued an order for immigration judges to no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership of certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperate to find survivors, while the death toll in Palu has doubled.
For those who are still alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” says the 35-year-old mother, calming her fever-stricken boy in the evacuation center of the ruined city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
There is no clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, take over the flooded possessions, trying to save what they found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the earthquake, whose strength was 7.5 on the Richter scale, were overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Geris with a fractured back and shoulder, rest near the Palu Army Hospital building, where patients are treated in the open air due to constant repeated shocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he recalled how a strong shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I was trapped in the wreckage of the wall,” Gerris told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Making Psychological Pressure” Through “Propaganda-Containing Ads”
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper posted on four pages of a U.S. daily newspaper advertising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid app for China Daily in Des Moines Register – Iowa’s most popular newspaper after accusing China of trying to influence the November 6th congressional elections. China rejects these accusations.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s statements accusing Beijing of trying to meddle in the U.S. election mean a new phase of Washington’s escalation aimed at putting pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place advertisements to boost trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington in time, in which they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of a repressive tariff in China was intended to strike exporters from such states as Iowa, which supported the Republican Party of trump.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in a column for Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “increases pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American people’s tradition of freedom of speech and independence of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Brensted wrote.
"In contrast, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only individual voices of dissenters. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which causes concern, from which it can be concluded that the Chinese media are under the reliable control of the Chinese Communist Party,"
He also added that "one of the respected Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not specify which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh Republicans are setting up against themselves women voters before the midterm elections
As many prominent Republicans back and defend Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh after he was charged with sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could trigger an unwanted reaction ahead of the upcoming midterm elections, especially for women.
There are passions around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things cannot then simply be played back,” Grant Rieger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview published on Saturday.
Rieger expressed doubt that the FBI investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) began to insist on at the last minute, would be enough to reassure angry voters.
As reported by Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesperson of the progressive group MoveOn, Catherine Jean-Perrier, said on Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget about it tomorrow or in November.”
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is approaching!" during a demonstration at the Legal Committee when Republicans decided to move to the approval of Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazey Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political columnist, said: “People will be extremely interested and motivated.”
“They say it’s happening now, and it’s true.
However, motivation can increase, especially for women voters aged 18-29 from suburbs who have not yet decided and often don’t vote if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford testified in connection with the accusations of the candidate for the post of judge of the Supreme court of sexual offences, analysts predicted the negative reaction of voters, if the Republicans insist on approval.
According to NBC News, earlier this week, former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele said, “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As Guy Cecil, the director of Priorities USA (a group that helps Democrats in the election campaign), noted in an interview with the news channel, “it’s not about the committee vote, the final vote, or the fact that Cavanaugh was in the jury, but how they reacted to the situation and how they reacted.”
However, the opinions of Americans about whose testimony to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, were divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimonies, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimonies.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that, in their opinion, Kavanaugh gave or most likely gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
As reported by The Guardian, after the insistence of Flake, the FBI conducts an examination of the indictments put forward by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee about how Kavanaugh assaulted her while intoxicated when she was 17.
Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez said a Supreme Court Justice candidate showed her her genitals at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the Internet, is launching a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, Inrupt, is developing an open-source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and who to give access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data repository" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current affairs lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user, who can access any information.
The company calls it an “expansion of personal capabilities through data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to leverage resources, processes and related skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all of their business models undergo radical changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “ensure commercial energy and ecosystems and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I am very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration on the occasion of the presentation to the representative of the Church of the Order of the Victoria Cross during the First World War
The only representative of the Church of England, who received the Order of the Victoria Cross for participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann received an award for his participation in the attack at Belle Angle and Leocourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later and never found out he had received Britain's highest military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann moved his battalion through the Canal Saint-Cathen "through very dense fog and under dense fire of field guns and machine guns".
Later he hastened to the firing line and with "desperate courage" led the detachment forward, before which one broke into the field cannon and destroyed three cannons of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Wanna was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did something he himself would never be able to repeat and that he deserves respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Vann laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "feels very proud to participate in this parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the respect that so many people show him."
MMA fans did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead they were shown "Peppa Pig"
Imagine not sleeping all night just to watch the eventful Bellator 206 tournament, and you are denied the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose tournament featured 13 fights, including six main program matches, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Geghard Moussasi and Rory Macdonald were preparing for a fight, television viewers in the UK were stunned when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some spectators were not thrilled by this, as they did not sleep until the morning, waiting for the fight.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "some kind of a bad joke".
“According to a government decree, the content broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to play a children’s show,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations when asked about the TV show.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator President Scott Cocker has promised to work on broadcast schedules to reach audiences in the UK in the future.
“I think if we talk about repeating the broadcast, we can arrange it,” Coker said.
“But now there is a Sunday, 6 am, and we can’t do anything until we have a Sunday and they have a Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages to which we responded, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical fault, and we tried to fix it.
However, it turned out that it was inconsistent with government regulations.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We will reduce the tournament to five fights instead of six as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we have postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "worse" than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic jumper Tom Daly says that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he did not understand that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
While participating in the broadcast of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he was frank about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that due to paternity, he became less concerned about winning the Olympic Games.
The presenter, who has been leading this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for several months.
Arriving as a couple on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "worse" than others as a child, because "the public did not accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and difference was exactly what gave me the strength and the strength to succeed."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a prominent champion of LGBT rights and used the appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views, because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that his feelings for his husband, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, was a real surprise for him.
Daly married an Oscar-winning actor 20 years older than him last year, but he said age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" (he played at the first Olympic Games at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have experienced similar ups and downs.
In June, the couple had a son, named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and since then, according to Daly, his "worldview" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think that I should get gold,” he said.
"You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said his father could not put up with the idea of the end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be sitting in the front row because you won’t be around anymore,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only after he actually stopped breathing and died that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly took part in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew that was what I had been dreaming of all my life: diving in front of my countrymen at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daly said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud (Proud) performed by Heather Small – which resonated with him during preparations for the Olympic Games and still causes ants.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday, from the match of the tournament for the "Cup Ryder" removed Michelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Michelson set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th game in the tournament for the Ryder Cup, but he has to restore shape so that this event does not become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who for the record 12th time took part in the tournament, which takes place every two years, removed from the game Captain Jim Furyk for the time of the forbols and forces.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did when playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the sidelines, hoping to master emotions.
Since Michelson was not famous for hitting well even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for the challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the rift usually punishes for straying punches.
And if the field itself is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet with the champion of the Open Championship and master of precision punch Francesco Molinari, who paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, the match of Michelson can be decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his athlete, and, probably, besides this, he had nothing to add.
“He fully understood his role today, slapped me on the back, hugged me and said that tomorrow he would be ready,” Furyk said.
“He has no doubts about his abilities.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I was predicting more matches, but that’s what happened, and so we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, on the field, just like anyone else.”
If Michelson gets on the field on Saturday, he will beat the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most games in the tournament "Ryder Cup".
On this, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never corresponded to his individual achievements.
Michelson scored 18 wins, 20 defeats and 7 draws, but Furyck said his presence could play a decisive role for the team.
“He’s funny, he’s funny, he’s funny, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s great to have on the team,” Furyk said.
“I think the younger players had a lot of fun coming up to him, as well as this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Björn knows that the big gap does not solve anything
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the tangible gap before the singles matches of the last day of the tournament for the Ryder Cup does not guarantee victory yet.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Walderram's field, where the team led by Seva Ballesteros beat the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight margin of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the game at Walderrams; a big gap in Brookline, where we lost, and at Walderrams, where we won hard,” Björn said after watching the winning Class 2018 games with a 5:3 result on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium.
So history teaches me and every player on the team that nothing has been solved yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the best of luck.
Go out on the field and do what you need to do.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said before, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who is opposing us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players in a difficult field, Björn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow things could be different.
Tomorrow we will have individual matches, and this is something else.
It’s cool to play on the field with a partner when everything is going well, but it’s when you’re standing there alone and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the verge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he must also show what he is capable of.”
Unlike Björn, Jim Furyk expects his partners to play the best game on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furyk himself, fate on the last day was returned by different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when the team from Europe created "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone else's side, players in the middle of the distance are subjected to special pressure.
We put the players on the team as if we were going to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the counteroffensive in the top match against Rory McIlroy. Next in the first half of the team of Europeans were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
“It is these partners that I have chosen in this order because I want to evenly distribute the efforts throughout the game,” Björn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The commissioning of a new German warship was postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be put into operation in 2014 instead of the outdated battleships of the Cold War. However, according to local media, this will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and rapid growth in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from the spokesman of the military department, the commissioning of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main vessel of the series of the most modern frigates of the class "Baden-Württemberg", postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is the longer maintenance period. It is expected that the new frigates will be able not to return to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists of Die Zeit warn that due to the constant delays, ultra-modern warships, which were supposed to strengthen Germany's military power at sea, will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The long-suffering frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time a military ship has returned to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "defects of software and equipment" that made the battleship unfit for military operations.
The disadvantages of the software are particularly important, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ship consists of about 120 sailors - this is only half the number of soldiers who served on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the ship has a significant excess weight, which worsens its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the frigate "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates gained special weight in the light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, the Bundestag Armed Services Commissioner Hans-Peter Bartels reported that the country’s navy “was left with few ships suitable for combat missions.”
The official said that the situation deteriorated rapidly over a period of time, as old ships were decommissioned and new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret over the fact that none of the frigates of the class "Baden-Württemberg" was not able to replenish the Navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
The new study, which is being carried out on the grounds of land ownership in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
The scientists hope that the data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out measures for their preservation in the future.
In the gardens of Inverry in Wester Ross, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe species such as bat dwarf and bat pygmy, as well as the common olfactory and watery nightshade.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the territory of land ownership to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to determine the frequency and affiliation of the screams of bats.
Then it is planned to develop a detailed map of the animals’ habitat and prepare a report to link the animals’ behavior to their habitat.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes the findings will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (e.g. meadow formation) and identify optimal methods of forest conservation for bats and other related species.
During the last century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by active construction and development of territories, which deprives them of nesting places.
Other negative factors include wind installations and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears are more effective at catching prey than the eyes.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to detect insects and obstructions on the flight trajectory.
The National Trust of Scotland, which handles more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special importance and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization even created the first and only in Scotland reserve for bats. It is located on the territory of the Tryve estate in the region of Dumfries and Galloway. It found shelter eight out of ten species of bats living in Scotland.
The estate manager David Thompson claims that this is the perfect place for them.
"In the territory of the Tryv estate excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we do here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before carrying out any technical work, since due to the unintentional destruction of one nesting place for breeding young can kill up to 400 females with young, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or disturb.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Fledermaus Conservation Centre, urged the public to join the organization's efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats. We still haven't revealed the characteristics of populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects rape charges, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape accusations "slander" and said people were "trying to get attention" using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspicions.
American Catherine Mayorga accused the Portuguese striker and Juventus football club of rape in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to the magazine Der Spiegel on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $ 375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were brought, Ronaldo, 33, appealed to 142 million of his fans in a video broadcast on Instagram, calling the corresponding messages a “slander.”
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are a defamation,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to profit from me, but situations like this are part of my job.
I'm a happy person and I'm fine," the footballer added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published accusations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the sphere of private life".
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the footballer would seek compensation for “moral damage in the amount that corresponds to the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the most high-profile cases of violation of personal rights in recent years.”
It is alleged that the incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anal raped her. Such evidence was transferred to the district court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the described incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees before her and said that he was a “99 percent good guy” who was disappointed by “one percent”.
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital, where the injuries she received were photographed. However, later she agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "fearful of revenge" and was afraid of "public humiliation".
Now the 34-year-old woman is seeking to cancel the previous arrangement, as she continues to suffer because of the incident, which she said took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing for the transfer to Real Madrid FC from Manchester United. This summer he became a player of the grand Italian football team Juventus, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “forever regret” the loss of automakers
Britain will "forever regret" if it loses the status of the world leader in the field of automotive production after Brexit. This is warned by the Minister of Economy Greg Clark.
He added that he was alarmed by the statement of representatives of Toyota UK, who told BBC journalists that in the event of a British exit from the EU without a deal, the company will be forced to suspend the production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Secretary Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis cars, last year produced about 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU urgently at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s CEO in Bernaston.
Other automakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain’s exit from the EU without a deal on international trade.
For example, BMW said that the production plant of the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates in the mode of prompt delivery of parts and materials according to needs – parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border in the supply of parts, which will lead to delays and shortages of materials.
According to the company, in the warehouse Toyota can be placed parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that the plan for the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "separately provides schemes to avoid problems at the border."
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal that, in my opinion, will allow not only to succeed at the moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimonials from Toyota and other automakers, we absolutely need to keep our highly efficient supply chains in place.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long term, it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will reduce jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, head of the Unite professional union organizing committee at the Bernaston plant, who has worked here for 24 years, said the other participants were extremely concerned: “I can say from experience that the job cuts are not being restored.”
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan for shaping our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, says White House
White House officials said on Sunday that Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as discussions over Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Supreme Court judge continue.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For several months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of dismissing the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the presidency under the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday, he visited the White House amid reports that an official was about to step down.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a timing match with a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blazey Ford, were to testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect that it will be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I'm constantly making sure that the press has the latest information."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the infrequent briefings were not related to the dislike of "playing in public" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they are playing in public."
Then she suggested that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president before him,” she said, adding, without citing the source: “Statistics speak for themselves.”
Sanders noted that the briefings will still be held, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask questions to the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
We try to communicate often with the press. This should be especially noticeable over the past few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the President of the United States is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences with high-level guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is so, behaving in front of journalists loosely and sometimes strangely.
The Secretary of State for Health of Scotland addressed in a letter to workers from the EU in connection with concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries working for the National Health Service of Scotland to express their appreciation for their work and ask them to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to covering the cost of applications for permanent immigrant status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman noted: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit have continued. Already this autumn, appropriate decisions should be expected.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know this period can be very worrying for you.
That is why I would like to emphasize again how I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the health service for the benefit of patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We very much want you to stay."
Kristion Ebercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
The midfielder of the "Tennessee State Tigers" Kristion Ebercrombie underwent an urgent operation after getting a head injury in Sunday's match against Vanderbilt Commodores, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist of the newspaper Tennessee.
The head coach of the "Tennessee State Tigers" told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
“He went to the sidelines where he got sick,” Reid said.
On the sidelines, trainers and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking him on a stretcher for further examination.
A Tennessee State Tigers official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercrombie had operated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The team "Tennessee State Tigers" are trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-grader, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He made five intercepts of the ball on Sunday before dropping out of the game. Thus, for the season he has on the account of 18 intercepts.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more duty in case of purchase of real estate in the UK. According to the new plans of Tori, additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless
This measure neutralizes all attempts by Corbyn to attract young voters
Higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to raise an additional 120 million pounds per year to help the homeless
As Theresa May announced today, foreigners buying real estate in the UK will pay more tax. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
The move could be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of more affordable housing aimed at high-paying workers.
The tariff increase will apply to individuals and legal entities that do not pay taxes in the UK. The government will allocate additional funds to help those who are forced to spend the night in the open air.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of two years of antiquity on the second housing and real estate intended for rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to attract an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to experts, 13% of new real estate, which is being built in London, falls into the property of foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream about their own housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country, in particular, in the capital, are empty, since a large number of foreign buyers most of the time live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering state duties to make housing more accessible to young people.
He accused major construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying up land without further use. He urged Theresa May to abandon quotas for affordable real estate in order to correct the "disgraceful situation in the housing market" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important real estate reforms, including rent control and the impossibility of eviction without good reason.
He also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “I promised last year that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream – for every new generation, life should be better.
This requires changes in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who want to live, work and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same terms as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become unattainable. The problem of living in the open air is still very painful."
Jack Ross: “More than anything, I want to be the head coach of the Scottish national team”
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross says he is "above everything" to lead the Scottish national team someday.
The 42-year-old Scotsman has taken to rebuild the club from the north-east of the country, which now occupies the third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning St. Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got into Scotland’s second national team, but that’s the end of it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched the Scottish national team play at Hampden Park, and that always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful as the head coach of the club.”
Ross' predecessors at Sunderland include Dick the Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Ellardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gustavo Poet, and Paolo Di Canio.
The former head coach of Alloa Athletic says he did not feel the excitement of moving to a big club after such authoritative names, having previously rejected offers from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“At the current stage, I will consider it a success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and logistical support, this club, without a doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but I’m unlikely to see another result as a success for myself.”
Ross only three years building a coaching career. Before that, he worked as a second coach at FC Dumbarton, and also spent 15 months in the coaching staff of FC Harts.
He then helped "Alloa" recover after FC got into the third division, and the next season with "St. Mirren" went from the stage of departure to the title of the winners of the first division.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I found myself at a crossroads," he recalls, speaking about the transition to FC "Alloa".
“I truly believed that coaching was more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, I made good money on it and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many difficulties that we have to overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as a head coach I feel in my place.
I’ve always been interested in coaching, and I’ve never felt more comfortable in my adult life than when I chose this profession.”

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the ideal time for a mug of beer
The summer heat has helped to increase revenues for British pubs, which are going through bad times, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
According to estimates, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits decreased by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations, Peter Martin, from CGA, which advises on business development, said: “Due to the sunny weather and the longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup, July passed according to the same scheme as the previous month, when the revenue of pubs grew by 2.8%. But the restaurants did even worse.
The June drop of 1.8% in July intensified.
Pubs and bars focused on serving drinks, so far have the best indicators – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the loss of restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered from the heat, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% per month. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%. "
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM’s licensing and hospitality division, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sports events remain the main factors influencing sales in the domestic market.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to lose profits. The annual decline in sales by 4.8% causes special concern against the background of the need to reduce costs.
The long hot summer is not the best time for food service establishments. We will see if the milder temperature we observed in August will give them the much needed rest."
The overall growth in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, in July was 2.7%, reflecting a slowdown in the launch of new brands.
The industry indicator of Coffer Peach Tracker sales in the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups, the total turnover of which exceeds <0xC2><0xA3> 9 billion. This is a generally accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents
According to the results of the study, one in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, has a hidden account in social networks from parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
20% of students reported having a “main account” that they show to their parents
One in five children, sometimes under the age of 11, create a social media account that hides from adults.
The study, which included 20,000 high school students, showed an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram, a social network for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean “main” account that they show to their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who accidentally stumbled upon the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw a call to “rape me.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two social media profiles. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is secret.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: “We are deeply concerned that many teenagers are keen to create an online space where parents and teachers will not be able to find them.
Eileed Doyle will become a “representative of the interests of athletes” in the board of Scottish Athletics
Eileed Doyle was elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as an independent director during the annual general meetings of the board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete. Ian Beatty, the chairman of the board, called the move a great opportunity for those who lead the sports movement to take advantage of its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Ailede has great respect among the athletes of Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that, by involving her in the Council, athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit," said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
The American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is now a sports columnist for the BBC, has lost the opportunity to walk due to a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
Doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely. I learned to walk again and today I perform dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!”
In advertising milk suction cup women compared with cows – opinions of Internet users divided
The manufacturer of milk suction cups was faced with an ambiguous reaction of Internet users to advertising in which young mothers are compared with active cows.
To mark the release of the product, dubbed "the world's first silent breast milk extractor", consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous music video ad to demonstrate the freedom that a new suction cup gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn to a song containing the words: "Yes, I feed myself, but I do not have a tail" and "As you can see, it is not the udder, but my breasts."
Then the choir sings: "Suck, suck, to feed the children. Suck, suck, so that the milk is not wasted."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked a heated discussion online.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users was ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
“It’s not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are vilely taken away from them a few days after birth,” one user wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor can be easily hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here is another comment: "It is clear that this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not engage them to advertise a milk suction cup for women who need to feed their babies?”
Someone else added: "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users defended the ad. One of the women video seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would certainly have bought such a thing if I were still breastfeeding.
By sucking the milk, I felt like a cow.
The advertising is a bit crazy, but I did not look for hidden content in it.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “Funny advertising focused on moms who suck milk (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertising is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suction cups hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, the suction cup Elvie works absolutely silently, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a feeding bra. Thanks to this, women can move freely, keep children and even go outside.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: “The Elvie suction cup is such a revolutionary product that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Drawing a parallel between milk-squeezing women and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new suction cup would bring.
The suction cup Elvie is not the first time in the headlines.
As part of Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk with this product during the show of clothes from fashion designer Marta Jakubovska.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have made it more difficult to place children in care.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country, offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Control, testified to Congress that Bureau staffers arrested dozens of people who applied for care for unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
"About 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are in the country illegally. Many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
According to asylum workers, to speed up the handling of children’s cases, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of the children to appear in court within a month after detention, rather than 60 days as they did before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than come to court in person to prove their legal status to immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to asylum will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and official data from responsible officials in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends, we risk intensifying the trauma that many of them have already suffered.
Syria orders U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw troops immediately
In addition, speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so “the attitude to them will be appropriate.”
“They should leave immediately and not put conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the “war on terrorism is actually over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have fled their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In the war-ravaged country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
Regarding refugees, Muallem assured that the country had created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of spreading "unreasonable fears" that refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help bring people back,” he said.
“We are seeing an attempt to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide Syria with assistance in rebuilding the country until a political agreement has been reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats will report that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major stronghold of the rebels, has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front militants, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in order to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create conditions for elections.
Muallem put forward conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying his work should be limited to "revision of the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020, if, as many liberal spectators are likely to hope, he will not take office early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be “the most dramatic end to the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not give signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (up to 1.05 million) on CNN and actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the ranking with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news is discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our understanding,” said Neil Behr, executive producer of the ABC drama The Last Candidate, about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist writer and author of “Only Funny Moments: And a Few Strict Truths About Penetrating a Hollywood Men’s Club,” offers a different theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Skovell told me.
Chaos is fun.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, stories from Washington are able to determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of reunification of immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Withdrawal is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet you can’t say that you’re just trying to stay informed when you watch a group of experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “well-informed” sources for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (“clothes for the arrogant” – so the Washington Post described it) and the aftermath of the shocks.
For me, Super Mario will never be the same again.
“The feeling of reality shows is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the TV program “Stars of the Pawnshop”, about rotations in the cast and daily plot twists in the show “Trump” (conflict with the NFL).
If you allow yourself to miss at least one episode, you can hopelessly lag behind.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fleiss at his house on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27°C), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV — not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging in the balance.
“I remember when we were making all those crazy shows and people were saying that this was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Mr. Fleis told me.
"I took it as a joke, but they seemed to be right."

External influx of funds into the toughest midterm elections to Congress
Not surprisingly, in the 17th district of Pennsylvania, additional money is sent, because due to the revision of the boundaries of the electoral districts, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
In the fight for this suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, enters the Democrat, Member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfs, now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were reworked after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election race in the new 17th district sparked a fierce confrontation between the financial divisions of the major parties, the Democratic Party Committee on Congressional Elections (DCCC) and the Republican National Committee (NRCC).
The name Lemba became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th arrondissement with a minimal advantage during the additional congressional elections in March, which enjoyed wide public attention.
This place belonged to the Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won this district with an advantage of 20 points.
Political experts gave a slight preference to the Democrats.
In the United States considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but changed his mind
The diplomats recalled the weak resistance from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which previously supported the position of Beijing.
In June 2017, Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Previously, Trump also had a hotel in Panama, until partners evicted staff hired by the Trump Organization.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Gezer Nauert said earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
According to the results of internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference devoted to security and economic prosperity. A similar event was held last year, and it was seen as a step forward in efforts to contain the flow of migrants to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the issue of sanctions against El Salvador stopped at this point.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, as a sign that the administration considers the event very important.
At the same time, three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, because there were no new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of internal discussions reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next trouble could be the report of special counsel Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a strong confirmation of why can be found in the now available public information.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly examining a possible link between Trump’s campaign and an attack on our voting system by Russia.
If the influence in Congress goes into other hands, Trump will have to report to Congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, to one-partyers.
There are many “ifs” in this case, and I don’t want to say that the fall of Trump is inevitable, as are his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make a choice that will determine the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West began to resist him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The course of history is determined by such turning points, and the unbridled movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
The Americans are now waiting for several such turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr. Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein got into trouble when the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on the inconsistency of Trump's office.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the investigation into Brett Kavanaugh, who recently launched the FBI, proves to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Kavanaugh’s candidacy for office in the Supreme Court is approved despite convincing allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, above all, will we vote for those members of Congress who can hold Trump accountable in the medium term?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Saturday candles on the swastika table.
With such a legacy, can I not look optimistically into the future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about meeting with the Vienna Rapids
FC Rangers hosts Rapid (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances to withdraw from Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a match with Villarreal, which ended with 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve more.
“It was a good result for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to the game with the hope of getting something and got one point.
Maybe at the end of the match we could come forward, but in general, a draw, probably, can be considered a fair result.
In the first half the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we will be able to get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future opponents showed a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give a fight and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great line-up and all the guys are happy. The training is going well.
I hope we can go further, leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize self-care, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not in a hurry to start a conversation on the subject,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care if you do not communicate your wishes to relatives in advance.
Consult your counselor and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Engage a financial advisor: he can advise a way to cover the relevant costs.
Long-term care funding sources include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-insurance at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal trouble in advance.
Prepare a power of attorney for your representative, who will supervise your medical care and ensure that specialists will fulfill your wishes in case you can not do it in person.
In addition, we advise to issue a power of attorney for the disposal of funds.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in case of your incapacity.
Do not forget about the minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical care, so he is taken to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down such information to be ready.
"It's not just about finances. It's about who the doctors are," says Martin,
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog.
Prepare such a plan.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired a pneumatic rifle several times
The man fired a pneumatic rifle several times as he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 02:30 British summer time, as an “accident”.
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life-threatening, and police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, government officials said, but the death toll could rise.
Due to the failure of communications, officials dealing with humanitarian aid issues cannot obtain any information from the Regency of Dongala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some basic facts about the city of Palu and the Regency of Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 according to data for 2017.
When there was an earthquake that caused a tsunami, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that stretches for more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
According to data for 2017, the regency, an administrative region located in the lower part of the province, has about 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main economic sectors of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster alleviation agency, Palu and Dongala have been affected by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami in Dongala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Donggal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked southern Java, Indonesia's most densely populated island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.6.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake rocked one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hits the Pidjaya Regency in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic due to the fact that people have not yet forgotten the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not leave the island at once.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a police report released Saturday by the state of Alaska, 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the report of the incident and resisting the arrest.
According to a police report, when a familiar woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the detention center Matanuska-Susitna with the right to make a pledge of $ 500.
He was brought to justice on Saturday, where he declared himself “innocent” when asked if he admitted his guilt, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, with a one-year arrest and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with class B misdemeanors, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as interfering with the reporting of domestic violence and carrying a gun in a state of intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s brutal behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused a tsunami: killed hundreds of people
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications networks and power supplies have failed, and the number of victims may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, which is distributed on social networks, shows the moment when the element struck.
Hundreds of people gathered for the festival on the beach of the city of Palu, when a tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspected terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, a 30-year-old pickup truck rented at Home Depot, was said to have taken a bicycle path along a highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started shooting down cyclists and pedestrians who had hit him along the way.
According to a notice of intent to seek execution filed in the Southern District of New York state to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court materials, each of these indictments provides for the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of extortion, which are usually brought by federal prosecutors in cases related to organized crime, as well as charges of violence and destruction of vehicles.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipov’s crime as “terrible, brutal and malicious,” the attack was the result of “careful planning and premeditated intent.”
The victims that Saifulla Habibullaevich Saipov inflicted injury, harmed or killed were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lara Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Ehrlich, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pajando
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York last opened a criminal case that is punishable by the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case was carried out in New York in 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court materials, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show remorse in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told the investigators that he does not regret what he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to conduct an attack on the ISIS video, which he watched on his phone.
Police say he also asked for the Islamic State flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “very disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea and awarding a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only intensify the psychological trauma caused by these events to all victims,” Patton said.
The defense side of Saipov earlier also asked the accusers not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP believes that NAJEL FARAJA should be appointed responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest rally at the Conservative Party Congress, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former leader of the United Kingdom's Independence Party said politicians should "feel the pressure" of eurosceptics, as one of the MPs, Theresa May, proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "already work out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
Attention to the problems that May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks was even more drawn by the fact that MPs from the Conservative Party, who oppose the exit, joined a special protest rally in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is struggling to implement Chequers’ compromise plan, despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those opposed to the exit, and the EU.
Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos”.
At a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Bone said he wanted to "opt out of Chequers".
He invited Mr. Faraj to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for this, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to give up Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said: "We fought in world wars not to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and do not want to leave is absolutely not true.”
Conservative Party member and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists who are actually walking the streets and fighting for the votes of voters.
Please drop Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: "Prime Ministers retain their office when they keep their promises."
Mr Farage said politicians should “feel pressure” if they are going to back down on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it is a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to say that they will not get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel the pressure.
We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never calm down until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit marched through Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives because security concerns arose after the opening of the conference because of their party program.
“These are people who are telling us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing good in Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “seriously think” about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that during a general meeting in West Massachusetts on Saturday, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told about its future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Party member Jeff Deale, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It is considered as the main candidate that can fight with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general meeting since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she planned to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that “it’s time for women to go to Washington and get the government working, and for that, a woman should be at the head.”
Suspect arrested in shooting murder of basketball player LSY Tigers Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead on the campus of the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," Murphy Police Chief J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wade gave in to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the crime scene, carrying a weapon and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Button County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 stars last season and averaged 17.4 minutes per game on the field, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton reduced the backlog in the fight for the world title after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Walteri Bottas left behind Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ team decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from pole positions and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position in the first two corners and gave Vettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which had to decide everything.
The Mercedes pilot drove another round and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke into the leader after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior due to the risk of being clamped, after the result of a double maneuver he managed to break out ahead in the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
Potov led most of the race, as he did not change tires to quickly reach the finish line and move Kimi Räikkönen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped for a pit stop on the 44th lap, but was unable to increase the pace to the last eight, thanks to which Räikkönen took fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri taught full time on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to drive.
The team did exceptional work to get first and second place,” said Hamilton.
The body language didn’t impress.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm stance that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, who accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh of sexual violence.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about the events in the Senate, which, according to him, demonstrated human “detestability, disgust and deceitfulness.”
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the Senate over the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who are displaying detestability, disgust and deceit,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the published information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t disclose.”
Wait a minute.
Did we disclose? ... No, we did not disclose,” he added, copying the senator’s behavior.
In July, Feinstein received a letter detailing the charges filed by Ford against Cavanaugh, and in early September his content was made public, but Feinstein denied that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s accusations, I didn’t disclose the information I received from her,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objections did not seem to appeal to the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “I’ll tell you, her body language was not impressive at all.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but I haven’t seen anyone do it worse yet.”
While continuing to defend a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the allegations for their own ends.
“They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
You see the ugliness, the ugliness, they do not care who to offend, who to step over in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite quotes the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants, 5:3
Giants player Patrick Dwyer scored two goals in a match against Dundee
The Dundee Stars were rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league from the Belfast Giants, winning Saturday's match-response with a score of 5:3.
The Giants gained an early two-legged lead thanks to the throws of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilliers.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney equalized the score in the home game, and then Dwyer again brought the Giants forward.
Dandy player Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third defeat in the elite league season for Adam Keefe, who won a 2–1 victory over Dundee on Friday night in Belfast.
This is the fourth meeting of the teams in the season. Three previous matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer dropped the first puck in the fourth minute (3:35) after the transfer of Kendall McFall, and four minutes later Beauvillier, who received the puck from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period in the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to the game, and in the sixteenth minute (15:16) Coney, having received a puck from Matt Markwardt, leveled the score.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break, throwing his second puck at the end of the first period.
The hosts of the field regrouped, and Bushar in the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again leveled the score, throwing the puck when his team prevailed numerically.
Thanks to the efforts of Coney and Charles Corcoran, Nielsen brought Dundee forward for the first time at the end of the second period and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, will play an away match against Milton Keynes.
Air traffic controller killed so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid an earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped take off a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people were killed and many missing after a severe tsunami-induced earthquake struck Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong tremors continue to shake the area, with many people trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues, who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the control tower, which was heavily swayed, at Mutiara SIS Al Jufry Airport in Palu.
He stayed in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, had safely taken off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
The representative of the Indonesian company-supplier of air navigation services Johannes Searight said that this decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which is to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands as the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims may increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said in a statement.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, which will host mass funerals on Sunday.
Military and passenger aircraft deliver aid and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Each minute an ambulance delivers bodies.
There is no clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is in a hurry to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we do not know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and appealed to the country’s military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
A plane crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the plane fell into the lagoon one man went missing
The airline, which carried out the flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person has gone missing, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it was unable to find a single passenger as of Saturday.
The airline says its representatives are trying to find a husband and cooperate with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to do so.
The airline did not immediately respond to the request for more detailed information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low above the ground.
"That's very good," Janes said.
Janes said that he and the others managed to get to the emergency exits on a sinking plane being up to the belt in the water.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who worked near the berth modernization also helped in the rescue operation, bringing people to shore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in plane crashes involving PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but Air Niugini is not on this list.
An analyst has restored the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told jury members how he used cell phone records to recreate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett, according to The Clarion Ledger, said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his previous claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors were asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was at Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "false because my pickup was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Gale said.
The defense has to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The trio of hip-hop performers wants to challenge the negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed argues that hip-hop has changed its nature by moving away from political ideas and struggling to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently witnessed a revival of this trend in the United Kingdom thanks to bands such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for dismissal, receiving a “racist” message
In New York, the nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an incorrectly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit with “extortion”.
Linsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was black.
"NO, THAT'S ONE DARK SKIR," Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flexman felt "inconvenient" and fired Ms. Maurice. She stated that their previous nanny, who was African-American, was poorly performing her job and that in return she was expecting a nanny from the Philippines.
Miss Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple, hoping to get a refund for the release in the amount of the salary she would have received for six months of work with the spouse, for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract. She had to pay350 dollars a day.
“I want to show them that you don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to accusations that they were racist, the couple said the release of Maurice was a wise decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being offended.
“My wife didn’t mean what she sent her.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with a person you treated rudely, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your own baby?
Forgiveness."
Comparing the lawsuit with “repression,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and had “not recovered yet.”
"Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to a new letter, Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the idea with a bear that is able to speak
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to be printed, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now that’s funny, because we know about the huge success that Paddington has had.”
Talking about her father, who worked as a BBC operator before a little toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, she was optimistic that his work was rejected, sharing how on the 60th anniversary of the book's release she simultaneously felt "joy and sadness" because her father died a year ago.
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a rather modest man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, like his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not their, and not our victories.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington is a creation of his imagination, he has always attributed success to him."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the 2nd Louis Pasteur Hospital in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
"He called me regularly, said it was really bad, that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs Eden-Laperouse.
"And then Nad called me and said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medicine that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped working and left the body.
She died some time before it was shut down.
I just had to sit and wait, knowing what was going on at this time.
I could not mourn, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold myself in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Eden-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, ignoring the severe tests she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I lowered my head and couldn't hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply sorry for Nada.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women who have suffered grief leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave postcards on a Welsh bridge with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would please inspire them.
Miss Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lydna, said that her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that that smile made every room brighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, found his brother’s body after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says: “I’m constantly afraid that it will have consequences.”
Ms. Davis created postcards, “so people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
“Don’t worry about yourself, you have to talk.”
Miss Humphreys, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he had changed."
And on Christmas Day, he finally lost his spirit. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eyes or anything. "
She said his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to endure it: “It has imposed a devastating
follow the family.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance: FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we asked for – a limited investigation in time and nature – we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “collapsing” amid a hopeless loss of allegiance to the political party.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is related to time.
Interim elections will take place in just five weeks, November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to conduct their own person through the elections to the Supreme Court of the country.
George W. Bush called the senators to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked at the White House under Mr. Bush and through whom he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Cavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the Supreme Court.
During the reign of Kim, the number of defectors from North Korea “reduced”
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Pion Seug, citing data from the Unification Ministry of the Republic of South Korea, said that last year the number of defectors was 1,127, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that smugglers carrying illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang refrained from public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than the well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issues of denuclearization, negotiations on which came to a standstill.
This happened after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of lacking progress since then, amid sanctions.
“With no confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament,” Ri Yong-ho said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I kept thinking that if a woman ever acted like that, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Cavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly denounced the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him an “absurd and coordinated destruction of reputation” orchestrated by liberals who were angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss to the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias towards Democrats.
“I think that with these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, he will personally withdraw his candidacy,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if his guilt was confirmed, and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll say this: If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to work not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the Row v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval in office, Kavanaugh circumvented the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
“This is not the time when a hysterical, biased person will become the judge and we will tell you how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
Women should have these weapons.
These are just words that contained months and years of rage, and she could not utter them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "A woman who worked as an executive somewhere and helped me a lot said that she was also crying when she got angry, but she had her own technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor, 'You might think I'm sad and that's why I'm crying.
I am angry.”
And after that, she just continued.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of my first job in an office that was mostly men’s work was when one day I cried with indescribable anger, and the older woman, an unwelcome manager I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the collar and dragged me to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they got to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he retired from the race, a deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there was no reason why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with laughter after 30 years.
"Seven other candidates have already participated in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since this was at the end of the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she made a promise to herself that she would not take part in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had no regrets in supporting the men for $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think they’ll give me a discount?” she asked.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, disappointment with the system, which made it very difficult to collect money and forced to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies, as well as anger at sexism. She was ready to cry.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking about what they would write on my tombstone?
“She was crying?”
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and although it is still far from over, in the long run the split between the countries may benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made the first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation worsened this week due to new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually tax half of all goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing paid back the same coin each time, recently imposing a five to ten percent tariff on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to keep that promise anytime soon.
To force Washington to retreat is to accept the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, US public worship is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, pressure in the trade war with the United States can bring China an advantage in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And this is actually a greater threat than observers have previously recognized,” said analyst Abigail Grace, who deals with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
The foreign minister said that Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited the means of subsistence.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance in rebuilding the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that support the riot.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018, when they defeated the US team with a final score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who tried his best for most of the tournament, scored his first long shot on the 16th hole of par-3 in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of four players ever to score 5–0–0 since the tournament began in its modern format in 1979.
American Jordan Spit lost 5:4 from the player with the lowest rating in the European team of Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who takes the first place in the world ranking, lost 2-1 to Jan Poulter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a Ryder Cup veteran who has already participated in the tournament eight times, became the European who won tournaments the most times in all time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a tough year.
Thank you to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so glad, so glad to get the cup back.
This is the merit of the team and I am glad that I was able to help,” Garcia said, without restraining his emotions after winning in Europe.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Rem, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a singles game with a score of 2:1.
“I feel incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup 13–21–3.
Strange statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team tried to reach the Fairway area all weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furrick said of his team after a disappointing performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we did not dominate Europe for a long time.
We fought.
I take my hat off in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the U.S. Professional Golfers Association and the Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
We cannot fail to praise them.
We lost."
Up-to-date information about the red tide: decrease in concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in the level of red-colored microorganisms in parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the abundant flowering conditions reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties indicate a decrease in concentration.
The flowering of red microorganisms extends about 130 miles of coastline from the north of Pinellas to the southern districts of Lee.
Spots can be found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, it was reported that there was an average concentration in Pinellas County and in its coastal zone, a low to high concentration in Hillsborough County, a high concentration in Manat County, a high concentration in Sarasota County and in its coastal zone, and an average concentration in Charlotte County and Highland County.
In Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties continue to report respiratory irritation.
No such reports were reported in northwest Florida last week.
