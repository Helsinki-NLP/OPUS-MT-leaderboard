28-year-old chef found dead at San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim’s brother says he can’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting: “Finally, things were going well for him.”
"The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia," the San Francisco forensics office said in a statement.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galizia, told ABC's KGO television and radio station in San Francisco that Frank, a past-time chef on the Boston distribution line, had received his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and depressed" by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be greatly missed,” he said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in hostels, but recently "he finally got things right."
“He found an apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galizia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of connecting with the family has always been to cook us a dish, to cook us a dinner,” said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who sailed the stream.
“With all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that unbounded diamond that shined brightly every day,” he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.

Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, which leads to slow development.
Greenlandic female sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest of all vertebrate animals lives the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest person known to scientists was just over 210 years old.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary for us not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get recommendations from a doctor, how to live, so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, it should not be dismissed.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And stress is experienced by about 90% of those who come.
And the most affected are people from large cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself time to rest.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with children, you do not have to part with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are wellness programs, which include both diagnostic services, pediatrician's consultation, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor taking into account individual indications and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend game classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with babies, provide the necessary conditions for infants and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
Soft winter, long summer, abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasus Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are carried out indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium and resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of mature age.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasus Mineral Waters, of course, therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various systems of the body.
Water differs in temperature, amount of salts, total mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects water depending on the patient's well-being.
Thus, "Narzan" has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory action, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki Nova" has an anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have the "Slavyanovskaya" water.
When prescribing water, the doctor necessarily takes into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it picks up less salty water because the salts retain the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
The reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and a specific temperature.
Now in sanatoriums are available and various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of healing based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, mud from which is useful for the joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorbing, immunomodulating effect.
These are wellness walks on individually drawn routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in close proximity to the mineral spring "Narzan".
There you can also take baths of wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, sage-lacquer, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Prolonged fruiting.
What to do to make the harvest go until the end of the season?
Yulia Belopukhov, agronomist and summer cottager, tells.
High-sized tomatoes it is time to arrange a haircut: remove new stepchildren, cut off the tops, remove all the leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries - do not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants, are fed with an ash-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparations (breeder - to accelerate the infusion and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyte - from diseases, Immunocytophyte - to increase immunity).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer should be used only copper sulfur, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We're doing the last watering of the plants.
Long braided cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wallpaper so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of Zircon, sprinkle the stem with 5-7 cm of compost.
To prolong the fruiting of the zucchini is also easy: cut the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against night colds, install an arc with a shelter material over the bed.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
Signs of an end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation shows a positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development also announced the stabilization of the situation recently.
There is slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
"The index estimate of Russian GDP shows that the recession is behind, and ahead - slow growth of the economy," - said in the bulletin of the Bank of Russia "What are the trends talking about."
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter was raised by the regulator to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter the decline of the Russian GDP stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April, it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15," the representative of the mayor of RIA Novosti said.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that “the bottom has passed”.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If you make an amendment to the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be halved due to an additional working day.
Add to this the lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality," explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, reducing the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2%, compared with 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, Rosstat has been recording deflation for the past two weeks.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August from the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy," Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April, Russia has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive dynamics is also demonstrated by the situation in the labor market, where the unemployment rate fell to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favorable situation in the labor market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population leaves much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor may hamper the recovery of the economy, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia’s tough policy can also be called a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
The negative factor is the insufficiently high level of investment, which restrains the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015, "says Irina Rogova, analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly adopted in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is not yet so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and former foreigners, in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians perform under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Some parents moved to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone did not withstand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone believed that the best conditions for development in sports would be created abroad.
AiF.ru found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of the 27-year-old girl says that her name is Lisa Red.
She was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a pole.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbaeva.
“Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio, Lisa will be our only countrywoman, though former, in the six-point jumping sector.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbaeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious evangelical propagandists.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, there were eight other children in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena began to get involved in the fight at school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the U.S. Wrestling Training Center she continued classes under the guidance of another former Russian Vladislav Izbonikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost her first fight.
At the World Cup that year, it was a win.
By the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 World Cup.
After that, there were bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where for the first time and met with synchronized swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the family of the girl decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
Mary continued her studies there.
Soon she was already part of the US national team and showed great results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, Russian synchronists cannot compete, but for America, its indicators are a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldybina received at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue training the girl artistic gymnastics across the ocean.
Until this moment, the girl was engaged in a favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, of course, she did not have to fight, but for the United States, she organized a real breakthrough - brought a star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artists" - Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the national team of Germany.
She was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to enter the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonova.
If the ways of emigration of the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira is still training in Russia - she specially comes to her homeland to not lose her skills.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in a personal all-rounder.
There is very little information about Maria Ugolkova’s swimmer in the Russian information space.
For a very long time Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time it performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a record of the country at the distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to perform under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4<0xC3><0x97>100 integrated relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6,000 francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time winner of the European Championships, a champion of Russia, a master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped joining our national team, it was time to think about a change of nationality.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports ground.
The triumphant return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov was already represented by Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, at home is known even less than about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to practice gymnastics.
He has not achieved much international success.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualification on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Naste, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In a duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
In the solo program, she was fifth.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kruyter plays for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry already became the champion of the country.
That same year, he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Kruyter also won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jump.
The 31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who after long performances for Russia decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk High School of Sportsmanship, in 2011 he even became the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family remained there for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, which was held on the territory of his new homeland.
Hadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got together with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get into this northern country - I had to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimhan continued to learn free-fighting.
He soon won the Junior World Championship and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a free fight, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - about Taimuraz Friev.
He was granted Spanish citizenship at the end of December 2012 and currently plays for the Spanish national team.
Before that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to celebrate high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the country's championships in 2007 and 2008.
Statutory of non-matches in the national team, Timuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan Makhachkala, - Artur Bijarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, started boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 he became the world champion of youth.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why are Cossack children in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "the Kazakhs should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically."
They should grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far, I think, this work is being done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes absorb all the positive that was accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything is rushed and it is not known how, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country’s economy.
There is an encroachment on funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, excessive tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the field of housing and communal services.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid more than 170 million rubles to energy companies.
Recently, the prosecutor’s office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of the inclusion of unreasonable costs in the tariffs.
And in the cost of LLC "IV-consulting" (for cold water supply) were laid 4 million rubles. for renting cars at a price higher than the market.
There are many examples of this in the country.
The people give the last money for the "municalka", and pays correctly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is accused immediately of several articles of the Criminal Code: waste, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually performed, but was paid.
Businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
And as the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent them on their own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and tenants - millions of rubles.
Makarov’s scheme of machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who appropriated the money of citizens, swept through the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kochan, by the way, also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of machinations on 91,7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013 in Elizovo Kamchatka region he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, the other two played the role of settlement and cash centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, energy A. Kochan did not transfer funds, but spent on himself, his beloved.
Judging in the field of housing is quite difficult.
Things don't get excited, they drag on.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of NP "ZhKh Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one, which should make the previous one work.
Specialists, including among judges, on housing issues are also few.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities is given very little attention.
Refusals to initiate criminal cases, about trawls during investigations are also said in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 crimes in production in 2015, less than half were sent to court.
The remainder of the investigation was protracted and one in five was suspended due to the failure to identify the accused.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the authorities are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of fakes - only 60 criminal cases were opened.
For 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
And what is the falsification of the protocol of the gathering of tenants?
This means: a change in the management of the house, financial and other issues go bypassing the opinion of the owners.
And it also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, and not "milk" the population, cannot break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that the tenants are in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses too.
First of all, due to the eradication of corruption as such throughout the state, Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property Issues, is sure.
And now this work is actively carried out.
It’s not just a single action, it’s a targeted anti-corruption course.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital scandals and does not smell.
Why are there no such scandals in Moscow in the sphere of housing and communal services as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital's government has shown iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Electoral, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean both the personnel issue, and the legislative amendments, and the legal education.
Management companies are under close supervision, and they have all gone through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (and appeals of tenants, and response measures are posted on the portal of the government of Moscow).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but carefully monitor what is written there, how the house is contained.
Awareness among the population of the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow is checking the validity of tariffs for housing and utilities - after all, a large part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together and explains the calm situation in Moscow.
Does everything depend on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the involuntary should change the place of work?
The Turkish Gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the United States, offering to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of orchestrating a coup.
He said this while speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged Americans to give up their support for the “fethullahist terrorist organization.”
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and may lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
Either FETO, which is organising the coups, or democratic Turkey.
She has to make that choice,” Erdogan’s address in Ankara on Wednesday evening was quoted by the Anatolian news agency as saying.
The President of Turkey once again, but already more strongly demanded from the United States to comply with his demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
On the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army made an attempt to overthrow the legitimate power in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan addressed the population, the insurgency was suppressed and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, there were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States.
Supporters of Erdogan also admitted that the coup may be directly involved in the Americans.
The United States denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising a change of tone.
The latest statement of representatives of the State Department in this regard was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg on Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the Turkish president – he insists on his own and also puts forward demands on his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfil its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not set a date for the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Celik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara's amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe's own security.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open its borders to migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement last Wednesday, allowing Turkey to withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish foreign minister did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not meet the expected support from him.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sphere is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but the results did not satisfy us, and we began to look for others,” he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks of Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the reorientation of the country to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise Evgeny Minchenko believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both from the point of view of business and from the point of view of military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post," the expert explained.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about the non-payment of EU compensation, about the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both the United States and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him precisely on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on," he said.
The head of the Center for political information Alexey Muhin admits that the President of Turkey will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it benefits him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was extremely tough on Russia and sought favor in the West by all means.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after some time the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think that Erdogan entered the period of shuttle diplomacy.
Being between the two poles, the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself,” said Muhin.
According to him, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert believes.
Another point of view is held by the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazov.
Turkey’s relations with both the EU and the United States are quite tense now, and this is primarily due to the domestic policy that Erdogan personally pursues.
I think that this crisis in relations will be aggravated, and against the background of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reboot politics both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, the relations with Israel have been settled, there is an active political cooperation with Iran," Glazova said, admitting that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
It was then that Turkey began to develop very actively its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region in the position of “zero problems with its neighbors”.
There have been very successful visits by the President of Turkey to Russia and African countries.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to the strengthening of Turkey's positions both on the regional and international arena," the expert said.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its former relationship with the EU, but the question now is whether the EU will begin to respond firmly to Turkey, which can open borders to migrants and thus create serious problems for Europe.
Junior Doctors Strike: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors asked the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Junior Physicians Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask its full advice to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
In July, junior doctors and medical students voted to cancel an employment contract deal agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members participating in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government continued to “persistently remain silent” about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of the JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request to the extraordinary BMA Council meeting to approve a continuous program to expand collective protests starting in early September.
The dispute led to young doctors taking part in six strikes this year, including the first general strike in the history of the Public Health Service.
BMA’s chief medical officer, Dr. Joan Malavana, resigned after voting to repeal the agreed terms of the employment contract recommended by the BMA.
He told members of the BMA that the deal was a good one to accept, during meetings ahead of the vote of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health care workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: The “Bad Alliance”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare an official end to an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a lasting impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile seemed tense, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
By contrast, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly spoken of his “dear friend” Mr. Putin — five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia would return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm meant the opposite.
But the protracted chill coming from Mr. Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at the time was furious.
Mr. Putin burst into an angry tirade, accusing Ankara of striking Moscow in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on the alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media carried out a staggering, total offensive on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be blamed for everything.
The most serious were accusations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family had profited from the illegal trade in oil from Syria’s so-called Islamic State-controlled areas.
He denies this decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, an official signal was received that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting happened only because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of a kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a truce are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted from his post last month in an attempted coup.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have obviously shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will of course feel relieved when flights finally resume.
They are at the peak of the end of the season in the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," the Vedomosti newspaper said in a report.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her prolonged resentment at the turtle-like pace of the EU accession talks and Mr. Putin’s move — which seeks to take advantage of the cold and gradually destroy Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an “alliance of the bad”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial talks, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they didn’t even touch on the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the possibility of a total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter – it’s definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of a back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
The bank has retreated from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer lending brands.
He was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship for international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been decided that it is right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller brands for private banking that will gain more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt’s Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview during a tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one where our staff will be employed, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
I say now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their population groups, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
“This is the right time for us to move the brand bank, as basically (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and would have closed all those brands.
But with the work we’ve done focusing on customer needs rather than our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a victory in Newmarket on Passion
Dettori splashes champagne after doubling in Newmarket leads him to 3,000 victories
Jockey Frankie Dettori scored his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home track – the Passion trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth races.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Iddery, and Willie Carson.
Three-time Jockey Champion Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said, “It’s something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, since this is where I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big secular event, it’s not Royal Ascot — it’s a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am free from business and very unpretentious.
Dettori accepts applause when leads Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys reached this mark in the race with obstacles: the champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 victories in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he has reached this mark, which so few have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical wit that distinguishes him from others in the weight room.
He is a great representative for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans in this sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he would have brought 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and big races!
And seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for British racing, but moreover, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a branded rapid jump from a horse
From fast-paced finishes to fast-paced jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many of the winners of the big races, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was in disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month disqualification, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished yet for a while — Dettori said earlier that he would like to continue to participate in the competition, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration Sergey Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed Environment and Transport Representative.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration," but did not name the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Mr. Vyno, 44, former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, Estonia in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the administration of the protocol of the president and the apparatus of the government, reports the website of the Kremlin (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin: “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling how your instructions are carried out.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked for his dismissal from the post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do Smiles Convince?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin’s closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned on his own will.
But despite the smile on the camera, it has convinced few here – especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So are these the unforeseen consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement — that the man who was once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia’s environmental policy — was met with great skepticism.
In remarks to Putin quoted on the Kremlin’s website, Ivanov said: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you in a conversation to entrust me with this very difficult position, even a troubled one, for four years.
Well, it turns out that I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB’s State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed its deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time it was believed that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after Putin’s second term, since a third term for Putin would be contrary to the constitution.
However, this post was occupied by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after only three and a half years.
"Think Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with a producer
Gibson was involved in a show fight in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologised on Thursday before his removal was announced.
There were creative differences in the filming and differences of opinion.
I regret that this has happened,” he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson’s character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to come later, according to statements by ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love Thinking Like a Criminal and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I had hoped to be there until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans the show could only dream of.
The show is scheduled to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mysteries: Fish landed in Banff Garden
A man from Banff sought help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could have been sand squirrels left by a water squirrel.
Bane, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a picture of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern span and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct — which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four junctions between the "windows of the canvas" that are now approaching completion near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 tons of bridge.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Quinsferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of truly epic scale in this project, where more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel have been used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
A total of about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas concrete coating is poured in Rosate today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to rise to the place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first shutdown on each bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this closure represents the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north — or facing the shore — side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large-scale and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the 222-metre-long viaduct weighs about 6,000 tons and was supposed to be raised at an inclination angle of about 3%.
Elegant, because the tolerances the team worked on were tiny — just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, it all went very well.
Salvation in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'lucky to stay alive'
The three men were "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday after the team saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to swim to safety while their ship continued on its course.
“We saw their ship circling next to them and assumed the worst,” said Vince Jones, a steering rescue boat at Moelfre.
“Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind had carried him away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, and a third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and stranded in a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were lifted aboard a coastal lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency unlocker, but it somehow detached from the man who was steering the boat when it tipped over.
Someone guarded these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a Decent Hunt for Health and Happiness
It’s exciting to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games and recently smartphones.
It is so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, refer to the massive fascination that Pokémon Go is, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990s (which subsequently spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards and other branches).
Like many other pop-cultural phenomena, all of this lost its former relevance a little earlier than this new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be ‘photographed’ (through a screenshot on your phone) or ‘caught’.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the raging fascination by breaking away from the sofas to search for.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by an "ordinary" person every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people it tracked, who performed 30-minute exercises daily, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn’t know who’s playing Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on passing levels.
Many health campaigns persuading people to “find 30 minutes,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” have not found a response because most health messages are boring and spoken by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and an even longer list of benefits, too long to lead here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, the three foundations of health are covered: movement, fresh air, and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boredoms who are looking for something to complain about.
And, yes, someone might run into the door.
So what?
The breakthrough happened.
After all, even though smartphone apps like Fitbit could have tracked our physical activity before, they didn’t give us a reason to practice like this game does.
The novelty will arrive, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, more games will appear that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold of absolute primacy in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fuss.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
dynamic in the jumping position.
Unforced on a log.
Stunning on the floor.
Awesome everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion in the absolute championship on Thursday, placing the gap between themselves and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62,198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medalist and teammate "Final Five" Eli Reisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Beales from the United States performs on the gymnastic beam during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Beales became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the absolute championship title and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she showed her final overall score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as extremely rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Beales has spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 World Cup medals — including 10 gold medals — with such stunning programs in their blend of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I’ve ever seen.”
One final test awaited in Brazil, a competition not so much between the Beales and the others in this field, but between it and the load of high expectations.
Anything less than going back to his family’s home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be seen as an unwarranted expectation.
Simone Biles from the United States, on the left, and Elie Reisman hug after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual absolute gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Beales earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Karoli.
While Beales insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, that’s not exactly the case.
Part of her free exercise program — the one that includes her signature pass — is set to Latin American music that would fit right in the street just outside Rio’s Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, being a beginner walking child and opened by the mother of coach Amy Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn’t lost a single absolute championship since the summer of 2013 — a strip of luck that should last as long as Beales wants.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a small advantage by two rotations, it was a mirage.
A gymnastic log and freestyle exercises – where Beales defends the title of world champion – lie in ambush.
She again stepped forward with 15,433 on the log and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Risman gently hugged her as they waited for the final score—a pure formality—and tears arose around the shiny red with the white and blue eyeliner of Byles when the idea she had once recorded in the scrapbook came true.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina on a tiebreak.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, which the Americans call "grandmother" was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, engulfed in a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Beales, the viral tweet of the 19-year-old from the beginning of this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest assault on Phoenix’s first serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car, talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis, and Ellis' daughter Malia were shot dead on June 12 when their car was parked on a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from a gun, standing on the passenger side of the car, and then fled on another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple homicide appears not to have been the result of the robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2,900 at the disposal of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to check whether it was linked to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas within four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked to each other and were perpetrated by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and daughter Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also published a police report of the shooting, which was aimed at an empty pickup half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and extracted the bullet from the seat and bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old child with microcephaly: "It will get better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund's microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was — I couldn’t do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for this.
That’s not really true — of course you’re signing up for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to place it in a specialized medical institution.
“My first response was, ‘I didn’t think people were still doing that,’” Pixivto said.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund did not sit and crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it slowly goes through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows a gesture that Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just the usual sign language, she says that Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as in Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say how this will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
The pixivto recalls emotional losses due to an uncertain future.
Did I always say what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn’t actually ask for a lifelong forecast because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, floods are the cause of rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have emerged from shores and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and help had already moved to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there were requests for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that it was only the arrival of Tanjipahoa that asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
The risk of flooding remains in place until Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could invade the area.
In southern Alabama, the flood-waiting was in place until Friday as it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Aimee River near Day Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record for flooding levels last weekend.
Weather forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that flooding downstream in Assenshen parish is a threat as these bloated rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tikfo River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling people out of the floods in Amit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife, and his stepson were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says Beaver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said that another stepson, who lives nearby, warned him.
“We woke up and the water kept coming,” Hansford said.
It reached the level of my belt.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest tributary she'd seen in 48 years living here.
Hansford said that he and all members of his family have disabilities, and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is “spreading quickly” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported a 13.75-inch rainfall from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was oversaturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rains and flooding of the streets have led to work to rescue residents from homes in the Tanjipahoa parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities said.
WWL, a branch of CBS, reports that Tanjipahoa’s adviser told about 200 flooded houses.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooding.
The parish’s chairman, Robbie Miller, said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded in the high water.
The shelters were opened in Amit and Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
“They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to recede,” he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available for delivery to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flood we had was in March,” city manager Lacy Landrum said.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Chief of Emergency Services Rupert Lacy reported that heavy rain continued to flow on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before,” Tauson said, “and it’s still pouring down on the ground.”
Mahaj Brown, 6, “Bulled” Remains Alive After Philadelphia Shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
His grandparents say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his arm, leg, arm, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was taken to hospital.
“He got a lot, his little body was riddled with bullets,” says his grandmother Delores Melendez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he was expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims have been reported in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
The shell casings from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different instances of semi-automatic weapons, settled the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting,” police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also affected.
No arrests have been made and police are reportedly viewing CCTV cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was struck in the hand by a crazy bullet Tuesday as she was playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby, and Laurie
This is what I call this year’s Women’s Olympic Gymnastics Team and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, three gymnasts play a key role in this national team: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this national team, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American female presence at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast was an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed her.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simona Biles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And team-mate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like that in gymnastics sections across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Karoli's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastic clubs supported by parents, paying the cost of training, equipment, travel, uniform, fees for participation in competitions, payment for hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where the gymnasts get everything from their training, and it is an expensive and long-term duty for the families of the gymnasts.
Amy Burman, coach of Simona Biles, and Maggie Hani, coach of Lori Hernandez, both have been coaching their female athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and affordable gymnastics education for the communities of countless young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded my gymnasium 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes, located in Harlem, for more than 15,000 urban youngsters (mostly black and Latino) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to debilitating work, discipline and perseverance for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, success at school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and it is wonderful.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Elie, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of "Women's Power" in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of different backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Younger Doctors Take Up Announcement of Further Strikes After Refusal of Jeremy Hunt’s Proposal
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to a revised contract with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the treaty, saying the NHS was on "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would harm staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are reassigned to a new contract that includes shifts in work at night and weekends to improve out-of-hours service.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chairman of the BMA Young Physicians Committee, said in a statement: “The junior doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the existing workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And it's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he does not, then the junior doctors are unequivocal that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The latest strike at the end of April brought about a delay of about 13,000 planned surgeries and 100,000 nurses, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing on a modified contract with the heads of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants better pay for the weekend for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes achieve little or nothing, but put pressure on teams and services already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and frustration to patients, nurses and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken with the Committee of Junior Physicians and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that continuing positive assistance on other important topics – such as staff allocation, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine – were a sign of how serious employers, Health Education and Health Care England were.
The drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are going to take the drug for <0xC2><0xA3>2 a day, after authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The antiretroviral drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of a stroke or a new attack.
The NICE Surveillance Service of the UK National Health Service advised giving it to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
However, now the NICE National Health Service has advised giving it to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
Heart attack occurs to about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque breaks into parts, then this can cause a thrombus that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk, making blood clots less likely.
The draft NICE instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention methods, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke — often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
Pre-recommending ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor – especially the risk of bleeding – is limited after three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
PC ownership culture allows falsification of vote counts to flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was sacked last year because of corruption, giving a boost to the government’s report.
A culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye that has resulted in widespread falsification of vote counts in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles has been criticised by police, election monitors and city officials for ignoring evidence of election violations because of “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that police should be allowed to set boundaries outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters only need to specify their name and address.
The report even suggests applying indelible ink to people’s fingers when they hand over their ballots, in order to rule out that someone could vote twice.
Better protection for whistleblowers is needed, Sir Eric said.
It calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud going hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following the voting scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Luftur Rahman was to be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, “was campaigning on the grounds that it was the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were doubtful or were the result of a persona when a person votes, presenting himself as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your I.D. to prove who you are.
Its report states: “Evidence has been provided of pressure exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, to vote at the will of elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
“There have been fears that ... public institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of ‘political correctness’ to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including suspending political activists from working with mail ballots to vote to stop “harvesting votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tightened checks on registration to prevent the voter list from being used for immigration fraud and privileges.
The option of requiring voters to present an identity card before voting is considered.
Use ink on people’s fingers as soon as they throw their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on people’s nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduce a three-year restriction on applications for automatic mail voting.
Eliminate political campaign participants and activists from working with filled ballots and envelopes with postal voting.
Give the police the authority to set boundaries around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the 1983 People's Act.
It is illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Make it a requirement that only English be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff forces voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric vehemently attacks the city police, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought since the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court considering the election issues has disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of reasonable doubt — the criminal standard of proof — on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the inconclusive “checks for the sake of ticking” of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s ruling at the Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy by the bicycle analogue of Kate and other twins of celebrities of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete isn’t the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who boasts her own famous double — at least, according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to the Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: Brady Allison, a member of the U.S. archer's men's team, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s bike path double, many people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the U.S. archers’ men’s team, Brady Allison, caused the storm on Twitter after images of him appearing frighteningly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street.
In fact, the archer learned about the madness of social media and admitted that he had heard that he had looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge similarity, maybe with the exception of the vegetation on the face,” Brady Huffington Post said.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarity between the British jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact replica of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burg has been compared with the star of the Choir Matthew Morrison for many years.
Going to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a "sports version" of the actor "Start"
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same tanned skin and blond hair as actress AnnaLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, looks like a "sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
Raw Women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, on the right, have the same facial and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Creating a Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to publicize their enthusiasm that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the American football star and actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Lynnie, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to the smile of star Gabriel Union.
A commentator at the Olympics on CBC apologises for saying about the Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”
Byron McDonald’s analysis of the fourth place at the finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan on the women’s freestyle 4x200 m relay outraged on Wednesday CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologise after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “started like a stench” and “died like a pig” while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
One could hear MacDonald, who had been recruited by the CBC commentators to “dilute her with color,” saying, “This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby.”
Too excited, started like a smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, who is 14 years old, swam the second stage of the relay in 1:57.79 – 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the backlog from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC announcer just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’????
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air."
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 m freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Criticism on Twitter immediately fell on Byron McDonald, with many calling for his dismissal
Twitter users didn’t stop when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, tweeted, “Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment about the swim performance being aired."
It was a bad choice of words, and we’re sorry it happened.”
The SIA concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who responded to the statement.
Commentator's friend Scott Russell has apologised on behalf of McDonald's
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald’s comments.
The network also rushed to apologise and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night we acted expeditiously to apologize to our live viewers and our followers on social media.
Let’s be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s speech, not about her as a person.
Still, it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying that he did not think his words would be interpreted as an attack on an individual.
“I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on CBC’s Olympic broadcast.
“I was talking about the swimmer’s performance, not about her in person.”
“It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.”
Primark buyer insulted woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store
Shoppers didn’t know where to look when some woman stripped naked to try on her panties on the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse still, she tried what she looked like in them, pulled them up and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear in a store at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on underwear, the mysterious woman again "dressed and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t try to find somewhere to do it — she was just standing there, shameless.”
“Everyone looked up when she took her panties off again, and she obviously didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same thing with the other three couples before finally deciding that there was nothing she liked, dressed up again and went out.
“It doesn’t seem like she cared who was watching her, or that she thought about the man who would eventually buy those underpants she was trying on.”
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: “How disgusting to think that someone is going to take home the underpants that someone else has already worn and they haven’t been washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: “I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these garments from the sale after she left – and even better.”
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s underwear and find that another woman put on and took them off and they weren’t washed.”
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself from Gun Attacks Using a Cow-Mage
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the Cow-Mage Federation in New York City, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you are approached from the front or from the back, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, according to Mizrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you can see the attacker and ‘release the line of fire’.
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with a free elbow.
Then follows the knee to the groin, and while the attacker bends from the pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a barrel and walk back, holding the gun against him.
For the armed, suitable front, the method of execution is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight on the gun and hit the attacker with your fist in the chest, then turn the gun out of his grip, before stepping back and aiming at him.
Sounds complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery — unless you’re a master cow-mage — is to give your cash away.

The British traveler put his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The host and author of travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent his language on the euro banknote, the railings of the Piccadilly Circus, the toilet flush button on the train and the Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which is supposed to be a film called "The Traveler-Lizun's Guide to the Internal Force", gave some amazing results.
The idea of licking the flush button on a train that thousands of others use can be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about the increase in gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at train stations to the toilet flush button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, “From childhood I was completely carefree about my health and I pulled a lot of different things in my mouth out of the ground, eating worms and dirty water.”
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison: just washed hands should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after the value of his luminometer was more than 4,000 units, while the newly washed hands show less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have shot a film about a traveler called "The Traveler-Lizun's Guide to the Inner Force", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the toilet.
In the film, he said, “It’s close to one of the worst things I’ve ever sniffed in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Traveler-Lizun Guide to Internal Power was taken off with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acid-milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They argue that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with the help of this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, such as the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."
Naturally, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite tough.
I’m glad that some of these licks we managed to film.”
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 percent of respondents associated acid-milk bacteria solely with good stomach and gut health, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally consumed foods containing added acid-milk bacteria.
A hooligan family destroyed Saltash, Cornwall's municipal house, on the eve of eviction.
A hooligan family left their <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 municipal home after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found the property in a state requiring repairs.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the shelves were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McAvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he could not be saved.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for the people here, and I don’t think people should live like that.
There are many things to weigh because this property will probably be known as a not very good aspect of Cornwall.
This family enjoys bad fame, and their name enjoys bad fame.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and police reported that the kingdom of horror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, quarrels and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which can be demolished, found old garbage
The floorboards in the house where drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner from the house this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks for voluntary departure.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One said, “No one cared.”
We’ve lived with them for 20 years, and it’s always been bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of Cornwall Housing’s neighborhood security group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and also regularly called the police
Garbage and old toys were scattered below the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant has not been able to accept any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was marginal, and their actions must have been horrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and the Devon and Cornwall community have put in to give us information.
I hope that this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all a little over 20.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Residential workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as scales, related accessories and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possessing Class B drugs for the purpose of delivery.
She said the money went to pay for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is information that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti all over the surface.
The police say they will try to evict tenants who do not comply with the rules of renting the premises
Angela Crowe, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecution’s accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be allowed by the Devon and Cornwall police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military aircraft almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up the sun, terribly scared for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was conducting a training flight, but insisted there was no risk to safety.
This is the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane peeked over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a touch distance from hunters on a strip of sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
Vacationers jumped on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft’s engines, but not being able to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several holidaymakers who posted a video of the shocking flyby on social media, said: "It flew quite low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed that it would break."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear it felt like the plane was about to crash on me."
Tourists at Aveiro Beach were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said on Monday that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was conducting a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low that it was the only way to check them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than usual due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted no one was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have damaged Portugal’s mainland and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force issued a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances — thick fog and smog from forest fires that made visibility worse.
The plane was performing a training flight, and the pilot was instructed to detect fishing boats as part of the mission
The HASSP system has been mandatory for general catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
The inspections are becoming more active, and the business faces fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - have been mandatory for food producers and carriers, as well as catering companies in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
Rospotrebnadzor’s business checks for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But so far, officials are issuing fines only for individual violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulations in general will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP, as a system that takes risks into account when working with food and prevents them, was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Currently, the system is used at all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, the HACCP has been operating on the territory of the TC.
The business had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the requirement of the HACCP appeared in the technical regulation of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm applies only to food production, and not to restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - the beginning of September.
But they will not cause high demand, as their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts note.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies yesterday sent a letter to the government requesting that charters be allowed now.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, because in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea, most accommodation facilities have already been booked before the end of September,” the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourist products.
As reported in the North-Western regional branch of the Russian Union of tourism industry (RST), if the aviation departments of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
A clear understanding of when charters will be resumed, so far, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the necessary on-boards,” says Pavel Rumyantsev, Deputy Director for Communications and International Projects of the North-Western Regional Department of the PCT.
According to him, the possible renewal of charters is good news, but it will not affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spending holidays in other countries.
In the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously," says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it now gives very budget offers - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposely waiting for very cheap tours," says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, it is not worth counting on the hype - the bulk of travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that, since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the excitement is not worth waiting for.
“For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season", - Valery Rubtsov agrees.
The Tax Code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of compensation payments established by law within the limits of the approved norms related to the compensation of harm caused by injury or other harm to health.
The issuance of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions according to the established norms is provided for in Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of extradition are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of February 16, 2009 No 45n.
According to this document, free delivery of milk or other equivalent foodstuffs to workers on days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of paragraph 2 item 3 of Article 217 of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, income in the form of the value of milk issued to employees on the days of actual employment at work with harmful working conditions in accordance with the norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia No.
Moscow "Gazstroybank" remained without a license of the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations with the credit institution Shareholder Commercial Bank "GASSTROYBANK", registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, Gazprombank JSC carried out a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.

According to the data of the report, according to the size of the assets of JSCB "GASSTROYBANK" as of August 1, 2016, it occupied 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS dies in Syria
Kadiz Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died from a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only advantage of all of this – like a gravestone and a will to others, that these are precisely the risks we are talking about when traveling to a war zone – is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice,” he said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow for several months.
Reid Says Clinton Will Remain Loyal to Garland as Candidate for Chief Justice if Elected
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he is convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected as president.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s claim, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call on Thursday that he predicts Clinton will choose Garland "with some degree of confidence".
A spokeswoman for Reed later said he hadn’t spoken directly to Clinton about whether she was going to put Garland forward, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team would not want to “scroll the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland’s nomination are “traps” and “assistants” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was not fit for office.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women as well as men'
Treats magazine has partnered with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli in the 1970s.
But instead of nude celebrities, they set out to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with nude muses.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does, too.
“We need to go back to a demonstration of an eternal and classic nude figure where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a woman’s body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be a part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
Muscovites will be given memoirs about unfair online stores.
In Moscow, they are going to release a memo that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the specialists of the department prepare a memo that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraudulent schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
These will be general information and the legislative framework, rules of delivery of goods, ways to protect their legal rights.
The appendix will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on,” Rospotrebnadzor said.
The memoir is currently being finalized.
Subsequently, it will be posted on the website of Rospotrebnadzor in Moscow, it is also planned to release a printed version and distribute it to Muscovites.
The Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement in which it named the name of the second suspect in the organization of sabotage in the Crimea.
Persons from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Yevgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtei Andrey Romanovich.
"All of them give a confession," the statement said.
Earlier, a resident of the Zaporizhzhya region Evgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in the Crimea, admitted his guilt at the interrogation.
The FAS will fine Google for 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google Corporation in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the website of the agency.
The fine for Google for violation of antimonopoly legislation amounted to 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay a fine in the near future,” said Alexey Dotsenko, deputy head of the FAS.
In the course of the investigation, the FAS found that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the store of Google Play applications only on the condition that the device will be installed and other applications of the corporation.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates part 1 of Article 10 of the Federal Law "On Protection of Competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the regulation will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a beneficial effect on our consumers.
The Law "On Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, and by transnational corporations, including," said Elena Zaeva, Head of the Communications and Information Technology Regulatory Department of the FAS of Russia.
The agency suspects the conspiracy of 16 Russian stores.
The New Book Network has been fined for selling the book “50 Days Before My Suicide.”
The chain of shops "New book" was fined for the sale of the book Stace Kramer "50 days before my suicide", reports the city news agency "Moscow".
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
Ostankino district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a penalty in the form of a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products, arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor administration.
A source in the New Books confirmed that it was a work of Stace Kramer.

Earlier it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown plan to hold a memorial service for the sculptor in New York, presumably by August 14.
The end user of vinyl: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And while you have not rushed to clog the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonym of Non-All-LonelyMenMiddle Years, this statement is derived from factual data.
According to YouGov, so much of the discussed revival of records is due not to the boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate the novelty of the material object, and the nostalgia of the middle years.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those who belong to the 18-24 age group are less likely.
It’s also not just an act of collecting by amateurs – it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog was a TV news story, the camera would follow me as I walk through the center of busy Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and violently gesticulating before stopping, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, “Well, let’s see.”
All right, let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops have now flooded the buildings once occupied by independent sellers – a few music stores with fantastic specialists are still left.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene in which I am close to different people in some of these stores and try to estimate their age and emotional mood through observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55 years old, whom I followed from Sister Ray (counting data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counting data: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and strolling around the shops to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
“I think so,” he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he emailed me a picture, I didn’t chase him to the house), go through the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles comes in part from his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn’t afford when they came out and buy back the items he sold when he was young and broke.
“A lot of what I’m buying is the late ’60s, the early ’70s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things for which I was probably too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are most likely introverts who like their own company, adding, “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink too much.
That's my flaw.
Wes, a 25-year-old who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the profile of YouGov.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people under the influence of the hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy back their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among vinyl revival figures of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the records?
Spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that record stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Wes, some older customers, in particular, are offended by the non-cash payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to retreat into the permanence of familiar album envelopes, objects that awaken memories of serene youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling a void or possessing material things as a kind of pacification,” says Wes.
Since I’m a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it too.
It’s an easy way to get your head in.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month hadn’t listened to it yet.
The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl don’t have a record player.
At this stage of the news reportage, I would probably look seriously puzzled by leafing through the rack with Bosan<0xC3><0xB3>w’s collections.
The "trophy" aspect of rebirth is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (counting data: three middle-aged men) noticed.
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More work, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, they are a little under twenty, who only get acquainted with it.
Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples over 70, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores – the latest synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, breaks through the speakers – it’s nice to see diversity in its customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the painful psychological trauma is difficult to establish after standing for 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, walked on Fopp for a few minutes, reviewing various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends the money.
She does not earn much, she says, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ...” she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh full of love.
I don’t know how to explain it, it’s really unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashionistas.
As I create the illusion that I’m looking at jeans-backed shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is set with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac records: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any medium collection.
No one is looking—perhaps because they are just an ornament, some so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's real art vinyl.
But given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the outback of Soho for a while, there’s almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a stratum of the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the stratum that spends most of its money on luxury items such as vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don’t rule out the huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in school or offices.
But they clearly don’t spend Thursday mornings strolling around the records shops on Berwick Street, flipping through the records and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland’s polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal
Scientists say that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record was set by a female aged 272 to 512 years and five meters long.
French court rejects proposal to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by Calais authorities to demolish dozens of improvised shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, Calais said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 makeshift shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer a haircut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple dishes for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
The prefecture of Calais said that these sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing camp population.
They argued that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
Lille’s court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel people running 72 home-made shops, but said the Calais prefecture’s problems “were fully understood.”
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than simply feeding people who “live in extremely shaky conditions.”
He said the spaces provided calm meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Café at Camp, which operates not for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children’s cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are no older than eight years old."
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L’Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number at Camp Jungle had risen to more than 9,000 — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The libraries of the microdistricts invite young freemen to educational programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Trainer.
The programs are aimed at the children’s audience, so most of them will take place in a game form.
Today, August 10, Library-Branch No. 2, in the saline microdistrict, invites to the cruise presentation "My town is small".
On August 11 in the library-filial No. 1 will be held the local history lesson "I live in this city, I know this city".
In the library-filial No. 2 on the same day will be held a multimedia lesson "Land of the Past Fate".
And in the library-filial No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for the children from the northern microdistrict, the library-filial No. 3 will hold a game program "Physical-Hello!".
Britain stops on silver in rugby 7 after Fiji master class allows them to take gold
Britain’s impressive series in Rugby-7 was crushingly stopped at the final hurdle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night when they were completely defeated by 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on ball possession, pitching, evasion, support for the game, running the lines and brute force to win gold – their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor a consolation in the form of silver – Britain’s third in a day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Olympic tournament on Rugby-7, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The painful beating of the Box, 7–5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could have come back to negatively affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji in this form won the best team of 15 people.
It may be some consolation for the UK — but probably not — that at least one British man will hang a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, a former Wimbledon England chief.
It was a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji began great, for fun, repulsing the attempts of the UK to intercept the ball.
It was like bumping into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when Osea Colinisau dived into the corner.
Having four minutes on the clock, Gerrier Tuvay added another touchdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A magnificent attempt to intercept Mitchell kept Mount Leon Nakarawa from scoring a third, but this only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute Jasa Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after the resumption and the clock was still more than a minute ... in the first half.
Watemo Ravovo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to a 29-0 in a break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby 7, while the UK is still mastering the craft.
Which, to a large extent, is.
Britain made massive half-game replacements, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK by making a touchdown in the left corner to score 36-7, but the game had long gone the way of the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the joyful approach of Fiji.
Mata William decorated the Fijian cake, which did not need to be decorated, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier that day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and the UK slightly circumvented South Africa in the tense semi-final of one attempt each – the difference is the British realization.
Kyle Brown brings Boxing forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant final attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother of England's 15th team, Anthony, secured a victory—and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing fight against cancer coach
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and that says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy climbs in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the paddles, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always as long as they were aiming for the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sports to reach that height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes, gliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing is a battalion of ready-made hands contributing to gradually increasing victories, which are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see that day.
As he said, it was a dangerous business.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don’t, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment early in 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum if this could be the correct expression in circumstances like these.
I needed to pay, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walking around the ward — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they spoke was enough a few steps.
Here's how it starts.
Rowing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, captain of an artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: “I was an emotional wreck this week, maybe it’s a little too much, but it means so much.”
It only confirms how much it means to me, how much me and Helen worked, and Robin did too.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
“Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you very much, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for a better partner for training or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very much in phase.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do something amazing.
We weren’t waiting for fireworks today, we were just waiting for us to be able to row well and get out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, on her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I had become an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food products prohibited for import into Russia.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was imposed in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban was repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, the ban included meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products.
Disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sales.
Hunting for the "forbidden"
Rain and thunderstorms are expected in Moscow on Friday.
Through the metropolitan region will pass the atmospheric front, which will bring precipitation and lower air temperature.
During the day, the air warms up to 25 degrees of heat.
So, on the night of Saturday in Moscow in some places will pass short-term rain, possible thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m / s.
In the afternoon, rain is expected with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m / s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also predicted in the Orel, Kursk and Voronezh regions, according to Dni.ru.
Rainfall is unlikely in the next working week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil contradicted the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against Russia," the organization said in a statement on its official website.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures were “systematic” or “comprehensive”.
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of economic development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia’s actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that U.S. behavior in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of discussion accepted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members due to the Americans’ refusal to approve for a second term the South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not apply to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently comprises 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the administration of the President changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed former deputy Sergei Ivanov Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers important anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Previously, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of the head of the administration transparent and understandable and permutation will not fundamentally change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head, who has been working in the presidential administration for quite a long time, effectively built the activities of the AP.
In his place came the deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino - a man who knows the specifics of this work.
In Poland, it is allowed that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive to it due to the reorientation on fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the vice-president of the Polish company in finance Bohuslav Majec.
His words were conveyed by Tass.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all [from Gazprom], we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway,” said Majetz.
Currently, Gazprom has a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 supplied it with almost 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in PGNIG’s purchases increased to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish Antimonopoly Office did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the Deputy Chairman of the Management Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Nord stream-2" will be held in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
In late May, it was reported that Gazprom has not yet planned to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to abandon long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Alexander Medvedev, the company’s deputy chairman of the board.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased gas purchases from the Russian Federation by 42%.
Deputy Chairman of Gazprom added that the mere fact of filing a Polish PGNIG application to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to achieve a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
The commissioner of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimsky said that the Polish authorities have decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government’s commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two strands of a sea gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany at the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near Ukraine’s border with Crimea.
This was reported by the first Deputy Head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area," he said, responding to a corresponding question from journalists, RIA Novosti reported.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers tracked what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of the Yak-42 passenger plane landing at Ufa airport, which rolled out of the runway for 400 meters and crashed on the left wing, appeared on the Internet.
The video was published by the TV channel "360".
The incident occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no one was injured.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa airport operates in the usual mode.
The Volga Investigative Directorate on the transport of the TFR was engaged in finding out the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The United Nations is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but UN special envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura believes the fact of the incident is undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack with the use of toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where the Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with poisonous substances, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group “Harakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki” of the incident.
Soon it became known that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I smelled gas, my eyes started burning, it became difficult to breathe,” an eyewitness said.
As a result of the attack at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is enshrined in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shelling of its areas is carried out on a daily basis, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects from Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in hostilities.
The current regime of daily three-hour calm in the organization is considered "not enough to help almost 2 million civilians trapped".
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egeland, said a 48-hour cease-fire would be needed to deliver aid to and evacuate the sick and wounded every week.
“We have to send bulky cargo from a convoy of trucks to areas where roads are almost destroyed and those that remain are mined,” Egelann said.
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened humanitarian windows in Aleppo.
In the face of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Syria’s second-largest city, Russia announced on August 11 the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities regime, which will operate daily starting Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essentials to the city.
The decision of the Russian Defense Ministry was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to stop the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
Four people were killed in a series of explosions in resorts in Thailand.
Several explosions erupted in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country’s Interior Ministry has hastened to say that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and characteristics of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military leaders of the country.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
Since the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth has fallen from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism has remained one of the few industries to show development.
In 2016, the country has already visited 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about the goals, he added, but the interior ministry said the countries "are confident that they are not associated with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions," said Mr. Patanacharoen.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are actually local sabotage, and we are trying to establish the identities of those behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of the Queen of Thailand Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely to be directed against it.
According to Police General Sithichei Srisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside the trees on busy streets filled with restaurant-dinner tourists.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are not yet known, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the explosions to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission for the drafting of the constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and played a significant role in the election of the country’s prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the parliamentary elections of 2017.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the country’s army commander Prayut Chan-Ocha.
To this step, he said, the army was driven by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Peace and Order Council, imposed curfews and censorship, dispersed protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok was in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Chinawat, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the surrounding provinces in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, at the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests took place, there were two explosions, injuring 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions produced unknowns on motorcycles.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and have drawn military forces to protect protesters.
In the dry log began to develop conditions.
As it became known, the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold mine Sukhoi Log with the preservation of two key restrictions.
The auction is proposed not to allow companies where 25% or more belong to foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of the state share.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players do not risk taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August and held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government the draft order and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold ore deposit in Russia Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), said two sources familiar with the situation.
The project was submitted on Wednesday evening, one of them said.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project was submitted to the government.
The representative of the supervising subsoil use of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin told "Kommersant" that the official's office has not yet received the project.
“The auction can be announced as early as August, immediately after the release of the government order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender can be held as early as October,” the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to "Kommersant", the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, spelled out in the version that was sent for approval to ministries and FIOVs in July (there is "Kommersant").
The first is the presence in the capital of applicants of at least 25% of the state participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 about foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as already written by “Kommersant” on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since Sukhoi Log belongs to the subsoil of federal importance (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies”, but refused to comment on the details before the government’s order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, they said in December 2015 "Kommersant" in the Ministry of Natural Resources and later confirmed by the Governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with Rostex".
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, interlocutors of the "Kommersant" do not specify.
"But this is in the spirit of time: not to give control in the largest gold field in Russia against the background of Western sanctions," the interlocutor of the "Kommersant", familiar with the preparation of the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy said that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants attract them “as a financial structure, technology partners.”
The interlocutors of the "Kommersant" consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukhoi Log in the industry is considered to be a consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation, PJSC Polus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
According to "Kommersant", in July, the partners created joint venture "SL Gold", where "Polus" 51% share, the structure of "Rostekh" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, Polus said it was “certainly interested in this asset” and had all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the statement added.
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is up to the government of the Russian Federation, the sources of “Kommersant” said.
Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, developing assets in Chukotka, said about the possibility of participation in the development of Dry Log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "<0xD0><0xAA>", are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold-industrialists of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated the investment in Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants scare away not only the volume of investments, but also the complexity of the project: a serious reconnaissance of stocks and technologies for working with complex ores is needed, interlocutors of "Kommersant" in the industry explain.
In the pension market, the largest M&A transaction has started - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" has launched the process of combining four NPFs controlled.
As a result, on the basis of "Gas Fund Pension savings" will be created NPF with the volume of savings of about 373 billion rubles.
About the launch of the procedure of combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagro Fund", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension Savings" - yesterday the owner of 100% of funds of "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" LLC said.
"Reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-deterioration of the terms of the current contracts," the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of "Gas Fund Pension savings".
As noted by the general director of this NPF Oleg Byaloshitsky, the pooling of funds allows you to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the indicative period of completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, Gazprom Pension Savings will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the amount of pension savings of the joint funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the merger itself the group launched much later competitors.
So, controlled by the group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems," - said the General Director of NPF "Future" Nikolay Sidorov.
Active work on the consolidation of funds from April is also underway in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfond" should join the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017 NPF "Trust" will join them.
“The pooling of funds will give the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses,” the Safmar pension group said.
The pause in the pooling of funds endured by the “KIT Finance Pension Administrator” can be caused by several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NPFs were unable to redeem more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds in which the group was actively housed.
After the amendments to the resolution of the Central Bank in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, there are no more such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one major player," - says Yuri Nogin, director of the group of ratings of financial institutions of ACRA.
Several top-15 NPF asset managers have called the division of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, the appointments in a single fund, which should have been agreed by the group’s owners, another possible reason for the pause.
Yesterday Anatoly Gavrilenko was not available for comments.
The request of the "Kommersant" in the NPF "Gazfond" was also not answered.
Although the consolidation of funds is a time-consuming and costly event, at a long distance this decision will be justified.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension partner" Sergey Okolesnov notes, Gazprom Pension Savings has fewer outflows, the accession will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofund" in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software will be required.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, Managing Director for Corporate Ratings at Expert RA.
"The effect of the reduction of duplicate functions will unequivocally cover the possible costs of the association," Mr. Mitrofanov said.
The cost of combining the four funds Sergey Okolessev estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles per year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget will actually be halved," Mr. Okolesnov said.
In the Russian rental came the best Disney movie "Pete and his dragon".
The beautiful views of New Zealand, the charming dragon, the soulful story and the country-style songs are enough to believe in old-fashioned magic again, believes Elena Kravtsun.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle nanny, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in his arms.
Six years later, he is grown up and in a loincloth, no longer distinguishable from another clever forest ruffian - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete is discovered by red-haired Jager Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively rains down the forest.
Now she will not only have to believe in the existence of the dragon, but also help to save him.
Pete goes on an accelerated course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts and smile more dazzlingly than in any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too horribly to be hated or feared by the viewer.
Even Gavin, who discovered the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
The huge fluffy dragon also turned out not to be scary, with a good bulldog face, airline wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon snarls funny, mumbles, even snarls and, fortunately, does not speak, but he wants to stroke all the time, so it is advantageously different from all known cinematic dragons.
Elliott’s visual image and manner of holding on provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only small spectators, but also adults, begin to cry desperately in the three streams.
Remarkably good and young Oaks Figli in the role of Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuously betrays a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to shoot a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film "Dragon Pete" from 1977, mediocre from nose to tail end and remembered only as a mix of animation and game cinema, and make it the most soulful film this summer?
It's not like a miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: an orphan Pete and a dragon.
There were musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
This fairy tale reads features borrowed from "Bambi", "Alien" and many other heart-loving children's paintings.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, Pete and the Dragon is not as stunningly beautiful as the same Jungle Book, and there is no skilled villain like Kate Blanchett in the role of stepmother in the new Cinderella.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, director Lowry will receive the keys to Disney's magical castle once again - for an artistic adaptation of the Peter Pan story.
Worked in "Pete and his Dragon" tandem, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks entered into a new ambitious project about an unadulterated boy based on the fairy tale of the same name by James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will face a new charge
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found shortcomings in the case of their defendant.
The fact that the prosecutor’s office made such a presentation, we learned from investigators just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting did not take place in the end, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office," said lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said that the prosecutor’s office pointed out to the investigators the discrepancy between the qualifications of the case and the materials collected.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence.
As reported by "Kommersant", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation removed from the indictment of the journalist RBC the wording about "destabilizing the political situation in the direction of instability" and "the overthrow of power in an illegal way".
ALEXANDER ZILBERT, a correspondent for Kommersantboscosport, lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the Russian national team’s home, had lunch at a local canteen and even passed the WADA test.
I don't think life's gonna stop here for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts are sometimes completed at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, the settlement and eviction from the village is carried out without stopping, as some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only arrive here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all Olympic delegations reach one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our, consider, is exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it there are some shortcomings.
The hot water problem, the toilets, I'm sorry.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners began to come, but only rush some substance on the floor, and all.
They have, you see, some innovative flooring.
You can’t wash them humanly.
We know these floors are ordinary laminate flooring!
In general, we have achieved a change of the cleaning company and now with this everything is OK.
The Olympic village is such a Yuzhnoye Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - an impressive moat, in some places flooded with water.
Well, for reliability, there is still a two-meter iron fence around the perimeter, along which the automatics walk.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our national team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine what problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two announcements at the reception desk: the printed "Please do not throw paper into the toilet!" and the hand "I will accept as a gift badges.
The stand itself is drowned in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the titles of the brochures: "Memories of infectious diseases for those traveling to Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, getting a foreign body into the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - the stages of cardiovascular resuscitation", "First aid for burns, heat".
The text inside is hopeful.
For example: "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone expects a favorable outcome.
Of course, in the location of the national team of Russia there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide residents of the house with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
In front of the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster: "Despite everything, we will win!".
And, of course, the poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who are fearful believe in them.
Let the less of us, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater upliftment of spirit there is an announcement: “Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order moleben and other requirements by phone...
In general, the village has a center of meditation and religious rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to use during the fire.
And in the darkness he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I suppose, in readiness at any moment to rush to wash innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on the cold stairs.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time acquaintance - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampoline players, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - shares the impressions of the well-deserved coach of Russia. - We live by two, beds, of course, are almost always standing, but this is uncritical.
The bathroom is one in four, but spacious.
The cabinet, of course, funny, made of fabric, does not inspire confidence, but things can be put.
"No, you're pretending, they've run out of tea!" says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it is an area of 2,700 square meters and is ready to receive 5,000 visitors at the same time.
There are 60,000 servings per day for free.
The menu options are "Best of Brazil", "Cuisines of the World", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The latter option, as I peeked, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, let's say, I did not find soups in any of the divisions of the giant restaurant.
What kind of soup? - Kuznetsova wonders. - No tea!
I'm glad I brought the Chinese with me, the custard.
And a kettle.
But just so you know, we've got even worse food on the court.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a plate with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as an indication of the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, it was edible, I must admit.
I don’t even understand why such a queue is always in the local McDonald’s.
Our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) - are waiting for full, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant.
Seduce skillfully - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoking, you might say.
To get a gift, you need to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
There are questions in Russian! - attacked me a girl from WADA.
But that's not what I was attacking.
I was in a patriotic mood, of course.
The situation escalated on the second question: “If I received a notification about the passage of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?”
I stopped at option B: “No, I have one hour.”
I lost my vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that there is no need to expect a weakening from WADA.
Anyway, we need to be here right away.
Well, in the seventh stage of the quiz, my situation became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if I found it difficult to follow a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I’m having a hard time, by the way!), then I could use dietary supplements to get “additional nutrients to boost my performance.”
No, no, no, no, no, no.
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is not categorically forbidden, but strongly discouraged in several sentences.
It's not fair to WADA!
How's it going, Russia? - the host of the quiz mockingly asks.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and our whole deblooded team.
So I focused and out of my last strength I won an unhappy T-shirt.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I found myself in a fitness center next door.
I'm interested in counting the trainers.
It's down to 250.
He noted with surprise that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of treadmills.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let the one who can't play train!
But in a nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line with the ophthalmologist.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, where there is no spitting, there is a device for issuing condoms.
It has an inspiring message: “Feast with a condom!”
All that remains is to twist the iron that resembles the handle of the door lock, and a condom made of natural Amazonian latex is ready to fall out of the apparatus.
I took one to remember.
Athletes will not lose - they brought them 450 thousand.
Just for festive and leisure time in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Next to it, just in case, there is an educational plaque, reminding that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices like video simulators.
What is it? - I am interested in a comrade in the form of the Ukrainian team, who actively uses a strange toy.
I could, of course, just say that I do not want to talk to a person in the form of the national team of Russia, and everything.
Here, by the way, on some strange confluence of circumstances in the eyes of the guys in yellow and blue.
The most played team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking at every corner of it, it takes at least three hours.
But, if it is to walk, and not to ride electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with a moose at the entrance and a tent with a restorative bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaning, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and mail with unique stamps (only you can not
And late in the evening you, decapitated, will sit beside the olive tree, hung with multi-colored ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that sprays liquids to kill insects, thinking of the eternal.
About the Olympic Movement.
Which in this village doesn't stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world held its breath and watched as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went into the network.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I got first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite who saw it happen – except for those who watched the Carioca competition that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
Imagine: a deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from below, as always, wake up by one o’clock in the morning and start yelling at each other.
And threatening to move furniture.
In the kitchen there is a tap - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as the plumber asked, a new one.
Nothing is clear in the TV schedule, so he simply controlled the channels "Match", "First" and just in case "Russia" - although this is almost meaningless.
"Russia" - the homeland of repetitions, the whole sport there for some reason in the record.
The series is broadcast live.
Hope, of course, on the "Match" - all evening the young man shouted in the news first about the great semi-final of Deriglazov--Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is USA-Australia.
I have nothing bad to say about this decision.
The Australians were equal, the first half won in general.
They put Americans in the shoes of their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but as they say now, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with Di Francesca is approaching, and the screen is unchanged.
In a mild panic, I begin to scroll through the channels.
It feels like the second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep into the cables.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "Matches".
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
The text and tweets of some sports sites do not suit me.
Convulsive surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of the "First", it turns out, there is a direct technical broadcast of all the competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on the fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova perfectly counterattacks, goes forward on points - and quite obviously begins to drag time.
The Italian plays off almost the entire draw.
Ours is one point ahead, just over two seconds to the end.
Di Francesca rushes to Deriglazova, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian injects.
Victory! Victory!
A couple of seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
I was the first to see it with my own eyes.
The crazy, the faithful, the involved.
The Spiritual Directorate of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the Dum obligated its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatar, in order to force the young Tatars to “learn their native language”.
The administration said that this “in no way violates” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
Some mosques in Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience".
Yesterday, the plenum of the Tatarstan State Duma unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
According to the Mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language".
“For those who say it is ‘heavy,’ in every major mosque, we intend to organize Tatar language lessons absolutely free of charge,” Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "should already be in the Tatar language".
He recalled that the State Duma of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, "can thoroughly prepare for them."
DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the Republic.
According to the Mufti, in the districts Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnay Mosque, Zakabanna and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task for all students to speak both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any violation of the Muslim-netar," said Mr. Mukhametshin, explaining that the sermon itself "is not mandatory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, and lectures and lessons in Russian will be held in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin said that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
Besides Russian and Tatar, other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of DUM was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the executive committee of the VKT Rinat Zakirov said to “Kommersant”: “Mosques are an important part of our national life.”
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the WCT "see it as correct".
The imams interviewed by the “Kommersant” who preached in Russian are ready to implement the decision of the Duma, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
Both the Tatars and the Russians go to the mosque.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they will be sluggish.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnayev mosque Farkhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, the sermons in the Russian language are closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere from the beginning."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show a way out of this situation," he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
A lot of foreign students come to us: Africans, Arabs.
"Therefore, we have been four years since we switched to Russian," says Imam.
He believes that in the Tatar language, the sermons will “get to a narrower circle and will not reach the whole audience”.
But we will abide by the plenum's decision.
The result of the preaching will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will only be easier because Tatar is my native language," Gabdullah Galiullin concluded.
Former FSIN Director Sentenced to Court
The Prosecutor’s Office of Moscow has approved the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the GSU of the SCR on the embezzlement of budget funds allocated for the needs of the FSIN of Russia.
Former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy will appear before the court, causing damage to the FSIN in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The Metropolitan Prosecutor’s Office sent to the Zamoskvoretsky District Court a criminal case against Alexander Reimer, the former director of the Federal Penitentiary Service of Russia, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolapov, as well as the director of FSUE “Center for Information and Technical Support and Communications of the Federal Service for the Execution of Penalties” (FSUE CITOS) Viktor Definov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the SCU of the SCC in Moscow under Part 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (abuse of official powers, which entailed serious consequences), Part 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using its official position, as part of an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is accused under part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury budget funds allocated to the FSIN to provide the department with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
For the theft of budget money, the group members developed a scheme according to which the enterprise under their control, FSUE CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical means of control and supervision, including “electronic bracelets”, and sold at prices inflated several times.
Despite the fact that FSUE CITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a completed production cycle of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts worth more than 3.3 billion rubles were concluded between it and the FSIN of Russia.
As a result of this scheme, the accounts of the Samara branch of FSUE were more than 2 billion rubles, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cash cash received personally Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, a criminal case in respect of which is allocated to a separate proceeding.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found of unknown origin cartridges to the award pistol, which allowed him to bring additional charges.
In this case, the volume of which amounted to 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim against the accused for compensation of material damages in the amount of 2.7 billion rubles.
Footballer Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of the former footballer and then Member of Parliament Hakan Shukur and conducted searches in two houses of his family.
The star of Turkish football in the 1990s and early 2000s, striker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with an attempted coup last month.
Forward, who ended his sports career in 2008, is accused of belonging to an “armed terrorist group.”
We are talking about the Hizmet movement, a society associated with the famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gülen.
It is his President Erdogan who considers the organizer of the attempted military coup that took place on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen lives in the United States, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, a warrant for the arrest of Hakan Shukur was issued today, police have already searched two houses that belong to the family of the former footballer.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gulen’s organization, in addition to Hakan Shukur himself, included his father.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Shukur defended the colors of several Turkish clubs and played for the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
He hasn’t spent more than one season in any of them.
Hakan Shukur remains Turkey's most successful striker to date, with 112 matches for the national team and 51 goals scored.
In 2013, Hakan Shukur left his post because of the corruption investigation around Erdogan’s party and his immediate entourage.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of facilitating a military coup and links with the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, media workers may face lengthy prison sentences ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than for films of foreign production,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which screens reach an average of 20-25 tapes.
"Even they find it very difficult to compete with the Transformers and Iron Man, which have huge budgets," he said.
We will remind, on July 1 in the Crimea began the work of the All-Russian youth educational forum "Tavrida".
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miassa (Chelyabinsk region) detained the lawyer of the former Vice-Governor Nikolay Sandakov Konstantin Akulich.
As reported by "Yuzhny Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulich today was summoned to the investigative department of the Miassa SCR to bring charges in the case of a year ago about beatings.
At that time, Konstantin Akuli<0xC4><0x87> went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially, it was initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolay Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulichev," - says Sergey Kolosovsky.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that the RMK took up the modernization of one of the oldest and environmentally “dirty” enterprises of the country – the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
The Karabakh copper smelting plant was founded by an English joint-stock company led by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the vital activity of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already infamously known as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company was transferred to the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region Boris Dubrovsky, who visited in the first days of July "Karabakhmed".
The head of the South Urals called the grandiose changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed transferred to the RMK group.
The main modernization event of Karabashmedi in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" is the reconstruction of the converter division.
The replacement of three converters, pollinators, gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes deducted into the budget of the city of Karabakh will increase.
For the entire period of implementation of the project of the Tominsky GOK - from the beginning of construction to the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOK, the income of taxes in the budgets of all levels can amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the company works successfully, the amount of deductions can be more," added Valery Ulanovsky.
The RMK clarified that in 2015 tax deductions from the Mikheevsky GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, to build cultural and entertainment facilities, to decorate territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was a major overhaul, and in fact - almost complete reconstruction of the kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of emergency.
Also on the territory of the RMK Arena there will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.

The pensioner turned the staircase into a “budget beach tower”.
Users of the network laughed at the photos, in which an elderly man installed a ladder on the beach and turned it into a springboard for jumping into water.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the group "My Taganrog" in the social network "VKontakte", which many decided that the photo was taken on the shore of the Sea of Azov.
In the comments, “innovation” was dubbed “budget tower” and “mobile springboard”.
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "sweetie", and some drew attention to the fact that the man seriously risks being injured when jumping from his tower, as he installed it at insufficient depth.
However, one of the commentators on the portal Pikabu noted that it is impossible to judge the depth of the sea by the picture.
"Firstly, we do not know what depth there is, the beach can be bulky with a sharp descent of a meter just behind the stairs, and secondly, even if there is a meter of depth, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters," wrote the user under the nickname C0JIBAMDJZ.

Authorities in the French city of Cannes have banned visiting local beaches in a burkini, a special swimsuit for women that completely covers the body from the head to the ankles.

The Blagoveschensky city court (Amur region) sentenced the former head of the city Alexander Migulya to nine years of a colony of the general regime.
This was reported on Friday, August 12, on the website of the court.
Migulu was found guilty of committing crimes under articles 286 (exceeding powers), 285.1 (non-purpose spending of budget funds) and 285 (abuse of official powers) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation established that the official in December 2008 provided his acquaintance with a land plot in the village of Muhinka in violation of the procedure established by the land legislation.
In 2006, he illegally issued a decree on the acquisition of ownership of the city of a road bridge across the river Chigiri, at an inflated price without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, Interfax said.
In addition, in the period from 2007 to 2010, Migulya, in the interests of a commercial organization controlled by him, changed the terms of payments under the contract of sale of the lease of a land plot, which was provided for the construction of housing, and also exempted the company from rent.
As a result, the budget of the region has not received more than 5 million rubles, and the city treasury is about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who was in detention on suspicion of corruption, and who claimed a deputy mandate, did not provide signature lists for participation in the elections to the State Duma on time and was removed from the election race.
Migula was detained in May 2015 on the territory of the Lipetsk region and placed in a detention center.

Owners of messengers and mail services should identify users and remove prohibited information - this is the summary of the draft law developed by the Media Communications Union (MCS), which brings together the largest Russian telecom operators (there are Vedomosti).
Employees of the three member companies of the Union confirmed that such a project is under discussion.

WSJ: The United States is considering imposing sanctions against Russia because of the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
U.S. officials are considering imposing new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama will have to officially blame the attack on the servers of Russia or Russian-backed hackers.
According to the sources, the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost sure of Russia’s involvement in the cyber attack.
WSJ notes that usually the US prefers not to name those who carry out hacking attacks.
The exception is made in 2014 hacking of the database of the company Sony Entertainment Pictures, the responsibility for which was officially entrusted to the DPRK.
However, last year, Obama issued a decree simplifying the procedure for imposing sanctions against those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but it can also be used against other countries.
The decision-making process on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication writes.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers acted with Russian support, they will have to weigh the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the national committee of the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks has published an email from the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hacking.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was a violation of competition in the mobile application market.
Antimonopoly proceedings were initiated at the initiative of Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gives smartphone makers access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular, from Yandex.
The FAS found confirmation of these claims and established that the company abused its dominant position in the market and imposed on manufacturers of mobile devices the installation of other applications together with the Google Play store.
As a result of the inspection, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, Deputy Head of the FAS Alexey Dotsenko said.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the decree.
The FAS concluded that the law on protection of competition must be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
In turn, Google intends to study the solution first and only then will be determined with further actions: to perform it or to challenge it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized the company as a violation of the competition law in September last year and ordered to adjust the contracts until December 18.
However, Google did not agree to this.
Since then, the company and the agency have been conducting legal proceedings.
The FAS noted that, despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will not lead to anything.
This opinion was expressed by the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect either the users or the competitiveness of the corporation.

Snapchat's "Anime" Effect Criticized as a Cartoon on Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by the anime, but some reviewers say it is racially tactless.
Using the “Linses” tool, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character to trick a picture of Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are coarse, curved tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become well known.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark facial skin or encouraging bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth, and puffy cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians — “yellow-faced.”
And they wondered if these repetitive contradictions pointed to the company’s more serious problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, there were reports and subsequent indignation in the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat said it had removed the feature.
The lens was intended as a tribute to the characters of the anime, not as a cartoon on Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminded insulting stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least awkward.”
She added: “It’s hard to argue with side-by-side comparisons of very rough cartoons on Asians and filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but highly despicable yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And a huge audience of young people at Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older generation — could mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday, “this course of events is much harder to go unnoticed than it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity in recruiting in Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly male-only white management and ended her article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
Zhu, who herself is an American of Chinese origin, wrote: "Either they didn't have enough non-white people in the state to make such decisions, or they have non-white people working, but they don't hold positions that can be spoken out safely and openly."
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with Snapchat’s failure to answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to involve domestic resources.
Zhu, for her part, said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say it won’t work.”
Military leadership misrepresented intelligence on ISIS, the congressional commission reports
U.S. Central Command officials have altered intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what happened on the ground, the congressional commission said in a report released on Thursday.
An interim report by the task force set up by Republican chairmen of the House Armed Services Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found “widespread discontent” among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that leaders backed their assessments of U.S. actions aimed at defeating ISIS.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the top Centcom command generally gave a more optimistic picture of US counter-terrorism activities than evidenced by real-world data and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
“What was happening in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with an unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said Rep. Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
Problems with management in Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report examines in detail the shortcomings that have consistently emerged in 2014 and 2015 in describing and analysing U.S. actions aimed at training Iraqi forces provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration’s leadership ordered the falsification of reports, it claims that analysts felt that the Central Committee’s leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many of the Central Command’s press releases, statements, and testimony in Congress were significantly more optimistic than actual events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at Mosul’s return could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
“After months of investigation, this is known for sure,” House Representative Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the U.S. Central Command’s intelligence service faked the command’s intelligence documents to downplay the ISIS threat in Iraq.
The Republicans formed an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation progresses, more detailed data will follow, according to a report released on Thursday.
An additional, unfinished investigation of the Central Committee intelligence is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the House Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly closed procedure for the production of intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, a senior Democrat on the committee.
The procedure, Schiff said, “has stalled the issuance of intelligence documents,” damaged analysts’ morale, and “does not sufficiently reflect divergent views.”
But Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to tailor their findings to “a given or a political interpretation.”
The preliminary results of the congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the chief inspector of the Pentagon, opened after complaints by analysts of the Centcom.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the Chief Inspector’s investigation is ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree when interpreting complex data, and the intelligence services and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital national security topics.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American bombing in Iraq and Syria (as now more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense claim) is achieving its goal.
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the Central Command to provide true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
Criticism of intelligence on the Islamic State echoes the controversy that took place more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, because of the protest of many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team came to the conclusion that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread outside the Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after testimony in the Senate, which many MPs considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in the Central Command by General Joseph L. Votel.
The US wins 4 consecutive times in women's hockey on the grass, thus approaching the decisive battle with Britain
Having once scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Beam opened the score Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team when the Americans defeated the Indian team 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she’s not sure if she’d ever done something like that.
“I’m not going to use my mind,” she said.
I'm not really one of those people who keeps track of their goals.
Here's what she knows: the Americans score 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after losing Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The UK and US teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualify for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams, and who - the second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of rivals from the Netherlands, the leaders of another group, a little while before the games of the quarterfinals begin.
However, the Saturday game shows that the Americans here made a noise with their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a grass hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the finals.
Then came 2012, when everything was not going well for her and her teammates.
The following year, Koeig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness,” she said.
In London, we didn’t have the productivity that we have now.
We completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the score in the first half of the game by throwing an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in their own hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and abruptly sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The dry win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's hit.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the fury of the Olympic Games - "Zen" jumping on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time you have, this is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem immutable and unavoidable, a raging combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself, there is a burning torch that is transmitted from archer to swimmer, to gymnast, to triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors’ conversations in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simone Biles, Katy Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first to participate in the Olympics, a handsome guy with holes on his cheeks, could well be among those celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a fencing player.
But 28-year-old Dooley from Lake Forest, California, competes for gold in the Olympic trampoline jumping competition.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with a pneumatic pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, his long reign.
But if I am allowed to speak out in a timid manner in defense of my personal addiction, allow me to draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were an Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to competitions, they never won medals in trampoline jumps, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and the Russians, as a rule, share among themselves the men's awards, and the Chinese and Canadians - women's.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has the charm of an outsider, in particular because, for the unenlightened ear, it is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but just a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have a comic potential — a cartoonish whipping of endless jumps — but also the grace of gymnastics and jumping into the water, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word trampoline is derived from the Spanish word el trampol<0xC3><0xAD>n, which means “springboard for jumping into the water”.
Winners jump on a giant trampoline, taking to the air by almost 30 feet, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and flippers) before the final landing on their feet.
They are rated for performance, difficulty and "flight times", according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is ahead.
Candidates for the medal must go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes towards the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They strive not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the cameras, for another irritating line: a world or Olympic record.
This persistent aspiration is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But in my opinion, it is a bit tiring when watching the games.
From him jumping on the trampoline gives a break.
The direction of the trampoline is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps, seems weightless like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they, of course, can not do without competition or difficulties, but during the whole program there is no crazy zeal for the finish, no jumps in length, only a wonderful, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
It is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women's qualifying competitions, followed by the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at one o'clock Eastern European time; the men's - on Saturday, also at one o'clock.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of a day program starting at 2:00 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily seen in a common landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to the desired views and objectification – as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts from the United States – Dooley is only waiting for his new enthusiastic crowd of fans.
“Generation Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally injured during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of a split?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable countries, a firm ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s reaction was brutal.
Witnesses said police officers shot dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protests, allegedly taken at the end of last year or earlier this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they put their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights now calls for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from falling apart, and it will be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy – human rights organizations constantly mention government repression – the opposition in the country was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed or exiled to remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising,” said Seium Teshome, a university lecturer in central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this vague, controversial border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the unrest and rearm themselves.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, boiling in the depths of the soul for several years, now flare up.
The first seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and Internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that was how they organized themselves for the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara of Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in lowland areas.
But that is also changing.
“We will act together under a single principle,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromo.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of anxiety is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia’s prime minister for 17 years until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at recognizing the first signals of discontent and using scouts to retrieve data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desaleni, appeared out of nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said appeared to be elections that the government blocked and then rigged the results.
During the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in a smaller number than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed gratitude to Ethiopian leaders for the forward-looking development of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this has not stopped the growing domestic discontent with the Ethiopian government.
It takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned businesses last month, and anti-Tigray hate on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts say the protesters are embarrassing the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it does not want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And it will be difficult to pass through this tight rope," Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to cover up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The clarification raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to speak to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, as they had to explain statements that he probably did not mean.
Speaking at a congress on Wednesday night, Trump strongly insisted on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just a scoundrel.
The post was the exact opposite of a statement made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his remarks by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton delivered competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried again to return to the subject.
Again, by resorting to Twitter, he warned that Clinton’s plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he drew widespread criticism, practically expressing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is permissible in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing some of the messages that resonate with his fans, watching how they act, and then ‘explaining’ them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who conducted the language analysis of both candidates.
But I also think that he is cautious in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to treat them differently.
Instead of easing statements for the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more egregious tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating, published on Friday, showed that Trump is ceding Clinton with a large margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going on a par with her in Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and not understanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has been the object of heightened attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump’s most prominent deputies, has made serious efforts to protect the candidate in an interview given to CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown tiny organization, he called it non-threatening, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans say the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, has allowed ISIS to develop because it has failed to resolve the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for defaming every word he said and being biased toward him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" TV experts who were trying to figure it out and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as an unnecessary confirmation that he is not fit for president.
Once Displaced Coffee Shop Returns to Greenpoint
Verb Coffee House was a shabby, cash-only place in Williamsberg that didn’t have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of her room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
The store "Soap Sherry", which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals lamented her as the last loss in the city’s revitalization.
Artist Molly Krabaple tweeted, “New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb has now become a soap store.”
But while New York is constantly changing, it is in turn being updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened in November last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager of the new place.
He started working at Verba in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor him in a new place, he said that he would be happy to do it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, has left much in his former form.
Verb works with the same bagel distributor and bought the same coffee machine model.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu includes sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are toppings made of capers or fried onions.
There are dishes of brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they prepare freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he drew attention to the steady flow of old regular customers.
“Many former customers were also squeezed out of Williamsberg,” he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who is 34, used to live in Williamsburg and often visited the Verb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still drove there.
After the closure of Verba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verb,” she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, although on that day, instead of regular ice-coffee, she ordered blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to Verb since 2003.
He came in before work and ordered the same thing invariably.
“At fifteen minutes past eight, every day, like clockwork, I came in, and they cooked my bagel with butter and all the stuffing for me,” he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he will change something with the help of bacon, egg or cheese on a bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended by the fact that the soap store once took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of “Soap Sherry” offered to make a special soap for “Verba”, using coffee from a coffee shop, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we might agree to their offer,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also favored this coffee shop.
One of these new customers has translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he plans to find a place for him in the showcase to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has other benefits.
The local juice point plans to bottle and sell cold-cooked coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the neighboring building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include in the menu their favorite dishes.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and shared that he was killed with grief when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Whitt said that when he went inside and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long have I wanted to smell it,” he said.
The Depressed Food of Depression in "The Plate Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Meryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and for dessert - prune pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans about how to eat.”
The couple living in Brooklyn Heights are experts in food history.
Coah’s latest book, “Chinese Ragu,” was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of living in a rented apartment in the Lower East Side through food in her book, House 97 on the Street Fruit Garden.
Their new collaborative work, The Plain Meal, which will be published Tuesday by Harper, is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing some of their own culinary solidarity, they met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in Flatiron Quarter that has been operating since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange Crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roll, the couple considered it a good starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
“Roulettes were in great demand,” Siegelman said.
There was peanut roll, liver roll, bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you have eaten as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe wrinkled.
“He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women cooked for male farm workers, and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the starving Europeans during World War I. The Plate meal describes how the country coped with the fact that it suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, challenging topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Just as difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and baked goods, became staples of food; baked goods were “a great way to recycle curds,” Siegelman said, “because cooks could hide inappetitive ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.”
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become an economically distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While doing research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman cooked a dish from that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not a success,” Coe said.
Siegelman added: “It was very strange.”
Peanut butter does not fit baked onions at all.
This was typical of many household recipes.
More than ever before and ever since, household experts — including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943 — have managed the country’s eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget makers,” take the challenge, and transform a burda like grated carrot spaghetti into delicious dishes.
The "Dish Table" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Particularly piquant are the stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “let them eat pies”.
Publicly praising the simple farmhouse of Iowa State during his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
“He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate practically in the gilded dining room, putting on a tuxedo.
He was fantastically disconnected from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most miserable food in Washington, D.C., but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked."
Many of the cooking techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and on how science has been used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Siegelman's mother - that she could not throw out food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of being careless about food,” Coe said.
Siegelman recalls: "She seriously poisoned people."
There was an unfortunate case of profiteers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, he and Coe got the dessert they had prepared at home: a prune dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called mousse of prunes,” Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes catchy names.
There were no whipped creams, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Coe asked for the supplement twice.
In the voice of a confident budget maker, he said to his wife: "A few roubles of walnuts would be useful here."
Arrest of defendants in the case of a mass fight at the Khovan cemetery extended until November 14
The Presnensky court left until November 14 under arrest the defendants in the case of a mass fight at the Khovan cemetery, satisfying the relevant petition of the investigation.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14 at the Khovan cemetery there was a massive fight of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons, which killed three people.
Former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and a lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov is charged with organizing the murder.
The issue of the second indexation of pensions for 2016 can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was announced on August 12, Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters for how much it is necessary to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations have been made.
Now economists are summing up the half-year, and we will complete this work in the next two or three weeks,” – quotes Holodets “Interfax”.
Commenting on the proposed by the head of the Center for strategic development Alexey Kudrin scheme of increasing the retirement age by six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet does not consider this topic.
At the end of July, it became known that the Government agreed on the position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan went to the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle from the position lying at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points and took the first place - this is a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan became the second - 628.9 was.
Eight of the best athletes reached the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen has demanded an international investigation into the circumstances of the coup attempt in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d'état," French newspaper Le Monde quoted Gülen as saying.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
Gulen, however, denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization never claimed political power.
A court in Istanbul earlier arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen in absentia.
The attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead to Reimburse Lawyers During Hepatitis C Patent Dispute with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to seek reimbursement for legal fees it has incurred in a lawsuit over a patent for a hepatitis C drug with drugmaker Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge has ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead’s medicines, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical acts.
On Thursday, U.S. District Court Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for costs incurred in challenging the lawsuit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to laboratory work underpinning sofosbuvir, Gilead’s active ingredient.
U.S.-backed armed forces claim to have seized full control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of Manbij's allied military council told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting sweeping operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton Earned $10.75 Million in 2015 and Paid 34.2 Percent of Federal Tax Rate
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns on Friday, which showed the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in speech fees, and the former Secretary of State claimed $3 million in revenue from publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia along with his wife Anna Holton released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign advisor Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
Contrary to them, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and breaks his past promises to make his tax returns public.
It’s commonplace for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although the law doesn’t require them to.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the State Tax Service’s audit as the reason for his refusal to disclose his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s declaration.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of checks.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Matt Romney and other fellow Republicans in 2012, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton grabbed hold of the issue and released an online video Friday that highlighted prominent Republicans who had persuaded Trump to release tax returns.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades without exception: to make his tax returns public,” she said.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a business columnist for the New York Times on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants as saying it may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he too is under IRS scrutiny and that Trump is “fearful” not of tax collection agencies, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign headquarters released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks improve protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania are using an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into settlements — throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, along with the U.S. Committee for the Conservation of Nature took over its promotion, teaching volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, World Elephant Day will be dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented the toolkit ... we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, resulting in much more confidence that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” said Damian Bell, executive director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps are to ignite the torch in front of the elephant that broke the border and give signals with the horn.
If it is not able to scare away, then throw the so-called "cloud of chili".
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the baby in the condom, and its end is twisted, only the wick is left outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a bang, spraying the fine dust of chili powder into the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant to the other side.
The extreme measure is a launcher that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
So far, 32 Turkish diplomats have not returned to Turkey, who left the country after a coup attempt in July this year.
Such data was provided by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we recalled 208 personnel diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people without objective reasons and explanations did not return,” the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
In July, there was an attempted coup in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially declared that the coup failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of the highest and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
The Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code at the “demand” of the Arabs, said the channel RT News
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has unleashed a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code on its list, with officials citing “requests” from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary The Shoah, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the Lanzmann Hotel, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the opportunity to dial Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this question at the hotel administration desk.
The response he received there, according to Lanzmann, “shocked him.”
The hotel clerk said the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain."
The reason behind this move caused even more anger from the director.
“Most of our guests are Arab, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed,” Lanzman said.
Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the incident a “terrible disgrace,” according to the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible shame.
The fact that it happened in Germany and in this chain of hotels is an even greater disgrace.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some have argued that Kempinski’s hotel was simply “on the go” with the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"We would be ashamed," another post said, indicating that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to drop any charges, calling the incident a “failure to investigate” and “apologizing” to Lanzmann, the newspaper Der Spiegel reported.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel on the quick list,” Kempinski told the Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
Riots began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen writing graffiti on the walls against interim President Michael Thamer.
The latest protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9% compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Jagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is a growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Jagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to 158 million dollars.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which, the ambassador hopes, will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yezd, which preserve the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to twist nuts in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the general director of the concern "Almaz - Antey", "lack of work" and "loss of trust".
Gennady Bendersky has been appointed head of the NGO for the next three years.
Information about the dismissal of Neskrodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause widespread resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the context of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the defense-industrial complex has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from the public.
The removal of Neskrodov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of ordering the industry.
NGO "Almaz" - the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (AMS) marine and ground-based.
Currently, Almaz is working on the creation of the Polyment Redoute and Morpheus air defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskrodov is caused by the failure of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morphea" began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
"Polyment-Redout" should become the main air defense system on the newest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, in several years of testing, not a single truly successful test has been carried out.
However, as far as I can judge, there is no unequivocal fault of "Diamond", - said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning may occur with the S-500.
The development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should enter the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that “the work is being carried out on a planned basis and everything will be completed within the set deadlines”, although in 2014 the Ministry acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskrodov, who has been in charge of "Diamond" since 2011.
Kornev noted that failures of deadlines for projects can be both a cause and a cause of dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, likes silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their positions at will, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension occurred publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the "Diamond" was perhaps a figure of snide and resisted the "discharges" coming down from above.
Apparently, the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
At the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the Ministry of Defense and do not perform the tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the failed managers (the machinations at the shipyard "Zvezda").
Increased attention to the problems of the sector is paid personally by the President.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the defense industry’s managers, seeking to have a loyal staff of directors at hand who will carry out orders received from above.
This is a far from ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state does not have other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry is certainly not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning" of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army acquired a new quality with the coming to the post of Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president adopted the famous proverb “If you want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military power and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which cemented Moscow's spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
This is evidenced by the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually resulted in the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, perhaps there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such conditions, the only allies of our country are the Navy and the Army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottish Callum Skinner races the finish line, causing the British to seize bicycle gold
Scottishman Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio Velodrome last night, resulting in the British team trio defending their title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the strongest, which his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, running along the finish line to snatch the victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the rights to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi claimed the rights to the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycling Championships in London, despite Hoy having since ended his career.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialist participant Jamie Staff.
They did so at the time Hindes appeared.
Hoy's departure also created a void that Kean Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man held by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman that had now been realised.
Hindes, Kenny – champions with Hoy four years ago – and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was right behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, where Hindes drove on a larger gearbox to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy observed from his seat as an invited BBC expert and caught Skinner, Kenny and Hindes's gaze as they stepped onto the pedestal.
23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said, “This is a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After triumphing in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the track after an unsuccessful start.
He later renounced the comment, and there was no way to appeal from Britain’s competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, “I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the stand.”
We've all met as a team in the last three months.
We lost so many races with a world-renowned name that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
This is one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven out of 10 race titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of the progress made in the last five months, then the velodrome is waiting for five more successful days.
With the form shown by Kenny, it’s not beyond the ability to imagine him repeating Hoi’s feat of winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Games.
This would allow you to see Kenny — who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a sacred date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) — bring his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like Hoi's.
The next time Kenny competes in the sprint, which starts today and is played for three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said: “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come here to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he must get a knighthood."
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit of four.
They finished in 3:51,943.
The world record set for winning gold in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the respective women’s event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rosell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milnhavi improved the world record by showing a time of 4:13,260.
The UK team has come to rely on a powerful team of cyclists to take possession of the mid-term Olympic Games and earn a bunch of medals.
After in fact exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not least the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and harassment, and the resignation of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the race of the first evening at the velodrome, it seems that the now legendary glory of Britain in reaching the peaks at the right time may just be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria — as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers — is under threat because the power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows a decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies granted to support the plant’s operation.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa’s Portland plant.
As many as 2,000 jobs – directly and indirectly – could be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the power plant in Anglesey last year.
The Portland metallurgical plant of the company Alcoa loses money and risks closing.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later - due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by a joint short-term venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
“AGL expects that the Portland facility will continue to operate, that is, that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, these contracts are the so-called “hedged contracts” that were supposed to come into effect in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to generate their share of revenue in fiscal year 2017," the company said in a statement.
Any potential impact on AGL’s earnings from fiscal year 2018 is currently limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its accounts by $187 million in view of the “pending termination.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect Alcoa’s ability to operate a metallurgical plant or provide electricity to a metallurgical plant.”
The American company said that in 2010, it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was supposed to come into force in November of this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, Stephen Mikkelsen, head of AGL’s operations service, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy each year and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity] market.
For us, as a producer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan's mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has defiled at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news about the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of "The Kardashian Family"?), prepared reality-video, in which the whole Kardashian-Jenner family (deboshers Rob and Caitlin, also joined them by the most beloved uncle of show business, producer of "The Kardashian Family" Ryan Ozrestyk pozby
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to the birthday (Sicrest utters the phrase: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 am), but Chris needed this fame to get to other girls in one way or another.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim get on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling issue of the year.
Thick, similar to a gift edition, rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the portal Fashionista, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News about which of the stars will fall on his cover is expected with such anticipation that in the last two years, the photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover certainly featured more “celebrities who work as models” than “models who are celebrities.”
The winner of the Oscars and face of the Dior brand Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, described by the magazine as an “outstanding model” of her generation, falls into the first category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner falls into all these categories).
These are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on last year's cover, this year was one of the most successful of her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Jenner’s position in the fashion world, given her past reality TV star, should have always remained shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria's Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment."
These sentiments were again blurred after news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But focusing on dissatisfaction does not make sense.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's defiling for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you a tonal cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own apps, available through a paid subscription.
She sells her own photographs of Cindy Crawford’s daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality TV show.
Public Legal Centers Deny Service to 160,000 People a Year
Every year, more than 160,000 least-protected people are denied service in public legal centres, as the sector prepares for an effect that will further reduce funding for activities that are already at the limit of opportunity.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to fight unfair deprivation of property, and so on – have already been turned down in an attempt to obtain free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating beyond capacity are preparing for further cuts.
As of June next year, these legal centers are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland Public Law Centers, said that according to the latest National Association of Public Law Centers Census report, thousands of people a year are being rejected.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public law centers are constantly receiving insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving violent relationships, people with unmanaged and debilitating debts, families going through divorce, unfairly fired workers — all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can’t get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less-protected Queenslanders will be forced to deal with complex legal issues without help.
We call on Justice Secretary and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to cancel these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and the government of Palaschuk is time to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign headquarters was sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun
Reports from New York state that Donald Trump’s campaign headquarters was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after the report that his North Carolina operations director had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state’s pre-election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited several months for the problem to be resolved internally, but realized that “this will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pulled out the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed a bullet at Vincent's kneecap," Bordini said in the complaint.
Having complained to the local and regional administration of the election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four more people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, according to the appeal.
“Guns don’t have to shoot to cause damage,” Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a furor by telling listeners in North Carolina that the “Second Amendment people” — understood as gun owners and his fans — could take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to choose judges.
Trump’s campaign said the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of the violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Phillip - for the threat of physical violence, insulting actions and inflicting moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has campaigned controversially.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Mecklenburg County High Court (Charlotte).
Britain should steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring resurgence and prosperity not only in our local communities and in London as a whole, but throughout the country.
To me, it was exactly that huge advantage Heathrow had, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our nationalities and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympic Games brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again, creating opportunities for locals and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games and that we would find ourselves in a difficult position on the world stage.
The sceptics were wrong in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for the majority, not just for the narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from the T5, the airport’s best terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2, built in the middle of the world’s two busiest runways.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 Olympic Games in London were a huge success for the UK and I’m sure Heathrow’s expansion will be as well.
It is time for us to steer the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former Trade Attaché of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing "cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking ads
For companies that make money from online advertising, attempts to bypass ad-blocking software are a cat-and-mouse game, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users could update their filters in the program to block social media ads again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site would change the layout around its ads, making it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims it was able to circumvent the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of mutual struggle between the open-source ad blocker community and those who try to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big a problem advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year; nearly four times the number of people who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook’s mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a profitable enough article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced it was going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how ads target them.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are of concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Advertising blockers are a rude tool, so we’ve instead focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to transfer control into people’s hands.
Woman Moved On Swiss Highway In Episode Of Obvious Suicide
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling for witnesses after the woman was moved by several vehicles on the highway early on Thursday morning in a blatant suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near the Walrus in the canton of Vaux just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay down on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, the police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a Swiss woman aged 49, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several of the drivers involved have already been interviewed, but the identity of some has yet to be determined, police said, urging them and someone else who witnessed the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a "logical" step in this situation, said lawyer Gilles Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
This is what the prosecutor should determine,” Hofstetter said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case – both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway – a verdict was issued that motorists could not expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hit and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, the court heard.
The court found that a policewoman – who responded to an emergency call – was driving the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information on Thursday's incident near the walrus should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus may have once been habitable, according to NASA’s new climate model.
Scientists from the Nassau Institute for the Study of Space Goddard developed a model for the study of the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot anhydrous surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have conditions similar to Earth's.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus' low rotation speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and still spin slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create living conditions and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus was also favored by the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a press release.
This heats up the planet’s surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella that protects the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of the sun’s heat.
The result is average climate temperatures, which, surprisingly, are a few degrees colder than today on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen disappeared, there was only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect — that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey at Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team’s decision-making process.
Executive Vice President/CEO of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey business with energy, passion and determination," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities should perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions are not currently met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
Avalanche announced a score of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and was five points behind Wild in the fight for a second concessionary entry to the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups, two each with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea Oilers Resume Talks and Suspend Strike
Workers’ strikes on oil workers’ salaries in the North Sea have been suspended and all sides are moving to a new round of talks, the two leaders said.
Strikes against the oil service company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve ongoing disputes,” the joint statement said.
We will hold several full-time meetings over the next few weeks, beginning next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
The unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed against potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates paid to contract workers working in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cuts came after a 10 percent reduction in rates for contract employees working on shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas operations in countries of up to 10 as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling prices for untreated oil: the economic situation has deteriorated due to the decision to leave the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labor conflicts that arose in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just some,” he said.
Less than $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, as well as how periods of rotation correlate with the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riball, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Pleiades cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they never will again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these growing stars eject large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a inhibitory effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation speed begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots — such as sunspots.
The latest catalogue of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes slower than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades, we see that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster tend to be very light stars," Riball said.
Since the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory to match the properties of stars with rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both younger and older," Riball said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational speeds in three new papers, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea is being conducted by two departments, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the detainees’ involvement in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armeniask, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials believe that not all of the saboteurs were able to be detained.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the World Cup-2018.
On August 11, the Executive Committee of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous footballer who previously played in Moscow "Spartak" as a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was the mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartak", "Zhemchuzhina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as the Warsaw "Legia", which became the winner of the national championship and the cube.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed as soon as possible and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Pannikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set the goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian national team to the semi-finals and win medals.
As the coach himself said, as a priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give players an opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will be held on August 31 in Antalya - this will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of the head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the Russian national team at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team on himself.
Clamped between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, this country with a population of 2.4 million people has achieved tremendous success, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries perceive free primary and secondary education as self-evident, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to “reimburse costs”.
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has become free.
The authorities of the country are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past decade.
Contrary to the international trend of increasing inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to 1993, the Gini ratio, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69 per cent in 1993 to less than 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased, from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was well ahead of the United States and other wealthy nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable ranking - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index", which is compiled by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia is able to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is around 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least according to traditional methods of estimation, is still quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high HIV/AIDS rate - almost 17% of the population are infected.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is one of the countries with above-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some difficulties that are inherent in underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
In the deserts of the country live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another must be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it faces the consequences of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country is solving the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to health facilities in northern Namibia are Angolan citizens.
Nobody in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that their neighbors were not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, participate in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Furthermore, the Namibian Government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that income from Namibia’s natural resources must be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to aim for maximum profits from the sale of the country’s resources, and are revising investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
According to the head of state Hage Geingob, the media often say what he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia’s key resources are exhausted.
Some - such as fishing - refer to renewables, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious shortcomings — racism, colonialism, inequality and low levels of development — can embark on a path to shared prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard about the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand with a total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only from one burial, known as "grave number 43", 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg were extracted.
However, the official status of the world’s oldest gold may soon move to a seemingly inconspicuous beads found by archaeologists in July this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsite.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Junacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Junacite of Pazardzhik district.
The bead is a golden stripe rolled up into a ring.
Yavor Boyadzhiev, head of the excavations at Tella Yunati, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it is older than the gold of Varna by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
Technologies that allow to date metal with impeccable accuracy do not currently exist.
How do you know which gold is the oldest?
Apparently, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I’m quite sure that the gold of Youngsters is older than the gold of Varna.”
It’s a find of extreme importance: it looks like a tiny object, but it’s big enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters Boyadzhiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as repeatedly and more carefully study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the beads with the highest possible accuracy.
The location also explains a lot.
Tell Yunatsi is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Today, Tell Jun<0xC3><0xA1>tsi is considered the oldest "city" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, metal processing developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban-type settlements began to emerge around the metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatsite is probably the oldest, as artifacts from 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yunachi the prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This place is a thousand years older than Sumer,” Boyadjiev says, referring to the conventional view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
It was there that the first cities appeared in the usual sense of the word.
Excavations of Tell Jun<0xC3><0xA1>tsi have been underway since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of a fortress wall, which once reached three meters in height, were found.
Not much has survived from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, a "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunatsite is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All birds are depicted at rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 BC - possibly by Indo-European tribes coming from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but they had horses and weapons.
The three-meter fortification walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts appear every year, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna’s golden luxury had to be preceded by something – something like a tiny gold beads created in Tella Yunatsi.
Porsche artificially aged model 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is carried out manually by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
The "retro bow" is, for example, in the special color of the Etna Blue body, which was developed back in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the targa received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheels, as well as some details of the body, painted in "white-gold metallic".
In the interior of retro drawings is noticeably less: it differs, by and large, gray-blue design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case and a richly finished album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists Porsche Exclusive did not touch: the retro-targeting characteristics coincides with the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharged volume of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S can accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology, which prevented the concealment of advertising on social network pages, provoked the developers of solutions to block advertising for response actions.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote”, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
In an effort to defraud the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, the solution from AdBlock Plus, along with commercial ads, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook regretted the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social network publication TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop site Facebook, will be ready in the next hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of "arms race", trying to beat each other, the injured side were users who missed interesting recordings from friends or saw advertising where they are not used to seeing it.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have recently been hotly debated.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear in court <0xC2><0xB7> Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been investigated in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The charge brought against the 54-year-old man is very serious - the commission of violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlova Street in Murmansk committed acts of sexual nature with violence against a 20-year-old girl.The criminal case with an approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of this article provides for the maximum penalty in the form of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia cross-country Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing popularity in China class of cars, combining the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is a pickup truck Rich New.
Many Western firms Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the void of the exhibition halls "Crocus Expo" will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be the corporation Dongfeng Motor, which has great views on the Russian market and intends in the near future to offer our motorists a number of interesting novelties.
One of them will be the crossover Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a price tag, and the issue of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 on the results of June sales managed to get to the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic cover on the lower perimeter of the body, it can be considered as a crossover.
Crossvan is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden laths, but shown in the photo a large vertical touch screen "like Tesla" on the center console was only on early exhibition copies of the crossover, and cars with "music" came on sale easier.
Five of the seven seats fold easily, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum volume of the trunk - 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is provided with only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a budget-saving appetite for the owner at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The pickup truck Rich New is well known to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly refined Chinese stylists design.
Despite the outdated design, this model is still in stable demand from the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious "workhorse".
At a similar price, Rich New will surely be of interest to Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become excessively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: gasoline 2.4 liters (137 hp) or turbo diesel 2.5 liters (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and with a rigidly connected "front".
It will be at the Dongfeng stand and the new flagship sedan A9, its Russian premiere the representative office of the Chinese company announced in June.
Minvan-like crossovers in the Chinese market are becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng line consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Transport tax notices will cease to be sent by mail - website Behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Tax Inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notifications of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are used to the scheme that has not changed in years: in the summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
This year, however, many will not wait.
The fact is that the tax inspection without too much noise changed the procedure for notification of citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Cabinet of the taxpayer" on the official website of the department of order.ru, notifications will come in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing.
The novelty will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme has the owners of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office in August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal cabinet" immediately after the drafting, while the letter will go a few days and can be completely lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspection exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to seriously save on mailing.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some may have registered in a “personal account” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without knowing it, will fall into the category of defaulters with all the consequences that follow.
Access to the "Personal Account of the taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal gosuslugi.ru, by means of an electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained in person at any tax office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid before December 1.
Notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the improvements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not confuse the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
The G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human to its masters is foreign.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-strong flying hammer with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping the "muscles" of the crazy "helicopter", the masters took advantage of the 5.5-liter inflatable "eight".
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 s, and now the flying "brick" is capable of bursting in 5.3 s.
However, accelerations from average speeds are certainly given it noticeably better.
The speed ceiling is frightening: if the standard G 63 is faster than 210 km / h does not drive, then the tuning all-terrain vehicle with the deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze 250 km / h.
Outside, the car is almost indistinguishable from its factory source, except for other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR dimension 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced an impressive concept coupe length of 6 m, which will be presented as part of the Elegance Competition in Pebble Beach.
Mercedes-Benz is going to compete with the “green sub-brand” BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate trademark.
In the coming years, a minimum of four eco-friendly novelties are expected.
