Russian President Vladimir Putin signed the law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the term and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) in the procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of obligations by customers in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already executed state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem on special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with dishonest customers who concluded contracts not backed by financing, tried in every way to evade the assumed obligations for payment and included in the contracts illegal conditions.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Prosecutor’s Office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, according to the results of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials were brought to disciplinary responsibility, administrative - 533, 75 materials were submitted to investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of them were initiated criminal cases.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
Moreover, these huge sums were not accumulated as a result of non-payment of multi-billion dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs by much more modest amounts have led to fabulous debts.
Here's a typical case.
The head of a small company won a competition for the provision of social transportation services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial burden on wages, taxes, and loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor’s office.
In some areas, the problem has been eliminated as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, revealed by prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor’s office operates under manual crisis management.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations detected by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are dealt with.
Such operational meetings have already been held this year in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in the Part of Establishing Administrative Liability of Officials of the Customer for Violation of the Period and Procedure of Payment of Goods (Works, Services) in Procurement to Provide State and Municipal Needs" signed last week by the President of Russia will be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment of goods, works and services for state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offense, he will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative amendments in practice.
Civil Rights Group Announces Moving Warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning to colored people traveling to Missouri because of the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads: “The National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population Travellers warning, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests and citizens of Missouri to be particularly attentive and cautious when traveling around the state in connection with a number of questionable racist-related incidents that have recently occurred here.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, a recent Missouri law has made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately often choose minorities as their targets.
“You are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during a trip to the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office, according to which black drivers are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped on the road than white drivers.
“The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the money with them for collateral or inform their relatives that they are traveling through the territory of the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making it the 16th most hate crimes in the state.
Also, the travel warning is a response to a new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings to travelers in Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said was supposed to increase the number of checks on racial grounds.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but more recently, public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified gunmen shelled a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported, citing the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Egypt.
During the shootout, two people, including one policeman, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested, the second managed to escape.
Rostourism supports the law on the cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rostourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV channel that he "positively" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the carriage of outerwear and a mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to state this, to say that it is to outerwear, to an umbrella, to a mobile phone, to an iPad or even some computer will not have a relationship," - said the head of Rostourism.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free baggage for non-refundable air ticket.
The issue is that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and executors to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out full rehabilitation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," the president said.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
“I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row is checked, here too the measure needs to be known, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures,” he said.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General’s Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin in a direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed about the problems with conducting economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are associated with a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new temple in Utah.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the representatives of the indigenous small peoples of the North "Rahtynya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well visible from afar, so it will serve as a road beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, construction works will be completed this year, domes have been installed, church bells are available.
The IGIRM REB of the fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, fishing gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
Locals are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an outdoor diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and carefully packs the cigarettes in an iron box seized from his office.
After the end of the conversation, the businessman heads to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $ 500 local, - said Chang.
You know, since I was a child, I just developed a reflex: you can not throw a candy fanny on the bridge, immediately fined.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed - the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, as if in a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to jail.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
In general, corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How in Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, understood on the spot observer "AIF".
No one here is thinking about abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government does not care about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue for a long time.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at Changi Airport, carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
The man was eventually hanged.
After that, drug couriers are diligently circling our country.
In Singapore, it is the duty of the law to respect ALL in a row, not just the humble and the poor.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a vice-premier, a well-known artist or a resident of the European Union.
In this case, there is one option: if you find half a kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a bunch of warnings, by a simple miracle you are given - how many bans in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of a doctor.
A tourist on arrival will not take gum, but it is worth sticking a "rubber" in the subway, a fine of 1,000 local dollars will be infused.
In four days, I met two people with white plates around their necks: “I’m trashed.”
For thrown by the urn cucumbers in addition to a fine is often sentenced to "refer to the janitors": a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays the "criminal", who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is activated - the door is blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing and even excessive watering of a houseplant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers should not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case,” Mohammed Kabir-Kajariya, the owner of the local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone being attracted to breaking them.
Why are they preserved?
Don’t let people relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is strictly monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone in the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the violator himself will be hit with sticks on the "back", and the seller will also be pushed out and imprisoned.
It is thanks to such strict laws that offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got drunk at the wheel.
After the introduction of fines for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows: if stopped, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent to jail.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a guest from the United States was appalled by the general wealth of the inhabitants, "terrifyingly clean airport" and "cultured nature".
They say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle it should not be.
The first days in Singapore and rightly afraid to throw a piece of paper on the pavement, you catch yourself if you went into the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly - "the rupture of the pattern": at the bus stop there are plastic cups.
“How is that?” you wonder.
That's why the Singaporeans are laughing.
It's all happening.
Not every such "crime" will be caught in place, but you should know that if you are calculated, you will not get away with it - because you have broken the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the government in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I moved very carefully - motorcyclists often grab smartphones and cameras from tourists.
The center of Paris is full of dirty bastards and beggars.
In our streets, too, not everyone is trying to throw garbage into the urns.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
This is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was strapped to the wheel until they began to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And we have to think, in Russia, people would also like clean streets, no garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
These are corporal punishments, thank you, don't.
At the very least, Singapore’s laws are worth looking at.
Nothing sacred?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he begins to fight the statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried to find its meaning, and especially the meaning attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller murmured at Acosta: “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you’re talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
Miller correctly laid out the facts, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely, / the unfortunate scum of your abundant shores."
“Unfortunate waste” has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not do literary studies - he made it clear that these people are not expected in Trump's America.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus – and her friends, who fought to put her words on the statue’s base after her death – understood very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The thunderous Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who announced the coming of Trump, reasoned in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative, carrying the flames of America to the world lying in darkness: “Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against the custom, Limbo really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who seek refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is the only source of their power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eileed Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots in the UK national team
Neil Blake, the director of the UK Athletics Federation’s game, said the 16-man Scottish squad at the World Cup would make “a significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for the 2017 London Championships starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland "something special is born" and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know this and we are trying to understand and will support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s because of what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done has to be done.
The British Athletics Federation: What they did has to be done.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why it happened, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish athletes are claiming medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah over the 5,000 m distance; and Eylid Doyle's team chose their captain.
"Eileen is humble.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scots or not, and where they live or train, have left this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Aileed put into her were wonderful.”
The winner of the Commonwealth Championship silver medal, which will run the 400m with obstacles at its fifth World Cup, says that 16 Scots in the British national team - it's "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in mid-distance running, beat five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will participate in the 1500 m race, is another Scottishman who is worth paying attention to: he has a successful season behind him, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and at the Annual competitions.
Doyle recalls his first World Cup when, apart from her, the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots not only entered the national team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
“The captain of the team is chosen by other team members, so it was a huge honor anyway, but knowing that your comrades voted for you and you were elected is a very special thing for me,” she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who joined the national team.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to get into his arena and take part in the competitions and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Blocking Facebook Critics: Don’t Run for Public Office if You’re Not Ready to Listen to Criticism from Voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to critics.
As Washington said in 1783, “Freedom of speech can be taken away, and we, the deaf and the dumb, will be led as sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I’m going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor’s subordinates called the lawsuit insignificant, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of “well and what”.
“It’s just Facebook,” many will say.
But that's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a remarkably popular Republican governor in a predominantly democratic state.
It ranks second in the approval rating among the country’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in running the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and jokingly shows off his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is declared as an official public forum and is run by the administration for taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply a moderation of comments.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters raging online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is a Catholic.
Lakshmi lawyer Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in a post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called screw-up, instead of admitting they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is far less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical advances, or arresting and shutting the mouths of protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump was sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. District Judge from Alexandria James K. Casheris, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning the voter from his Facebook account.
In Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It doesn't have to be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal spending was about as disruptive as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belizarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to the newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington Papers online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comforts for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The Northern Irishman, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and was moving towards the final round last year until he lost to Paul Ilse, is attached to the new seat and serves as the tournament’s representative on behalf of club founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance Club being built and we’re seeing it come to fruition with this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is a big fan of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Ils is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both the European tournament and the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremedura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athlete Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year, is returning to battle in his homeland.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said Helensborough resident Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I enjoyed playing again, and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
This trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Wusnem and senior champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if there is one person in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if there are two or more people.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
The tunnels above the highways, capable of absorbing carbon monoxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, according to the publication Autocar, reported positive test results of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built of some of the latest polymeric materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial vehicles on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to transport, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court changed the punishment of the disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years of the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamaev’s disease “obstructs his stay in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, serving a sentence in a colony of the general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, a court at a visiting meeting in a prison released a man from custody.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia’s “Golden Land”
When I'm cooking lunch, Bardina Degei doesn't use the stove.
She rarely even uses the pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts a sweet potato, which here is called a "note", right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her homework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet serves as a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many of the men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one dares to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, raising their hands in public before the occupying forces.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which retains tight control over the region while preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabira, and then a five-hour shake-up by a rented car.
There is no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted rusty in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians got here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of Christian missionaries, the mee pago papuas worshipped a god named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to wear only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
This is Indonesia’s golden land.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves, the cost of which is estimated at $ 78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands of greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights activists say more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything,” the report, published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shock – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because accidents happen every week,” says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Nuts were delayed as Papuan resources attracted an influx of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese shops, "varungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to withstand the competition.
“Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 24-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mom-mother (woman) of Papua – have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequalities and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” he said.
In fact, just two months after the October inauguration of Jokowi, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas hymns at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after some time returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation escalated.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered on the football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought ritual hunting bows with them and performed the vaita, the dance of the Papuan mee pago tribe: they ran in circles and depicted bird singing.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation intensified, soldiers on internal radio were given the order: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” he said in an official document seen by TIME magazine but not published in local media.
Sixty-five-year-old Jeremiah Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
The local resident Alfius Jova was hit three times, as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, tells us.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw him dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, a senior police inspector in Papua, told reporters that his officers were only “defending” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papua police spokesman Pujo Sulisiyo said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the killings only reached Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi delivered a fervent speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights violations.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the nineties or early zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed,” he said.
Viranto then renounced his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through the court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the Paniai victims met with such statements with grim distrust.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there hasn’t been any change at all,” says Johannes.
“I’m tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid I’m going to get arrested by the military, I’m afraid I’m going to get shot.”
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury the four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired on villagers in the neighboring district of Deiyai.
A clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to a hospital killed one person and injured 17 others, including children.
A man, 24-year-old Ravianus Dove, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at the officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But local residents claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"We were in such a panic, we are afraid of retaliation," said the 29-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed to the hospital.
“I stayed at home for two days.”
The parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account and a mobile police brigade be recalled from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development causes dissatisfaction of the meye, moni, dani and damal tribes scattered throughout the green central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by arranging sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and unreasonably detained by the military under the pretext of “defending national independence” in Paniai in recent years.
Some never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Paniai is considered a “sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally inaccessible.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four to five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten tubers of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has increased between indigenous Papuans and new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and affluent migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village...because there’s no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, the restrictions on the work of international media remain rigid.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basile Longchamp were deported from Papua for “insufficient coherence with the relevant organizations” despite being given rare video permits.
According to Felim Kine, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokowi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists trying to report from rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are now facing new dangers: visa waivers and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir dismissed the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, local residents broke the silence, asking: “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold new presidential elections in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokovi again.
“Jokowi is a man with good intentions but surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are immersed in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobay says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their voice given to Jokovi a duty that he must pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military site.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire covers the Dubai skyscraper “Torch” for the second time
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of a seventy-nine-story structure 337 meters high.
This is the second fire that has swept through a high-rise building – which coincidentally is called “The Torch” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news on the cause of the fire.
“We were asleep and woke up from the fire alarms and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a resident of a skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Authority, firefighters extinguished the fire at about 4:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident could put the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
During the investigation by the Torch administration after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected is the coating - external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation system and plating panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could have accelerated the spread of a fire there in June that killed about 80 people.
The growth of the tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data obtained by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign tourists - increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists increased the most in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malakhov made it clear to fans who are to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who are guilty of his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of an article in the Vedomosti newspaper for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milksucker".
Article on how to prevent the "burnout" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you remember the numerous reports that the presenter could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at.
As reported, TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on leave and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First channel.
The situation with the dismissal may become clear in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in the explosion of a car
At least five soldiers were killed in the explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, RIA Novosti reported.
According to police, the night before near the checkpoint of the military in the district of Girishk exploded a mined car.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girishka there was a new emergency.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange.
The firefight between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver filmed a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured on video a shark that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn portal said.
The man, while diving, tried to take the shark to the camera, which he held on a special stick.
When he saw the man, the animal, more than three meters long, swam to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in a similar way to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal turned out to be a novelty for scientists.
The cause of the mass fighting in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Elan training center, where the mass fighting took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this beating have already been made known.
According to the public Mash, which appeared on the page "VKontakte", contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought fiercely because of the unfilled bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer's order to fill the sticking sheet.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young boys smashed beds and sinks in the barracks, knocked out glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fighting.
In the CWO denied the information about the slash.
The study found that at least one-fifth of U.S. passengers carry prohibited items on board.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the plane through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration’s checkpoints, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane without having a prohibited knife or other sharp object with them.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later found that they had accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people, also found that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously passing ATB employees most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted to carrying spicy objects through the inspection, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying prohibited drugs onto the plane.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through airport screening, and how many were doing so consciously.
It is quite expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - those who fly the most are smuggled through the inspection.
As the company points out, ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what amount.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that the ATB might consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA chief Pruitt refuses to delay Obama’s emissions reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted under Obama, designed to reduce emissions of substances that pollute the air and lead to the formation of smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that his agency is now more than under previous administrations, listening to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention a lawsuit against his previous position filed in a federal appeals court.
The dispute unfolded around the October 1 deadline, to which the states must ensure compliance with 2015 standards for ozone at ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone compliance by one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistencies with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before being appointed by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of norms that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewtt to return to the old norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by drastically changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s duty to cooperate with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Under previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet its deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed timelines in the course of settling the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
“We do not believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our charter and the authority it gives us.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could at some point again use his “deferral powers and other powers given by law” to make sure that the rules “jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader revision of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay compliance with 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states filing a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal pressure.
“The change in the EPA’s course – following our lawsuits – is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington D.C. joined the lawsuit.
Ground-level ozone occurs when ordinary pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries and chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed the sudden change in Pruitt’s course.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from the person charged with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Anne Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
The IAAF Congress extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
Thus, Congress supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in force.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 people voted against it, TASS reports.
The IAAF Board report stated that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Renewal Board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The VFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
A report by the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which referred to numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.

Injurious defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Russian Fonbet Championship among the PFL teams, the Novomoskovsky Chemist played a away match against FC Kaluga.
Just over 10 days ago, the rivals played among themselves in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" in nothing inferior to the opponent, but a second of relaxation at the end of the match led to an insulting goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat from the Kaluzans with a score of 0:3, many predicted in advance the easy victory of the owners.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovskys were forced to consider themselves and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the pupils built more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous strikes and his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemist" did not have enough effort and luck to put an impasse defense "Kalugi" and score the first goal on the road.
After the break, the game began to take place on counter courses.
The Novomoskovskys were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team were errors in the defense, which allowed the Kaluzhans to create a number of acute moments.
10 minutes before the end of the meeting, the “Chemist” intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluzans played a role - they more competently and coolly spent the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the "Chemist" moved the ball to the corner, the feed of which the owners of the field without resistance were transferred to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" showed a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
In front of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Eduard Streltsov Novomoskovsky will fight against the favorite group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexei Rebko.
Come and support the chemist!
The meeting place and time of the Novomoskovtsev - 18:30 near the Magnolia shop (Eastern, D.2, corp.
Composition of "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudayti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of telephone conversations, trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post has published transcripts of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The president of the United States scolded him for publicly speaking out against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him: “You can’t tell the press.”
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the U.S. southern border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated quarrel.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous”, “disgusting” and “stupid”, and insisted that because of the agreement the Obama administration made, he would look like an idiot because he intended to stop the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
The bodies of the killed in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the place of the final point of departure, the board will be met by employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city hall, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia, took over the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the victims compensation in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay the relatives of the victims of the explosions of tourists flight and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of rocket and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to be detonated.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens were killed - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the Republic.
Currently, seven people remain in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
The study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be carried out by a large jury
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller convened a grand jury in Washington, which will study the influence of Russia on the election of the President of the United States in 2016, according to the newspaper The Wall Street Journal and Reuters.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting then Donald Trump's presidential candidate with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, held in June 2016, previously promised and Mueller himself.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump, Jr. previously said that from a meeting with Veselnitskaya, he expected a compromise on the headquarters of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, but no exposing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr..
The White House said that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice Mayor Penza detained in the workplace
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on this matter have not yet been received, but the press service of the SC assured that they will soon follow.
In the city hall Penza has not yet commented on what happened.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has supervised urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the Department of State Construction and Inspection in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there are no cosmodromes or launch vehicles in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who went to space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet."
In 2012, the monument was erected in Houston, U.S.A., near NASA’s former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) avoided demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin’s 70th anniversary, a monument to Yurius Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the name of the first astronaut sounds in Latvian, and he looks like he turned 70 years old.
Morse Ford Murder: Activists Will Lose Lynch's Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
"Ford Mercury" in 1948 drove past the audience in the village of Monroe in Georgia and rushed with a roar to the small bridge Morse Ford.
As the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its way.
The main - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin strip - pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man cried.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing cries broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Thankfully, this horrible scene that took place on July 22nd is just a staging.
But when "Roger" was put on the neck of a loop, almost all the viewers really held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to replay the night the Kuklux Klans lynched two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey – in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that no people have been arrested in all these years — even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and it's a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former member of the Georgia Congress who has fought for human rights his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until justice is done.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the lynching victims at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of two lynchmen’s motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote on the primaries that were due to take place that summer.
Around the same election, the FBI reported, black gunman Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that Hester was rumored to have slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was about to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they were driving out of prison and approaching the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of brigands surrounded the car.
“It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders Harrison,” – such conclusion is made in one of the FBI reports.
“It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on voting rights,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a signal to the blacks in town: if you sign up and vote, it will be the same with you.”
For almost a decade, Cassandra Greene has been leading the annual lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is spectacular, captivating the audience and telling the story of that deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It’s hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green thinks that’s what matters.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals for this year's play began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to the polished over the years review of the play.
Wade Marbo was a director with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role has not become easier.
“I think I got dirty because that’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, enraged that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Screaming Rascon in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is whining.
Greene laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" asked Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overreacting?
"No," Green said, laughing.
"I just don't think white people said 'nigga' back then."
"Yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You have to make a solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the memory of four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says a word with the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends abruptly and quickly.
Shooting, screaming, and then silence.
A woman in mournful black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billy Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
In a hundred yards from it, half a hundred spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
Among the viewers almost equal number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to see the show; many live right next door.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for almost eight hours as Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and Dorsey.
Until that point, the murders were just a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynching, it seems that their ghosts are floating in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children tilt to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy murmurs, as if to remind himself of it.
After a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly everything is over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
“It’s okay,” one woman whispered.
“We know your heart is good.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta discusses a play with a black couple they just met.
Denise Daplinski struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynching is still going on,” she adds, “only now it’s called police shooting.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights defender, got the general attention.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“The staging inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve been through, but it also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.
The court fined Navalny for violations on the “agitation Saturday”
The Simonovsky court in Moscow fined Alexei Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offense provided for in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organizing a rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakaev, completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the agit materials, the police officers followed the participants of the Saturday believed that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to seek prior permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev petitioned for the termination of administrative proceedings due to the lack of composition of the offense and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in drawing up the protocol.
At the very "agitation Saturday" Volkov was not detained, but he received a subpoena obliging him to appear in the police department for a story about the event held with his active participation.
The same agendas were received by Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition leader - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested the shooter of the bride and three guests of the wedding
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican Directorate of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event, who came to the rural pond to bathe.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been opened under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to kill two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous way, for hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the guests of the wedding, having decided to bathe, passed through the territory of his section to the pond.
The Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil pumping facilities and oil production equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution is already ready and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critical energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
The potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign special services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
EU extends anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The press service of the European Union said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions were expanded due to the scandal over the supply of turbines manufactured by Siemens to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by “Arguments of the Week”.
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against Russia have been expanded due to the scandal with the turbines manufactured by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea in circumvention of the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member countries to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be taken before the end of the current day, and the decision was made, sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, Pearson, a British education group, announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of pre-dividends by 72 percent in connection with the start of another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges their businesses face.
These job cuts, which, according to company CEO John Fallon, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to the 4,000 jobs that were cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson said it plans to cut spending by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May during its third cost-cutting program to try to bring back the business hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1% increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan’s capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh urban area.
The blast is the latest in a bloodbath in Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night’s explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a “man-portable homemade explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receive treatment at the American military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Reporters report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them were in the capital.
In late July, a suicide bombing in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out by them.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the center of the city killed more than 150 people - the most serious terrorist attack in the country since the United States-led forces removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is assessing whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to reporters, the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public trust in the government, its line of conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has canceled a decision to delay the passage of the Obama-era law, which requires states to limit emissions that pollute the air, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “ozone measurements 2015”, stressing that the move shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our partners in the states,” said Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to postpone measurements of ozone, where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air purity standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, together with the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations, concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that using ozone-containing air for breathing “may impair lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The Association of European Businesses has expressed its disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to AEB, such measures can lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
Business is one of the important links between countries and people, so you can’t limit the principles of free trade.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow to separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
MPs ask police to restrict traffic on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people’s elected representatives sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement on the embankment of the Great River.
The deputies of the City Duma Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Partynikov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of drivers will help to make this territory more calm and safe.
The problem is that the intruders ignore the signs "Walkway" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable due to cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central embankment is patrolled by PPS motor patrol officers and militiamen.
Thanks to them, the number of cars passing by becomes smaller, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin urges investigators not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to ban investigative authorities from removing servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to exclude the use of measures leading to the suspension of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers, in the interests of the investigation.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, assure them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the company's activities until the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with work issues.
Just the day before Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She said she didn’t get married, didn’t get any new tattoos, and didn’t call her ex-wife, saying he ruined her life, even though she really wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the film adaptation of the series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper “Independant” on Thursday.
About the death of the actor told his relatives.
According to them, he lived a “huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television in 70 years of his career.”
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played alongside Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy is also remembered for his repeated performance of the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of the adaptations of Agatha Christie's works about Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Motion Picture and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy has also played the role of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Labord, refused to be buried along with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the company has a "golden" wedding, but the couple's agenda is not preparations for the celebrations, but a grave dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and he said to the Queen that she had never given him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains the Queen's official wife.
Russian Foreign Ministry urges Washington to stop robbing Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop robbing Russia.
As “Arguments of the Week” wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seem to be steadily moving to hold the most exciting boxing match under 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s second-half champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories Erian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of the weight category.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champ?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko’s manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a potential decisive battle between them would be just right.
“I used to be half-light,” Garcia recalled.
“I climbed the category for Broner [up to <0xC2><0xA3>140], but I’m not that big.
I'm not good enough for 140.
I want to go down to the lungs.
And he needs to climb to the semi-lung [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
“The boxer needs this fight.”
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy he pursues for Lomachenko to hold his debut fight in the 135 weight later this year to schedule next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linarez and Lubel Veszle.
“The fight could be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer better financial terms.
“We are the main names.
No other names will cause such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a “stunning boxer” and may visit his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the champion in three weights from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you were begging for a knockout".
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing before their own fight.
“This fight must take place.
No other fight causes so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will block the traffic for the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, traffic will be limited in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasyinsky Lane to Triumphalna Square, as well as traffic on the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningradsky Prospect, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In all areas, the overlap will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend will be closed traffic on the section of the Moskvoretskaya embankment.
There continues the construction of the park "Zaryadye".
Putin ordered the Prosecutor General’s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Prosecutor General’s Office to check the Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” Vladimir Putin said at a meeting devoted to the environmental development of the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of violations are revealed.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were evaluated as persons over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed they were minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as people 18 years of age or older, and for another 25 cases, the forensics agency estimated that the test subject was “probably a person 18 years of age or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person raises doubts.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference with the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases on which people were judged to be over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, "most likely, the age of the tested 18 years or more."
However, after reviewing 581 published results, Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that he turned 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making an X-ray of wisdom teeth and a tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, also drew criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institutet, Claude Marcus, part of whose work is to evaluate the biological maturity of people in order to determine whether they have passed through puberty earlier or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think you should use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus very inaccurate.
If we can’t define it with confidence, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, Göranssen of the forensics agency spoke in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, we can say that the risk of mistakenly accepting a child as an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is soon 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I will consider whether to run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether to run for the post of President of Russia in the elections in 2018, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to the request of residents of the village of Cheremushki of the Buryat region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and the Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be held, we all ask you to run again for this post."
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "on nothing based, hypothetical reasoning".
"So far there are no headquarters, before the establishment of headquarters is far, before the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
“This is not on the agenda yet,” Peskov said.
West Virginia Governor Says He's Moving to Another Party
The governor of West Virginia, Democratic Party representative Jim Justice announced on Thursday during a rally with President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” Justice said.
"Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a democratic governor."
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement will be made at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes, is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening that “Governor Justice’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is rather hindering than working to make our country great again.”
“Given just 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justice’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
A cat named Mr. Krasavchyk found a home thanks to social networks
A cattery in Pittsborough (North Carolina, USA) built a cat named Mr. Beautiful weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat was posted on Facebook asking to find its owner, because "he was obviously fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the muzzle of the animal can become a new meme.
The publication received more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed a desire to shelter Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now he weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users paid attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long legs.
The post with a photo of the animal collected more than 68,000 views.
Commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised the “sincere” apology of Russia in connection with the doping scandal
International athletics specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian representative of the Athletics Federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin told the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which was held on the eve of the World Championships in athletics, that the suspension of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologised to "all athletes who have been robbed of gold and silver medals in competitions."
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence of the use of state-funded doping.
“I thought today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
“The whole council and the whole congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Coe said he also “liked” that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission, according to which now is not the time to restore Russia in rights,” he said.
“Over the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations Rune Andersen said on Monday that for the restoration of Russia has yet to meet a number of requirements.
As he told reporters in London after a report on the board of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out enough, and suspended coaches are still calmly doing their job.
Court arrests Ukrainian journalist suspected of treason
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) journalist Vasily Muravitsky sent to arrest for two months, reports the SBU.
An employee of the online publication "Journal of Zhytomyr" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and infringing on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to conduct a limited military operation in the Mediterranean Sea.
The patrol ship "Komandante Borsini" entered the territorial waters of Libya, then together with the Navy of the country to stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country.
The opposing cabinet and the Tobruk-based Libyan parliament have accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army Field Marshal Haftar gave his subordinates the order to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another military vessel to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at the talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Sarraj.
Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on the number of illegal migrants entering the country from Libya were released in July: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants are exhausted.

Two leaders of the national team of Ukraine in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short distance running, were excluded from the Ukrainian national team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the Executive Committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) against women athletes.
Coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko was also expelled from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects female athletes of doping.
Povh - bronze medalist of the Olympics-2012 and the world championship-2011, the champion of Europe-2010 in the relay of 4 by 100 meters, Zemlyak - the winner of the European championship of 2012 in the relay of 4 by 400 meters.
The World Championships in Athletics will be held in London from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect the move of Neymar to Paris
The rules, aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs, will not prevent the world-record-setting transfer of Neymar from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of the financial fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG could certainly go on a spree to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that went into huge debt in their pursuit of success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on clubs’ debts and switched instead to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – has become a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs can suffer losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini’s shameful removal from office in 2015, his successor in UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to deter excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive and we are going to tighten the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for Neymar’s contract buyout at one time, he can distribute this amount for the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on PSG, as well as on Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (US$82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and ordered to limit its squad to 21 players over the 2014–1015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspections by inflating their revenues at the expense of companies affiliated with club owners.
Although the Qatari company could sponsor PSG, but if the amount of funding was found to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG by the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be an ambassador for the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more careful to monitor any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday, people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They communicated with the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, sales of attributes and T-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club assumes that the turnover will increase by at least 30 percent due to the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would violate the financial "Fair Play".
“This is an obvious case of ‘financial doping,’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
“These are all the consequences of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to follow the financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath will be determined by the President.
Where and how the new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for taking the oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age, as well as those incapacitated, will be exempted from the solemn oath, follows from the amended text of amendments to the draft law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (there is "Izvestia"), which the committee will consider before the second reading at its meeting on July 11.
The idea of introducing an oath when entering Russian citizenship instead of formal signing of documents, President Vladimir Putin supported on June 6 during a meeting with the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies of the Russian Federation issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the abolition of the decision on granting citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of Article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of a train or a train.
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian legislation - having embarked on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The draft law was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Building and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", specifying that the ceremony should be held in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be the squirrels.
To make a solemn oath wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after the officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after taking the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, and not from 14.
There is a rule that the incapacitated or limited incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and “other persons”,
Also, the updated bill prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine, who are considered native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship, submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
The renunciation of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the person’s control”.
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among which the first vice-speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Building and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have writtenly renounced the "other" citizenship and handed over the previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in the municipal service, to be employed at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country may not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically recalls both the glorious days of the characters in the '80s; the grunge era in the '90s (about the time that the outstanding masters David Wayne and Michael Shawlter made the "State" sketch comedy for MTV); and themselves - that is, about 2001, before her stars, like Elizabeth Poehler and Elizabeth Poehler.
As a fact of culture, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems an anachronism.
"The First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not only because of the absurd humor (including the original story of the talking pot of vegetables, voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood; thus, the inability to return to becoming part of the joke.
“Ten Years Later,” where adults have played already adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker films of the 90s like “Hands rocking the cradle.”
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and “a bunch of other things from 1991.”
Many plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not parted with his virginity.
And then there is the insane and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also called Showalter), who is now instigated by George Bush Sr. (a tried-and-tested parody performed by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the retreat from it.
Especially fun to see the eternally young Rudd, who sings the song of Matt Dillon from "Lonely Ones", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old.
This franchise could be a success of random insanity in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movie premiere of the film "Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon turns to another type of nostalgia: the memories of the Cold War from "Americans", "Explosive Blonde" or even "Flash" with her images of the struggle of the East and the West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: a 1980s Romanian police drama about two Bucharest policemen fighting for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelia Ulich, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Channing Tatum (aka executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
It's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a chess match as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play interesting "guess the voice".
But Comrade Detective is so attached to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama — there’s even a killer in Ronald Reagan’s mask — that it often looks like.
Six long episodes are lengthy, and funny happens not very often.
If it were made shorter, Comrade Detective could better cope with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat men are sitting in the lobby, absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist spectator, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making anything fat.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: We do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia in football between "Spartacus" and "Locomotive" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergei Pryadkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there are almost no tickets left for the match so far.
The match "Spartak" - "Locomotive" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As noted by TASS, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufa cleaned up the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, the police contacted a 37-year-old Ufimian, who has a furniture company.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to its production.
Mining thieves were tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a puncher, hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of order began to search for the criminals and soon came out to the residents of Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, hacked the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment the first caught car service.
A theft case has already been opened against them, and law enforcement officers have managed to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
State Department commented on the words of Medvedev on the relations between the Russian Federation and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev on the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to hopes of improving bilateral relations and declared Russia a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a “low level”, but noted that it is necessary to look for “areas for interaction”.
“Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign Ministry refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions are tantamount to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
However, he admitted that the document was a failure and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
In them appeared five new rings and three necklace-choker on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line has released two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of glyphics (hand-carved stone) and pavement and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of the Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that designer Christian Dior had grown on his estate in Granville, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatel and Pre-Catellan.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has made a sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, the same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House circulated a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Viktor Prokopenya, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to "focus on our other planned investments and projects that we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step will be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of a Russian bank in Ukraine after in July the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutzeriev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of such financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
In the Ministry of energy of the Russian Federation called the reason for the blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck involved in the accident hit the power transmission lines, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were disconnected.
Disruptions in the power supply of large Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists corrected the problem within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of blackout may have been an abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have made rumors of a possible rise subside.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish, and left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressures on family incomes.
Specialists of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with a smaller number of committee members this month opting for a rate hike because weak economic growth weakened support for the hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a 1.7% increase in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.
Also, the members of the committee voted to abandon part of the huge set of measures for the development of the economy, launched a year ago due to Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close the emergency financing plan, which provides banks with cheap loans, although he said that he now has to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion - up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
According to the MPC’s main forecasts, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation, it would require “some tightening of financial policy” in a “slightly larger” amount than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for this year and next are lower than forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank remained unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 USD and by 0.4% to 1.11 EUR.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth figures weakened expectations of an increase; GDP then rose 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, the growth appears to remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank’s latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases: according to the Bank, the pressure will intensify before it goes down.
The bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” has been successful in earnings in the next few years, but expects wages to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for growth as a result of growing demand for British goods, driven by a low pound rate that offsets part of lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its last decision on rates, there was an increase in noise around the alleged rate hike, as inflation increasingly pressured the already under pressure households: three members of the committee of specialists asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and is offset again in the coming months.
According to the bank, a higher figure compared to the planned 2% is completely due to the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Koreko Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good end to the year.
The market looks particularly favorable to those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as with a low rate, becomes more popular than ever.
Public health service to prescribe controversial drug against HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court over the issue of funding the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk individuals by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for an initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that claimed the National Health Service had the ability to pay for PrEP despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was called a “major innovation” by National Health Service President Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Agency (NAT) called it a “turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to receive the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The clinics will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international procurement tender signed a drug supply contract.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of PrEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and intensify large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT, said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening up tool, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing to do now is to make sure that the trial is rapidly rolled out across the country and that no one at risk for HIV is forgotten.
“Now that we are provided with the experimental drug PrEP, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays from the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and to move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on support for the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively proven form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole.”
The agreement in force since July 24, 2007 between Moscow and Kazan was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and keep the name of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "President".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units are deficient in international driving licences (IDCs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on vacation abroad with their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licenses remains controversial.
The MIA was introduced in order to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements of international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require MIA, and some have enough national rights.
In order to be insured, drivers still receive international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or MIA.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all traffic police units, Kommersant reports, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of the traffic police, cards are simply not issued, forms are missing for four months.
You can make an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain the MIA "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation develops in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
That's right, because all the traffic police departments have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international law very quickly.
In Moscow, all the time it is driven far ahead, on the spot the coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupon can not give).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in the SPb free time to fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, so the department of the State Autoinspection is the delivery of new forms.
This may be related to the deficit, however, it is not clear what changes are in question, this has not been previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purposes in the Field of Road Safety (CSN ODD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand forms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First Printed Yard" for the manufacture of 70 thousand forms.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender in time, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: due to the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, to the end is not clear, so people are re-insured, and therefore there was an exuberant demand for international "crusts".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
The Ministry of Transport made such a proposal.
The new International Driving Permit (IDP) has been valid since May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine Pavel Petrenko said that he does not believe in the ability of Russia to build a bridge to the Crimea.
About this on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal “Observer”.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia on the Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects for this project actually do not exist," - said Petrenko.
He added that he believes that Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, entire stadiums have already begun to crumble.
"Therefore, I believe the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be so short-sighted to join this project," the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the comprehensive assembly of the road arch of the Crimean bridge has been completed: its arch is closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared for the installation of a railway arch on the fairway supports," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the object is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
In Spain, fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official Carles Recio have?
The permanent break stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Recio was nevertheless dismissed.
But not his immediate boss.
What happens in the world of bureaucrats?
The inhabitants seem to have long been accustomed to all the jokes of the “servants of the people”.
And yet, officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, a member of the archives of Valencia, Carles Recio, managed to avoid going to work for ten years.
He was regularly paid.
And all the solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
Mr. Recio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by the legislature of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that an angry walker came to the office every working morning at 07:00 to mark himself in the electronic system.
And immediately went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 4:00 p.m. to again mark in the system that he had left.
And so 10 years.
It also became known that the walker devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
The deputies of the Valencian legislature are now thinking how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate superior, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace.
Judges offer protection from presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of power.
The HRC proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The Human Rights Council has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the Human Rights Council on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with members of the Council.
At a meeting with the members of the Council on December 8, 2016, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness were discussed, as well as problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens (see "Kommersant" of December 9, 2016).
As a result of the work of the HRC, 25 proposals were made, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin’s human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the HRC, must submit him for appointment, not having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases among judges.
This, experts admit, can be a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRC believes that the chairman has no right to "predetermine the results of the qualification attestation of the judge, initiate his bringing to disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the “election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves” and “to give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation”.
Now all the presidents of courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to shield judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes to reorganize appeals and cassations in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts take the practice of arbitration courts as a basis.
There are “court districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee greater independence from regional officials who have difficulty using the “telephone right”.
The Human Rights Council proposes to strengthen the people’s jurors in order to deal with certain “categories of civil and administrative cases”.
For example, about deprivation of parental rights, about recovery at work, about protection of honor and dignity, about deprivation of a driver's license, etc.
“These are just our proposals,” explained the “Kommersant” member of the Human Rights Council, retired Constitutional Court judge Tamara Morshchakov.
She also recalled that the President's order was not only for the HRC, but also for the Supreme Court (SJ), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the execution of the order with the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must by September 1.
Living a high life: the semi-floor and cunning design techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious home in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a pretty Queen Anne-style house, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not pack her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger area,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.”
Since the first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio “Duck & Shed” to use ceilings 12.5 feet high and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would fit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where one could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and did not have to bend.
It was necessary not only to build a simple platform, but also to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms one above the other in the allocated space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" overlooks the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serge Mui set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space, and light.
A short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel appears as a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like in a garage.
"Engineering art was involved here," Erfan will tell about the reinforced steel of the wood-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Due to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“After all, floor space is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will enter and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help build an emotional connection with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t touch the strings of our hearts.”
This is a testament to the fact that due to a good design and an increased meter, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
Government Approves Establishment of Cultural Policy Commission
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the Commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
The Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation has been appointed as the head of the Commission.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2016 approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, as well as to help create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation drops to eight-year low
The rise in consumer prices in the G20 countries has fallen to the lowest in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% - lower values were recorded in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first one-week deflation in 2017.
The target of inflation in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal demolition of the Baikal taiga
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned during a meeting on the ecological development of the natural Baikal territory against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during the eradication of fires, and the government plans to adopt it as early as autumn.
In turn, the President said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of logging "not everything is cut down in a row."
Donskoy noted that this bill assumes control by the Emergencies Ministry and supervisory agencies.
Media: Ukrainian soldiers secretly from the command negotiate with Donbas militias
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass established regular telephone communication.
Fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the militias of Donbass established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues from the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not domestic at all: the commanders are trying to reach some “tactical agreements”.
Often, as a result of such talks, there is a truce at a certain part of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when an officer received congratulations on his birthday because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and militias of the DPR and LPR have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against the Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry was outraged by the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council about the attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorists of the groups “Heyat Tahrir al-Sham” (formerly “Jabhat al-Nusra”, banned in the Russian Federation) and “Failak al-Rahman”.
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualified Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the resolutions of the UN Security Council call for counteraction to this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the Nusra attacks should meet universal unconditional and resolute condemnation, and in the assessment of the duality against diplomatic missions there should be no duplicity."
However, for the third time in a month, diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, covering up arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard short draft statement of the Security Council to the press condemning terrorist attacks on its diplomatic mission.
Let the reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the conscience of these delegations.
“The most outrageous thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity,” the Foreign Ministry said, adding that “I would not want these barbarians to have the belief that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of unscheduled business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that the period of inspections should be limited to ten days.
"Unplanned inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, everything else goes on its own," the president said.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring some positive to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "Kommersant", due to the moratorium on scheduled inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, a survey was conducted, as a result of which it turned out that in fact there was a replacement of planned inspections by unscheduled (the share of those confronted with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21.8%), citizens (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as the inspection (from 7.9% to 13.3%).

Brothers fight for real estate empire worth more than $500 million
The two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million - forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carleton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lütis lives in Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to get out of the family business from 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money has been invested in real estate, and the list of De Lutes family properties today includes office buildings, building plots in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under an arrangement with his late father Colin - whom Paul describes as "the main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Luthis family - he owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets.
According to the court, this means that Colin's property is 316 million and Paul's is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court were held.
The brothers now argue about who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the testimony Colin gave at the start of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority,” he wrote.
Court costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails, and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer have both attracted the most prominent lawyers, including royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best raccoons.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was “in the last grades of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) at the time.”
Anna De Lütis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to transfer their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that she doesn’t want the brothers to get into court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutes group of companies; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he left the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their separation.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGee, the best friend of the TV star.
On Friday, Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied, in a text message that said that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, “I really have nothing to say.”
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and shout the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a statement that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
“Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court,” he said, adding that he was “still hoping for a resolution to the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
“The decision on our case will soon be made by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Perhaps John F. Kelly will succeed.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, hoping to keep the chief in a calmer state.
This is what reporter Josh Dawsey said.
“At a meeting held by the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, with the White House chief of staff on his first working day, he outlined a major problem at the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to address: poor channels of information to the president.”
Kelly told employees that the information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is quite correct, but others have already failed in trying to appease Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump’s relationship with television developed decades ago — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was receiving fair coverage in publications that could be reassured,” Sam Nanberg, a former campaign advisor, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmieri wrote in Politico at the time that “six former campaign staff members said that in order to control Trump’s habit of tweeting, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise in the information that was coming to him personally.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting was ever “under control” is just ridiculous.
Maybe these members of the campaign know something we don’t know – for example, that if it weren’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about tweets that Trump didn’t post.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one ever managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda by providing Trump with material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
Politico - just to this story - wrote in May about the inclination of advisers to constantly give the president dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Trump's current and former employees say that Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous information leaks, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone pushed the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus, Katie Welsh, was accused of being “behind a number of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is banned forever on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he hasn’t presented specific facts, or that in the past he has launched false accusations and then dropped them.
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Welsh.”
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the apparatus, Raines Priebus, and the secretary of the apparatus, Rob Porter, “tried to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump is still impulsive and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor’s office fights HIV-dissident
The prosecutor’s office challenged the decision of the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident, who died of HIV a young daughter.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecution believes that the crime should not be left unpunished, so as not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection in the 4th stage.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman was not treated on her own and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case came to the Kalinin district court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "forgived his wife, has no complaints to her, she smoothed out the harm and apologized."
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be annulled and sent to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it is impossible to compensate for the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the press service of the prosecutor's office said.
According to the supervisory authority, it should be punished, otherwise it will be followed by other HIV dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to conduct a diagnosis, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokesman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV-dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia’s first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and see their spread as a serious threat.
A terrible photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the railway station Grechany in Khmelnitsky.
The cheerful company of drunken young people walked over the bridge over the railway tracks, where just stood the freight train.
One of the friends had the idea to make a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported “FACTAM” in the sector of police communication in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his carelessness he caught the power line and immediately received a shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station's dispatcher, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of Khmelnitsky regional clinical hospital.
The man was diagnosed with torso burns of 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>2 degrees.
Now his condition is assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officers remind that in recent times, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, moving transport are becoming increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and to prevent such photo shoots, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists have allowed the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This is the assumption made by French scientists.
Scientists have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that Venus at the beginning of its history formed oceans, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Shooting in San Francisco Park Injures Three People
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, reports the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where there were a significant number of visitors.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began to shout threats.
One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, as they had closed everything except their eyes.
Another was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third injured person is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular destination among locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while attempting to leave the room.
Rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will be held in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album “Wonderful New World”, which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The team is preparing a conceptual show that will become the brightest in the concert history of the group.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the well-known novel-antiutopia O. Huxley "O wonderful new world".
The new songs do not retold the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values."
To raise money for the recording of the album, the group was helped by listeners: on the website "Planet.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album “Make It Louder!” in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
The band includes Lucine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratyev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will be held at the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Devil's Dozen".
The gypsies crossed the trench and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in West Midland are once again in conflict with resolute Gypsies, who have overcome a ditch dug by municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the wealthy Solihalla Street, nicknamed “Millionaires Street.”
Bringing with them horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being driven no further than in May, and they were not prevented by a ditch dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed its vehicles through a section left unfenced to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it was “unable to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on Monday evening after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passersby.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and here they are again.
Last night, there were more Gypsies, and today, perhaps more.
“The municipality of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they are getting long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don’t like that I keep paying the municipal tax and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
A local resident who wished to remain anonymous said, “It’s funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave the previous time, and please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.”
A spokesman for the municipality of Solihull said: “We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
To help us gather evidence, it’s important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This allows us to form an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the plant of champagne wines "New Light"
The State Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "Champagne Wine Plant "New World" decided to take action, transforming into OJSC "Champagne Wine Plant "New World", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of the Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the shares of the company will remain in the state ownership of the Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will amount to 595,5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the plant, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The use of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting borrowed funds from large credit institutions," Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament has included the company in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its shareholding and put it up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investment of the investor in modernization - another $ 30 million.
New Light in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World was going to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lviv Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in the property of Nowy Svet purchased by him.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders crushed more than 40 gravestones
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region have identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknowns was received by the Russian OMVD in the Lyskov district on June 27.
In total, 24 people contacted the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites" was initiated.
According to the results of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, and this prompted them to act as a hooligan.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone against NGO ships that rescue migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin-based daily Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a vessel belonging to the German humanitarian organization “Jugend Rettet” on suspicion that its crew actually cooperates with human traffickers and facilitates illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which worked for only a year, declined to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against her by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone right now,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now after we have gathered all the information and been able to assess the situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus vessel, owned by the Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board whole lifeboats of migrants, who were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave along with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the content of which was published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the Italian coastal authorities’ regulations, which control rescue operations in the area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct assumes, mainly, that Juventa-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa Open Embraces” from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considers the new rules unnecessary but acceptable, provided they do not entail any "significant changes or disruptions" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to be associated with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have been frequented with visits to Moscow.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told “Kommersant” what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and who it is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the Libya contact group you are heading.
Here, say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of secrecy.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "Kommersant").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the formation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board.
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it happen that you were the one to lead her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the work of the group.
Our activities were not limited to the release of sailors from the Chebotarev Mechanics.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict, both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based) and from Tobruk (the seat of parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Kommersant"), we managed to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to create a contact group in order to make more effective use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
In Libya, we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are currently five people in the contact group.
Among them there are people who have experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include representatives of the Middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the group of specialists for the region.
There is no permanent presence of our staff in Libya, which is not yet necessary.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities like Misurata (where militias are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years).
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, they said that there are Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of Islamists in there.
In Misrata we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic state" - "Kommersant").
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, check the information that they played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed himself to these merits.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Didn’t the Islamic State in Libya win Haftar?
He didn't do it.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, Benghazi.
And with ISIS in Sirte fought the structures subordinated to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited the people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, go to all the Libyan regions and probably imagine the mood of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached at the end of July in Paris?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, agreements will be broken, fighting will resume, the parties will try to take power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, the two leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You must be very brave people to come to us today.”
But our task is precisely to show that we do not only support Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar spoke.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR facilitates mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
Russian, if he knows it, is very relative.
But the fact that he learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And not just with him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak beautifully Russian.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they are nostalgic for it.
Do you think it is likely that the arms embargo imposed on Libya will be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and do not want to arm one at the expense of the other.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow contribute to its lifting.
In Libya, the process of drafting a constitution is being actively promoted.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and achieve an internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, as was also said at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate power is finally elected (and now neither side has such status), then it is possible to raise the issue of lifting the arms embargo in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue is now pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees sailing from Libya, feels abandoned by the fate of the allies of the EU.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is the possibility that Haftar’s troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers smuggling immigrants to Europe?
Very timely question.
We are actively working on it.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misurata and the south.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the fact that the South stops the flow of migrants in the long run?
That is, conditionally speaking, turned back the buses, which are traveling Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to contribute to uniting the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the South.
But first, we would like to see unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical are his views?
Will this be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
Islamists are in the coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be a completely normal country – moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
How did he get such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where the legislative, executive and judicial powers are located.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not to climb there.
And we mixed all the cards with them and began to actively communicate with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
NOC Director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft’s head Igor Sechin made the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil by Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll resell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
They are planning to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, we are talking about the scheme of "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not deal directly with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacekeeping work there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and that Libya ceases to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task – to help the Libyan people and push out the terrorists.
Do you have information about the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date, there are no natives from Russia and other countries of the former USSR there.
He said he has about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - "Kommersant") and Russian speech does not sound there.
What countries are these militants from?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many Islamic militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are almost no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are incoming.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are in active negotiations with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still several visits to be made, and then, hopefully, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chekhov museum, philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow-based museum-reservoir "Melichovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive a specialized treadmill.
A useful presentation will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the simulator was collected during the charity marathon "Do not get tired of doing good", which was held in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov Memorial Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov district: "I do not see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d really like to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs are strong and I could learn to walk a little bit.”
And then Sasha's dream came true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the choir of the Ascension Davyd Desert, the bells of Ilya Drozdikhin's workshop, students of the Tchaikovsky Moscow Conservatory and the Gnesin Russian Academy, artists of the Melikhov Theatre "Chekhov Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhovo Museum-Reserve took the initiative to make Chekhov Memorial Day on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was annoyed by the noise, reported “FACTAM” in the police department of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe nearby.
In the building, he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by that time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's seized a device to shoot rubber bullets, which was sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
We will remind, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with shooting.
Michelle Carter's Sentences for Reports That Caused Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months behind bars and another five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at a hearing on Thursday: “My family is grieving.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, squeezing her hands and lowering her eyes.
“She killed Conrad Roy with her actions,” the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse."
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said he believed her "age, maturity level or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions."
The prosecutor read out Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, saying: “There hasn’t been a day that I haven’t mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I handle it - I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever."
Roy's sister, Camdin Roy, said she was relentlessly haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“Leaving the person who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case is likely to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that provides responsibility for counseling a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter’s message.
“You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don’t know a lot of ways,” she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and forbade her to communicate with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on this.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British flatmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old wrote in the Los Angeles Times, “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison.”
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB Single League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNICS.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the President of UNIX Evgeny Bogachev.
Keith made this decision due to family circumstances, - Evgeny Bogachev said.
He has a small child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different attitude.
He played at UNICS for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, bet on all 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the Unified League-2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award of the most effective player of the Euroleague season.
He scored an average of 21.75 points per game.
This is the second result since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to win the prize more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese “Shenzhen”, informs Eurohops.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second EuroLeague star to enter the Chinese championship in July.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panathinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
A sunburned tourist from the Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygean rescuers today evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous region of the republic of the Moscow region tourist, who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased blood pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who said that the man received burns during the campaign.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Vehicles
A day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would offer to update the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The chairman of BMW said the company believes “there are smarter ways than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a retraction.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that discard diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust of diesel cars is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of indulging influential automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of the so-called “defeat devices”, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and in the conditions of ordinary driving were turned off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, while the rest are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department as part of the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacceo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which was previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of the income of Volkswagen.
In Astrakhan, a cafe visitor paid off with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery of the recalculation of funds received from the point of general catering, a suspicious note with a face value of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert-Criminalist Center found that it was fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the cafe, who bought shawarma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, police officers are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a knowingly fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of the Astrakhan region to be attentive when carrying out financial transactions; employees of trade objects are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the received funds.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet on which even iron can melt
After studying for the first time the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts noted that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located ten times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earthly" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender began to grow worse due to dry weather and disease-carrying insects; this caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: there has been much less rainfall in the spring and especially in the fall.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very much.
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is very popular in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, “Instead of very long ears with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts that contain essential oil.”
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in hockey, Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met the day before with novice hockey players and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to hockey with a puck.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with the drawing of souvenirs of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation were organized.
Fifty students participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the children to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to engage in hockey.
“It is good that there is such a platform in Krasnoyarsk as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyars.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 Directorate reports.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said about the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation."
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the agreement on Syria on a truce.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” she said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said this, then it has the right to say, but I can’t say anything more about it,” the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, putting an end to hopes of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would be in place for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment “cleanly beat” Trump.
Missing in the Moscow region bodybuilder found in someone else's cottage lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very piquant circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully searched by acquaintances and local residents.
And Shamil was found in another country in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his bathroom.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
To establish the identity helped the announcement of his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded a partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury in Khanmetov, Mash public reports.
There are other surprises for the athlete.
The attackers who abducted Shamil probably already visited his apartment, the keys of which were also stolen from him.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the received oil and gas revenues in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reported.
The excess, the agency explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as because of the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products at the projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected at +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at organized auctions of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The journalist’s murder underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodos usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa state involving organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, depressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told that they had to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to the office where the grenade had already been thrown in 2009 or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a board hanging in the room: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of covering up the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and this year at least seven people have died in seven states.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, the co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violent crime.
His absence is felt very sharply, although his presence is ubiquitous - a large photo of Waldes, showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodose"; two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, face in the eyes or face in the eyes.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year involving drug trafficking and organized crime, killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although the environment is now much more dangerous.
“Without information about the killers, without justice from talking about security at meetings, there is little use,” Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to waste time in this seminar," he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the Riodose office in the state capital Culiacane.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelveth River".
The shooter drove off in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually diverge quickly across Culiacan.
But about Waldes almost everyone is silent.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Not to mention that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug lords, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a moment that the state of “calm” is simply when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and routes of drug trafficking leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of R<0xC3><0xAD>odos, is crushed by guilt for not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting with the sons of Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n.
The publication may have pissed off the sons; people who were supposedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn’t force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized, which wrote about the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroest and in 2003, together with five colleagues, founded R<0xC3><0xAD>odos, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, R<0xC3><0xAD>odosé received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Award for reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his bravery in investigating drug trafficking in Mexico, wherever it led.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ Awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist – either that or you’re just a fool.”
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodos staff miss Valdez, a prankster who scoffed like a porter, a friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to stay alive.
They depended on their order.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was he destroyed by the love of the once-established order?
His death also made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you understand their wives, their children, their legal business, and clandestine drug-carrying airfields.
“These things were out of order,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from what smells bad.
The problem, says Riodose editor Andrés Villarreal, is that “the delusion can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodose employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shade of a tree from 104 degrees Celsius (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Some journalists asked half-jokingly whether these policemen were among the 50 per cent of law enforcement officers the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue, "Riodos" was counting on three main topics.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chavez.
They also had exposure to government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
Officially it was not announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Recently, loud accusations of corruption have been made against several PRI governors.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzm<0xC3><0xA1>n’s son el Chapo escaped from a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a Waldes column with the most reliable information about the kidnapping.
"We would have known what had happened before," says Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his lean body.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Waldes’ office is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took a few posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n state in the west of the country three days after Valdez was killed.
They found the burned body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists began to speak out louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to gain international support in demanding justice in the Waldes case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their murders for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her any more assignments to cover the government’s activities, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdez has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in the government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are doing so on orders from politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The Committee to Protect the Press, Article 19, estimates that half of last year’s attacks on journalists were ordered by police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez says.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some publications chose to close, like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after its correspondent Miroslava Bri<0xC4><0x8D> was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on as "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez publicly addressed the drug cartels through an editorial on the front page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still see danger in the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for print, Riodose publishers were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootouts between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left behind, according to confirmed data, 19 bodies.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodose website via a mobile phone.
The next day I had to re-write the first page.
Sirens were raised nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the policemen guarding them were ready for defense.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of "Riodos" continued his work.
“How can you think of closing down,” Bohorquez said, “if, on the very day Javier was killed, a trainee asked me to send her outside to report?”
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although it is horrifying.
The researchers said the first remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner were preserved so well that experts called it the “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown—and to say that he had, in a way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best-preserved of Thyreophores in the history of the finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition stunned researchers who called him “really remarkable.”
This herbivorous thyrophorus is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
It was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Sancor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find the animal inside the earth's lump weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s only worth a little peeping, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“It will go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaurs, the Mona Lisa amongst the dinosaurs.”
Studying its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with a shell and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective dye, which is also used by many animals of our day.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with the surrounding environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
This 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaurus family, was widely covered in print in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and gave it the name Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of the museum laboratory assistant Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours on his diligent excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found a protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective coloration is well-known, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the now-living animals with the protective coloration.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred masking confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protective coloration – such as deer, zebras or armadillos – are much smaller and more affordable prey, indicating that the nodosaurus had to fight seriously for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to the massive, powerful shell-covered dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory Cretaceous dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur’s scale also suggests that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he sank and with his back down lay on the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and the rivers and oceans were likely to have spread much further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered by the preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to pee a little, and you can almost believe it’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous Period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, the thyreophore may have been hunted by some of its formidable ancestors.
These include the acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5-metre)-long monster weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum officials, this is the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the snout to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous thyreophore was difficult to step on what is now Canada, until a flooded river carried it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial preserved its shell with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as winning the lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more striking he seems.
Fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bumpy shell plates that sow the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did this without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
About the arrival of Saakashvili reports the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of citizenship, the disgraced politician learned while in the United States.
How he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The period of investigation in the case of Weinsicher and Olkhovik was extended until January
The preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Evgeny Olkhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinsicher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering the question of the extension of the defendants' house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to withdraw and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the leadership of Comey.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinsicher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of CJSC Complex Energy Systems Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company Vimpelkom, handed over bribes to the highest officials of the Komi Republic for establishing the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinsicher and Olkhovik were detained, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was declared a federal wanted man.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented via Airbnb, watching a Facebook feed on her phone.
She bumped into someone in high school.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and he’s still in the middle of the street.”
Noticing that no one else in her tape had posted this information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
She had a lot of user reposts with the nickname <0x40>TheePharoah.
The rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown’s lifeless body spread out across the street, where it would be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put down her phone, and later in the evening returned to tweets that people were going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and screaming people and the man claiming to be Brown’s father holding a poster saying, “A Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, took the gun and shouted, "I will kill you all... animals!"
“It’s a non-standard situation,” Ferrell said in her memoirs.
“This is not a murder like the ones we’re used to and what we might call typical.
At that moment I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the subject of a new documentary, “Whose Streets?”, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the point of view of the people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was traveling to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times before this morning, “about the experience of the blacks and their position.”
She recalls saying, “Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a police officer killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
“I couldn’t help it,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what was happening before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and grow up on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their position and what we must do to become free in order to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had shielded her from it.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, a site across the street from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's final innocence.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who prepared lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell’s consciousness took shape as a new type of activism.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, members of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I have no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her main cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrell came up with the question, “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was prompted by numerous people, often white, who came to the community in order to benefit from his pain and perseverance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get the spotlight and wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on death row issues.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the “Whose Streets?” project team kept in touch during the years following Brown’s assassination.
“In this documentary, there’s no one talking for us or with us, that’s what we’re saying,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because that’s how I will be represented.”
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience at all – to show that the movement “is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community unites,” Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, "Whose Streets?" reveals unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at the first time she saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story again discusses and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the tag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 – identify themselves as gay.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” Ferrell says, “and all because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with the statement, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of gay black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrell was not chosen as the film's central character because of her distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she came to the fore, because when”
You can feel its energy through the screen.”
In Ferguson, meanwhile, there are no cameras, but complex racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell will be on probation for two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: “Bardak.”
She's still clinging to the language she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran Footballers Disqualified for Biting U.S. Players
El Salvador national footballers Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have been long-term disqualified for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of Football Confederations of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bitten American players.
The first was defender Henry Romero.
El Salvadoran bites striker Josie Altidor, then pinches him by the chest.
Then the midfielder Seren when serving the corner in his penalty area bit the U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2: 0, Goal.com reports.
Emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall at the Freedman Gallery in New York, people's faces hang from the ceiling on the wire - white, black and brown, all imperceptibly similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek strokes and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called “The Emergence of Similarities”.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
Analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning with a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though difficult-to-perceive manifesto dedicated not only to the plasticity of DNA data - different ways of interpreting them and the inherent determinism of these interrelationships.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward but has since adolescence openly said she considers herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black and white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum-tinted wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, is sitting behind the wheel of a car; with this photo she began to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project "Vision of Strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some kind of portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait created from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her jailed muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote the comic book Depressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who portrayed how in the future the president would ease Chelsea's punishment and she could visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in a military prison in Kansas.
There’s something profound and powerful about the show opening right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people who reveal classified information in government, and invents new ways to inflame on Twitter the enmity he’s meant to soften.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "nothing happens by chance."
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature downstairs (with a heart instead of a dot over the “i” in her last name) calls for an end to “the automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of C, G and A pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist scientifically elegantly puts it), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we are, at least in our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn’t define what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is,” Dewey-Harborg said in her 2007 video, “False Memories,” also featured here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exposition, which fits in one room, is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the US Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“So never shut up.”
“This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, who welcomes us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning had not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was visibly depicted in the comics – but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacrums gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, as everyone at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning height), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroups.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted by police on murder charge
According to police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who are being sought as suspects in connection with the fact that in a luxurious room in Chicago was found punctured to death.
According to Cook County Court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to release under bail of Windham Latham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, the 26-year-old Cornell-Duranloh died after multiple puncture wounds.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the apartment complex "Grand Plaza" and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death of a knife wound, considering her murder, while the police are intensively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, vice president of communications at the University, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“This is now a criminal case that is being investigated by authorized persons, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbage said.
Warren is a senior fellow at Oxford University’s financial authorities.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been in touch with the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video cameras confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe Professor Latham and the victim were linked,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza leadership issued an appeal to the residents, which reported: “Currently, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA), will be fulfilled in the near future.
RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests in conjunction with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
WADA’s roadmap has been updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to restore the Code compliance status, which lists the conditions for the resumption of the work of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be fulfilled.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures must publicly recognize the results of an investigation commissioned by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not exist.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Undoubtedly, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire extinguishes 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of extinguishing the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is burning in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
The unimaginable outfit of Buzova shocked fans: pants that do not cover the underwear
Scandalous reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova impressed the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live dancing in underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer duet with Nasty Kudri performed the song "We will be hot".
Both girls came out on stage in provocative "breeches", sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers was visible.
On the trousers were made inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported how changes in the appearance of Buzovoy commented on the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
About this on Friday, August 4, reported the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, it is the Russian authorities that are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said that relations between the United States and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and blamed it on the U.S. Congress.
Metro Yekaterinburg develops a new method of payment
In October, travel in the Yekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, General Director of JSC "I-Net" in an interview with the "Regional newspaper".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for travel in the metro, as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro using their bank cards without acquiring tokens and without standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs the San Francisco-based 75-person Madison Reed, an e-commerce hair care company.
Therefore, she appealed to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of startups in the field of work with staff, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee involvement, they allow companies to make express surveys, contact certain teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to pass top management and contact the directorate directly.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where’s Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City’s startup Glynt, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel in the three years she has been using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a thermal map of the company and shows in a visual form which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies gradually realize that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another “Uber”, who was involved in the scandal when a former employee published a blog post in which he described an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the online portal “Let’s talk about payment” dedicated to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Convercent, a Denver, Colorado-based startup that helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight surge in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber’s declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, “Uber” appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made staff opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company treats employees badly or behaves unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of boycotts by customers, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees across 500 establishments, has used Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or e-mail of the head office, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, head of law at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can come closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of the Ruby Tuesday network.
“And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees.”
According to Quinnland, companies began taking employee ethics, values, and engagement more seriously in 2002, after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron case.
But it wasn’t until “social media” became widespread that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty laundry from virally spreading online.
“Before starting to use technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
This is a business model and opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In markets with tough competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just a necessary minimum.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work at a company, they feel they are being heard, and the work they do brings results, they are more committed to making it a success,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global employee benefits and satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Convercent and Glint are used.
Investors make an income when businesses from their portfolio are doing well; businesses are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that changes are coming.
And if changes do not come quickly enough, or do not come at all, may develop disappointment, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be willing to have 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make a mistake relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the staff will be wondering, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
If you don’t care, why should I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
“Ruby Tuesday” is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to more effectively retain employees in an industry known for high turnover of personnel.
“If you’re not trying to create a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul open a new asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where there were pits twice on the recently paved roadway (intersection with the street Youth), decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways was due to the fact that the land was begging in the area of a landless unexploited network.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Roads, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted for a detailed survey and the elimination of the preconditions for the collapse.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of homeless communications and their concreting.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day
The time is approaching eleven p.m.; a crowd of footballers from the University of California, Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new on-campus training fields.
Some of them pulled their T-shirts off, stripping their backs glittering with sweat after a stressful first day of a sports camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness are a mid-day break.
Players enrolled in summer classes will be sent back to the dormitories after a three-hour training session to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to Wasserman Football Center for a 6:30 meeting.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said: “In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat grinder.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was invented to reduce the load for players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 pm, so that they fit into the already dense schedule of players.
A side effect of the lack of two workouts a day was more days with one workout, and Bruins moves the camp start by almost a week compared to last year and conducts training during the summer school for the first time in six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the team of Texas A&M University in September.
Mora said he supported the change of rules on the part of the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that due to him another point appeared in the dense schedule of players.
“Within three or four days, we give them this huge load, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“They just got over it, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California in Los Angeles will make the training closed; it’s not an easy task, as its fields are directly visible from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombed by footballs that have overcome the protective net behind the gates.
The Bruins players are due to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I don’t exaggerate the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a video of the training, it is very serious.
But we'll have security there, and we'll have security in number eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the Vice-Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to the data at the end of July, three people remained in hospitals, reports TV Center.
Recall that the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg thundered on April 3 this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the terrorist attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, were arrested.
We will remind, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the metro of St. Petersburg to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspicious of mystification to independent experts and show their findings under the original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, which is trying to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it was starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the May presidential election, and in Germany, before the September elections, they said they supported a plan to fine social media if they did not promptly remove hate posts.
In a separate German-language statement on Thursday, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing which messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” said Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news feed manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “related articles” feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic book novel: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, the tiny Scottney Castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cosy location in the Beale River Valley in Kent, he watched the turbulent history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with land hair and a penchant for historical documents, to a comic book novel.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says.
"You feel so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about the families that lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes’ first book based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched him to the core.
“I could have been touched by a simple fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
"It's his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those days they lit a fire for lighting.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
I love the archives!"
For a person who has such a passion for old papers, to get support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and live in the castle for four months (“Frankly, I’m a little hospitable there”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes studied the "new" Victorian castle all day, went through the archives and looked at the numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that lay in the ditch for centuries.
He walked around the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and sat down to write."
The history of Skotni Castle is not very well studied, because the National Foundation only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the staff were just beginning to deal with the archives, which he describes as “what the aristocrats had been putting down on the attic for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think the land disputes are boring," Rhodes says, "but two families fought for this birch.
It happens, guys!”
In some stories of the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for broader explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is information about a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex,” says Rhodes.
“The Peasant Rebellion began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was a good start.
“Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Smuggler", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stuffing the coffin with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug).
The Darrells are Rhodes’ favorite family of all who inhabited Scotney: “Gentlemen seem to have been a perfect jewel, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations, men-Darrels solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I imagine them as a company of cute guys who know how to care for the heirs of great fortunes.
After graduating from Castle Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamyanmäki - a place where at the beginning of the XX century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again overgrown with woods.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he said.
“I felt like, ‘Damn it, I have to go back to real life.’”
Fifteen major banks choose Russia
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Otkritie", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that left the ARB will account for at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just an exit - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and a deputy by number.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, interfering with their clientele.
Among other claims was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably withdraw licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many heads of fined banks, in particular, Vneshprombank, were part of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, stating disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the work of the ARB will be at a low level", and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually held.
Investors will be better.
What's the end of the case?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises with the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Headed by “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity in all respects to the interests of banks and their customers, a high-level professional, who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments of “regionals”.
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization advocating the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation in general.
It cannot be said that in the association "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members on any conditions, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that "literally the next day the representatives of our association, the banks that left the ARB, asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers on the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, proposals from both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, emphasizing that "the chair is not held", called possible the new head of the updated association "Russia" George Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now resting in the Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Association Council "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia".
The entry of cars with a gasoline engine in the major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there is the concept of immediately switching to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
This is the same phrase at the level of slogans - let's ban it.
Where and when?
- Tomorrow?
Will the whole city be closed?
“In 20 years, I don’t know, maybe it will happen,” Prime said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC KAMAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with fire engines in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the cash resources that allow them to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
Before we had time to think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological successes in the production of sex robots was published.
Yeah. Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharka, Honored Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the eye color of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see much more of them,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin warm to the touch, and with near-human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "tune" their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot's nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality" compared to which Stepford's Wife would seem very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the company "RealBotix robot" allows users to customize in robots the qualities that they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are still sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "courageous" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours," the True Companion website said.
That’s why she loves what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may be “in the mood”!
There are many concerns about the emergence of sex robots – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, an association with rape, which is caused by the possession of Cold (read: resisting) Farah.
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their appearance and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an optional supplement.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and while the FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for the time being.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots came into existence at a time when women’s rights around the world were threatened, when there was a president in the White House who boasted of being infatuated with women.
The scariest thing about the TV series The Handmaid’s Tale is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the squeezed eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it does not seem so great.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) as technology allows.
Their creators want them to look like touch people, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is their "character" robots are not like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither a life nor a biography—nothing that could point to independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene Jeter, who has been playing for Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
About this in an interview with the portal BeBasket said the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrei Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he's not coming for family reasons.
“We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalised player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took the sixth place at the Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time came to the World Cup in basketball, at which the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has stopped playing for the national team of Ukraine since he left the post of head coach of our national team, American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men’s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their group tournament matches on the promised land.
Evgeny Murzin's wards in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (August 31), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men’s team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
To be Mitt Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the common ground was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke up some families at the micro-level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers shouted columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to bring families together.
I write about it because my cousin, a left-wing poetess from Chicago, who had long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump at the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
Over dinner it’s undoubtedly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has inhaled forces in the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization”, we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his jokes.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly turn out to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing Mitt Romney’s old-fashioned frenzy today – with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) – compared to Trump, both of which seem to be a very small evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids on a Central Park carousel — the biggest carousel in the New York City Parks Department farm and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the glass-fibre images on the central drum – the grimaceous clowns and the animals, who, bent, look at their backs in horror – are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strangely enough, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of buildings are too familiar to cause awe, and the reality of the city does not have time for the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still experiencing the day when I learned that the Suisse Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (the theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not included), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the Central Park carousel is still an unusual, magical place where a child of two years old, a child of eleven years old and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could give the carousel a grade, I would give it a five, but fortunately no one asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked before I took a card through the terminal to evaluate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street all the same plus the option to accompany the assessment with tea at 15 percent - it's for an order at the counter.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowed down, but it is also necessary to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not imply it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled in confusion as I tirelessly assessed my experience of handing her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to treat cuts on his wrists, which the prison administration said he received as a result of a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by the prosecutor’s office against the initial conviction for unintentional murder.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius said he thought his girlfriend was a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor’s office has said it intends to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which it says is too soft.
The Attorney General’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretorius' term could be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in beating NTV journalist selected subscription for non-departure
Capital law enforcement officers chose the measure of restraint in the form of a subscription on non-exit for the man who attacked the journalist of NTV channel Nikita Razvozhaeva during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"In the framework of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Beatings") against a 32-year-old man who struck a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Gorky Central Park of Culture and Recreation, the suspect was chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription on non-exit and proper behavior," Volk said.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol had been drawn up against the suspect for disobedience to the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the live air to the Day of airborne approached the correspondent drunk man and hit the face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the Air Force.
According to Razvozjaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1 in Sithonia, a group of people who set up tents in the wrong place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Foreign Ministry told BBC that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught while parking in an unintended location.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry Accuses US Vice President of Cold War Rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to state that Washington is increasingly turning to the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice “either with the West or with Russia” and the non-obviousness of the thesis of the supposedly non-alternative accession of the whole of South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
The Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law, using force to reject Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop robbing Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher injured in an accident with an ambulance in the Moscow region
The accident occurred in the Moscow suburb of Stupino, as a result of the collision of a foreign car with an ambulance "Ambulance" injured a paramedic.
Today at about 08:10 Moscow there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Moscow region.
Law enforcement officers work at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of the incident are being clarified.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction site, wrapping him in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the police department received a message from a local resident that he found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors went to the scene of the incident, who promptly brought the child to a medical institution," the head of the Odessa National Police said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of umbilical cord.
During the first operational-investigative events, the identity of the pregnant woman - a 36-year-old local resident - was established.
It is also reported that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of view of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously fallen and did not have a special account.
The circumstances and the reasons that prompted the woman to do so are now being determined by the police, and a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into a garbage pipeline.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked with the observer "Izvestia".
I remember when your "half-timber" was celebrated.
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been pretending you wanted to spend your next five years.
Have the intentions come true?
When it comes to the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I am no longer what I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock cannot be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
However, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
With them you are recording a new album, the first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio, and now we're sending him to L.A.
It’s called “Are You So Serious?” after a song of the same name that was written with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the clip on it.
And the album will be presented in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record was handmade by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You think you wanted to bring him into your touring line-up?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to my studio, recorded his parts.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
We were talking about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 thousand to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45 thousand per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed your own (smiles).
Sometimes I want to touch one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wei, after listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with a different performance technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Honestly, I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I’m really sorry I can’t get to America.
I've said many times that I'm studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our performers of popular music have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always solved.
They wanted the best possible sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, Britain has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year, so that I can go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom one, but a poster one, right?
Yes, Monte Carlo has a good sports hall, I've been there before.
Now they have been invited again, and, as far as I know, all tickets to the concert have already sold out.
Will you go to the "Randeva Lyma Vaikula", which will begin on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I certainly responded.
Lima is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who knows how to serve herself with beautiful vocals and even whispers.
After touring and jubilee concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When is the third coming out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done completely differently.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same feed as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to attract Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenshchikov gradually introduced into your repertoire.
Why don't you record an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I’ve talked to him several times and asked him, “Can I sing this or that song?”
He replied, "Grigor, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
It is interesting to record such an album.
I do not have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
Unless you focus entirely on your production center.
I assume you haven't reached his potential yet, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of artists that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serzha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, who I led in the "Voice".
We made a deal with him and we work.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, I'm filming his clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I pay the poets, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will receive a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be pleased if one of them would achieve commercial success and pay me the interest that we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to block the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry to the country, will you go?
I am still invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, by my own conviction, flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what bloggers or other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have succeeded in this situation with Ukraine.
We are one people and we should be together.
I'm sorry this is unlikely to happen, at least not in the near future.
And before that, I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is a pity that now they can not fully throw their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and do a concert with him.
But at the moment, I think it's unlikely...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known, the technical director of the Vostochny Andrey Okhlopkov spaceport began work in the Khrunichev State Space Science and Production Center (GKNPC).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the exploitation of land and space infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Filya, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a changer: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is scattered across the CENKI divisions.
The fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy general director of the CENKI for technological development Andrey Ochlopkov moved to work at the Khrunichev SCNPC, "Kommersant" told the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in a new position for several weeks," the interlocutors of the "Kommersant" in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operative comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Okhlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "<0xD0><0x9A>" was officially confirmed in the CCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of Director for the coordination of production, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Okhlopkov set before him the task to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the cosmodrome Vostochny fully fulfilled.
Mr. Ochlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, serving in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, he held the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Ochlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his filing, regional merchants received state orders for the rollbacks, but did not fulfill the obligations to clean the detachable parts of carrier rockets in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to it by CENKI were extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with “Kommersant” that the situation in the East “was critical as early as October 2013”.
The fact is that the planning made a strategic mistake: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadline was postponed from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to take a trick: CENKI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer occurred (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says a source "Kommersant" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would still not have made a single launch from the East, and would be engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "space Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov and directness remembered: for example, in an interview with "Kommersant" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer on the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has taken over the duties of the general contractor, so that by the planned in the fourth quarter, the construction and installation works at the start and technical complex will be completed.
According to "Kommersant", the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov's transition to a new place of work were disagreements with the management of the CENKI regarding the ways of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of work with subcontracting organizations.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, it will not be easy to find an equivalent replacement for him."
According to "Kommersant", this will not be necessary: the post of the technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the CENKI units.
In music schools there will be a program of training in two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to Sviatoslav Golubenko, Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, for this purpose, it is possible to re-leasing repetitive disciplines to students, and the issue of paying for other classes in the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants, RIA Novosti reports.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Non-Children’s Conversation” with pupils of the children’s center “Sirius”, Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, detained on the wall in a skyscraper 17-year-old Russian
In Mexico, detained 17-year-old Russian Cyril N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, climbed a three-meter fence on the territory of the Nestle office building complex and climbed one of its towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officers from the Ministry of Public Security dropped him on the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It will be determined whether the young man is legally present in the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a hill has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a "spider-man".
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease IBD.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent studies suggest the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and at the same time not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the intestines, appear to increase the tolerance of cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the diet of mice, the more these immune cells they had.”
He suggested the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barrag<0xC3><0xA1>nvas, studying a variety of immune-boosting cells, found that one group of mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but was kept separately, did not have them.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice—communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of the mice's gut cells was sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mice grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid—without bacteria—to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have become tolerance-enhancing cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barrag<0xC3><0xA1>n explains that humans have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease, defects in tryptophan-associated genes have been found.
She says, "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population.”
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United hired a “genius” in the person of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United hired a "genius" in the person of Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, purchased for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season United match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression as a midfielder, while players such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira made an impression in the midfield.
However, since Matic did not participate in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires improvement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is in the way he thinks – he thinks in football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matic, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main line-up by the start of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
“I am grateful to the club for winning three out of four,” he added.
“I’ll be even happier if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot of work for me.”
Former leaders of the Social Democrats of Lithuania persuade them to stay in the ruling coalition
The former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former Speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats <0xC4><0x8C>eslovas Jur<0xC5><0xA1>enas appealed to the party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the “Parliamentary Gazette”, due to frictions with partners – the Union of Peasants and the “Greens” – a discussion has been initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether it is necessary to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here three senior experienced comrades appealed to the party members with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is clear that the disappointment of the party comrades with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for the further implementation of the goals of social justice, which on our initiative are provided for in the political center, and for the preservation of the government program."
According to the former leaders of the party, in the discussion so far “emotional expression of opinion without specific arguments has prevailed”.
The authors of the letter fear that their party’s reckless actions could lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
Disabled Anton Mamaev fined
The Moscow City Court eased the punishment of disabled wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazev court, the convict was released from prison.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and kidnapping of a scooter from a former special forces soldier.
The Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," - explained "Kommersant" the press Secretary of the Moscow City Court Uliana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamaev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a penalty below the lower limit.
As for the assistant of Mamaev Vasily Seroshtanova, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of gravity of the conviction.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was unhappy with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legal solution would be an excuse, intending to continue to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out appealing the sentence in the cassation court of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers right up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled man claims to have bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand rubles, then to sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazev district court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in prison with serving a sentence in the colony of the general regime (under part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobilized disabled person was placed in a detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the human rights commissioner under President Tatiana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from prison by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow City Court.
UNF will prepare a report to the President on the environment
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian Popular Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, "frontlines" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final ONF forum will be held in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key ONF events.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The result will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that were expressed and will be expressed at these events, we will form systemic proposals to solve environmental problems, - the interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Movement, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “front guards” will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the ONF Action Forum are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we have grown up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, we have seen gaps in legislation, and we have stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be included in the report that we are preparing to the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "frontlines" report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told "Izvestia".
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he already took part in the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these issues do not fall off the agenda, - Olga Timofeeva added.
Andrey Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they, as experts, offered at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President, - Andrey Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only to solve their environmental problems, but also to develop ecotourism, - the expert added.
The relevance of the environmental theme was demonstrated by the “straight line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked questions about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhodka (a bill has already been drafted to ban the open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue lies in further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - says the head of the charity fund "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
The member of the Human Rights Council, the head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpeace of Russia" Sergey Tsyplenkov in a conversation with "Izvestia" stressed that for a successful solution of environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business is necessary, there are not enough legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to turn the trend to the fact that the violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor implanted a microchip to get into the house and the car at the stroke of his hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start the car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger, and now through his company, BioTek offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives through technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and machines with chip-compatible locks at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
A married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
Requisites for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to drive a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One” when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 White House event that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials inspected technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department responsible for managing the helicopter, the White House Military Directorate ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn on the occasion of an "unusual" event.
“I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual, widely reported press event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at around 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the working hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security guards remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it was not clear whether a second crew was needed in the end.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, the HMX-1 clarified whether the event was inconsistent with this ruling.
“Among other things, we were asked if this was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“It looks like you have nowhere to go,” replied the deputy chief.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event, and Hatch's law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health care reform that was in development in the Senate at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking them only for the sake of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ screening, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one official, the flight made for the “Made in America” event was counted to the crew in the account of the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not bear the costs for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
The representative of the company Sikorsky said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South lawn.
HMX-1 does not record the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense’s VH-3D reimbursement rate is $24,380 per hour.
The unit’s records show that the aircraft’s time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield based at Quantico Marine Air Force Base in Virginia.
The White House says the real cost of using the helicopter is far below that rate.
“Calculating the cost for taxpayers based on the approximate reimbursement rate is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These indicative rates include personnel, maintenance and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual allocation.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke in favor of using the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week the things made in America,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely sitting on the driver’s seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, grants “Saving Lives” will be allocated to resuscitation and intensive care departments of the capital’s medical clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the Yudin City Clinical Hospital.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedist Victor Protsko, under whose guidance the most complex operation on the reconstruction of the teen's foot was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants annually to intensive care units and intensive care units of urban clinics.
The funds will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of Moscow, the clinical hospital named after Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to conduct unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital, there are dayrooms.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800 people.
The total area, occupying the medical clinic, is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a member of the pilot project on the organization of short-term hospitals (SPC).
They are designed to perform relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
The NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
On Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopeni, to agree on an indirect (via Paritbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
“Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank’s shares in the NBU have not been received,” the statement reads.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the consortium Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
Majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutzeriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutzeriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.
The trailer of the third season of “Narco”: in the popular series of the studio “Netflix” after the death of Pablo Escobar, the central role is played by the cartel Cali
Despite the fact that in the second season of Narcos was revealed the identity of the killer Pablo Escobar, the Netflix series is far from complete.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented with the first trailer showing the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the attention of the Drug Control Agency was attracted by the richest organization of drug traffickers - the Cali cartel.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, operates like a Fortune 500 corporation, with only a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The leader of the cartel – Hilberto Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Orehuela (Damian Alc<0xC3><0xA1>zar), Miguel Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Orehuela (Francisco Denis) – her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of communications with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz-Londo<0xC3><0xB1>o (Pepe Rapasote) works in New York.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character who attracts U.S. and Colombian law enforcement to help in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Mathias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Vilan, Angel Silvestre, Carrie Biché and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be released on September 1st.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overstated,” he said in a statement Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s elections, power passes peacefully for the first time from one democratically elected government to another.
Hayes said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Prosecutor General’s Office approved the indictment in the case of Nikita Belykh
The Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia has approved an indictment in a criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.
About this on Thursday, August 3, reported in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials were transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venice authorities have tightened the fines for swimming in the canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who will organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, TASS reports citing the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for garbage 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of behavior in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy Respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the tourism adviser of Venice Paola Mar, information about the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the home countries of the violators, so as to warn their compatriots from such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the Italian city administration announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, there is already a successful limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice was introduced.
In the first half of 2017, the State Border Guard Service detained 272 illegals at the border with EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported in the state border service.
Of these, 314 people were detained for illegally crossing the border, and the rest - for violation of the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offenses.
The largest number - 717 illegal migrants were detained on the border with Moldova.
272 illegals were detained at the EU border, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
According to statistics, among the detained illegal migrants are mainly citizens of Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India and Armenia.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants were not allowed into Ukraine.
The EU has found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz in "Skolkovo": experiment and improvisation
The program of the second Skolkovo Jazz Science Festival, which will be held on August 26 in the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Guests are expected to perform by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive venues and other musical and intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will become an area of improvisation and a field for demonstrating new creative opportunities.
“The guests of the festival will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovations in science become a new tool for interaction with art”, – Elena Zelentsova, Vice President of the Skolkovo Foundation, described the focus of the forum.
Among the participants of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 there are many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, who will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and it is no coincidence that they merged, - explained the folk artist "Izvestia".
The experimentation and improvisation of jazzmen is valued as highly as scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British man of Nigerian origin, known as his own work, as well as joint work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Jazz lovers are looking forward to the first performance in Russia of the five-time Grammy Award nominee, pianist Christian Sands (USA) with his trio.
In the new capacity will try one of the best academic chamber orchestras "Music Viva" under the leadership of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of pianist Yuri Favorin.
The fusion of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions will be demonstrated by the Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer and performer Lea Slepner.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to become the set of the prize winner Sergey Kurehin Anton Maskeliadze.
An experimental artist controls music and video with gestures – that’s how Leap Motion technology works.
In total, eight musical groups will perform on two stages of the festival.
In addition, the program includes open discussions, interactive zones and art objects, combined with the idea of merging music and science.
Guests will be able to take part in experiments, visit a scientific buffet and observe the creation of cryo-ice cream or rocky sands from starch and water.
In the special zone of vinyl it will be possible to buy records of current jazz performers and representatives of other musical directions, and at the book fair - publications on various topics, including music, popular science and biomedical literature.
SF dismissed Ozerov from the post of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Ozerov and dismissed him from this post.
He remains a senator from the Khabarovsk Territory.
A statement asking to be released from the post of Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not instantaneous.
Since 1996, Viktor Ozerov has represented the legislative assembly of the Khabarovsk Territory in the SF of the Russian Federation.
The Defense and Security Committee has been headed by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for residents and for commodity producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Electricity Production and Supply (Power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of the Republic of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No 842) established indicative prices for electricity and power
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate life for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the republic’s leaders have been beating the thresholds of Moscow’s cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on Angara flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
It was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles / kWh to 3.93 rubles / kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of wholesale price zones, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, a number of industrial consumers have emerged.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays for a kilowatt-hour of 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff moves towards a downward trend for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie’s factory in Glasgow.
The union requires assurances from the managers of the biscuit maker McVitie’s in connection with its long-term commitment to manufacture at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent about the issue of future investments at the Tolcross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, says it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in case of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “will learn about them first”.
In a letter to the head of the company-owned facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded from McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed for the modernization of production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility’s general manager on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in the territory of Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising subsistence levels and chronic declines in production, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs a flourishing production at McVitie’s factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The head of the Tolcross facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the trade union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives in Tolcross, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to employees about how, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolcross facility, especially in production lines and performance improvements.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know about it.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (O petrochemical company) should be joined by the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, as well as Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to help resolve the contradictions.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC jeopardizes the timing of the project.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
“Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources,” Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to allow it to use gas from the Kirinsky field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on this issue are ongoing, and "there are no sharp corners there."
Did PSG warn Barcelona of Neymar’s transition three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when Ligue 1 was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transfer, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
It is known that FC Barcelona is furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar terminated his contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the leadership of the Catalan club, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transfer from Santos in 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG’s best players.
“I don’t worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand against them, we will make offers to their players,” he said.
“We have respect for all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not let the Italian national team player go under any conditions, and now it is likely that Barcelona feels the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin instructed to deal with the payments to the victims of forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed to understand the material assistance, which is allocated to the victims of forest fires residents and the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.
In particular, please report on the situation with payments, compensation to the affected citizens.
I have a bit of a discrepancy.
"On this occasion, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money is allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the plenipotentiary representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergey Menaylo and the head of the Baikal branch of the FGBU "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then they showed the fry in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few cubs from the sack.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry of construction, one volume is needed, and a different volume is supposedly provided.
“I want to deal with this, which, in fact, is happening in our country with funding,” the Russian leader stressed.
We will remind, during the forest fires of 2017 the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region were covered with fire, residential houses and farm buildings were destroyed.

In the city, where 15,000 people live, there will be a special legal regime of entrepreneurial activity, as well as a minimum amount of capital investments of residents, a minimum number of new permanent jobs.

It is also planned to reduce the dependence of the territory on the city-forming enterprise of Abakan Mine LLC.
In January 2017, the authorities of the region reported that Khakassia had fulfilled all the conditions of the Ministry of Economic Development for the creation of TOPs.
The authorities of the Orenburg region did the same.
There, in the city of Novotroitsk, an area of advanced socio-economic development will also be created.
This will allow to diversify the economy of the monocity, reduce its dependence on the city-forming enterprise of Ural Steel JSC, as well as create more than 2.3 thousand jobs and attract investments in the amount of more than 8 billion rubles.
The list of economic activities in which the new TOP will have a special legal regime for entrepreneurs includes, in particular, freshwater fish farming, the production of feed, medicines and medical materials.
Novotroitsk became the first of the mono-towns of the Orenburg region to receive the status of TOR.
The territory of advanced development is an economic zone with preferential tax conditions, simplified administrative procedures and other privileges, which is created to attract investment to improve the life of the population.
Among the benefits for residents of TOR can be identified the following: a profit tax of not more than 5% for the first five years, and not less than 10% for the next 5 years, social contributions of 7.6% for 10 years, the use of the free customs zone regime, preferential connection to various infrastructure facilities, as well as preferential rental rates.
The vine called Manson “sucker” and threatened to “put in the face”
Yuri Loza expressed his outrage at the statement of American rock musician Marilyn Manson, who insulted Moscow.
In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson “disgusting” and “sucker.”
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson for his words should be “put in the face”.
Recall, the American artist, known for his outrageous actions, rudely spoke about the Russian capital at a concert in Kiev.
Earlier on Thursday, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that Manson's statement was commented by the domestic producer Joseph Prigozhin.
