What will he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or a confectionery
The new city councillors from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will probably have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague council and in the representative office.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC3><0xAD>.cz has "tested" the members of the new council from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they know the notorious slang that arose in the city hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political clutter during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous characters, situations and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councillors did not understand the familiar concepts very much.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a rookie in Prague politics," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, the culture councillor, responded to a test of the "Kmotrovsk<0xC3><0xBD>" dictionary.
And while he is a political veteran, Councilman Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the term "golf hole."
"It's the only expression you give me that I use sometimes."
"I generally don't recognize slang."
The editorial board selected six examples from the dictionary, the terms of which were published by the daily Aktualno.cz in June this year before the ODS election congress, mainly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague City Hall.
The socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "bull neck", "betrayal of the capital" and "sweat".
Three of the councillors agreed to the quiz, the fourth - Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who is to head Prague's education in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused the test.
“I don’t deal with these things at all, and I won’t judge how the Civic Democrats are enjoying themselves.”
"I am now considering how we will understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kautsk<0xC3><0xBD> would not have recognized in the headline above that he was talking about an influential businessman and a friend of the Bém’s exponent, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kautsky, and the only term he correctly guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague".
"That's Blanka's tunnel," Kautsky says, and immediately adds: "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf hole as the Blanka tunnel is not only deciphered by the matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by the environmental councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
The two Social Democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> the Shy is also familiar with where to find this character - he suspects the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery" .
"I think that means going to some Prague business," is Shaky close to deciphering that this is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
He recalls, along with B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency test, there is no such established vocabulary of slang expressions.
"I've consulted with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have anything like that."
"We call each other names, sometimes abbreviations and comma of names are used," says Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, chairman of the Czech Social Democratic Party (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), whom the parties call Hulda.
"At school they called me Birch, but I don't know if my colleagues call me Birch," he confesses to his nickname, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The name has been tried and it works.
Councillor Weinert is for the Deda party or less friendly Dedek, the deputy of Miroslav Poche, who warned about fraud in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in intra-party speech.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to hear Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC3><0xAD>.cz recorded another nickname of this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Stamp Law" reminds that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of “witches”, has published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso have several common characteristics.
Rather, they belong to the older generation, they cannot engage in work, for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to endanger the rest of the village.
"A man's fate is seldom reached."
“Young healthy women are not being expelled because they help with work and give birth to children,” describes a nun who takes care of more than a hundred women in a special house in Burkina Faso, the capital of the West African state, who have been expelled by their community.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information brochure that should help limit the witch hunt.
But there's a catch.
“More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” Die Standard reported.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Burkina Faso, Ghana, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured kerosene and set her on fire.
The case was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was inflamed with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
He said the group wanted to “put the demon out of the woman.”
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of their level of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying: "The devouring of human souls has always been a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the witch hunt is being moderated by the government, in Gambia, the president himself participated last year.
"After the death of his aunt, the Gambian president Jammie launched a large-scale witch hunt, allegedly to take part in her death and try to use black magic to kill the president himself."
"He called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the President's personal protection, forcibly took randomly selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the President's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in a statement.
On the farm, the imprisoned people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly 1,000 prisoners were eventually released.
Bakal's tenant: Melting in the stoves, higher rent signed
An older underprivileged man stepped out of the door of the RPG Client Center by "Uhlobaron" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rented apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new leases for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in prison.
The deregulation has raised rents for all three of them.
Instead of 3,500 per month, the son will pay CZK 4,100 for the second category apartment 2+1 from next year.
"And that's not hot water, and petrama has to be melted," the man says with his finger in his son's new contract, which he has full authority to sign.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which has called the new lease terms "incorrect and immoral", advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until December 7th to publish instructions on how to proceed against them.
But the man's just waving his hand at it.
"One says it, the other says it," he frowns.
Ostrava is becoming a major laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that have not yet been rented in the Czech Republic are waiting.
This is why I decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ovsk<0xC3><0xA1> waiting room RPG is one of four in Ostrava and it is already full on Tuesday at nine in the morning.
Security guards from the security agency are standing right next to the door and there's a trigger.
"Miet 2011", there's a special button on his touch screen.
One tap and a paper with a number will come out of the machine.
You won't even be able to read "157" and your digit is already beeping on the large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
You're up in half a second.
After a while, an older married couple comes to ask about the rent, but the rush in the waiting room obviously does not concern new rents at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems like other times - requests for repairs, insurance events and the like.
In Ostrava, most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio have been delivered to the mailboxes by tenants since around mid-November.
RPG Flats in their letters proposes to increase the rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special counter for new rentals was opened at the client center on 18 November.
"It's been going on for over a week, so it's just in the running," the workers answer behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining flats are a local incendiary theme.
Before the elections, the deputy speaker of the parliament and Ostrava native Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek from the CSSD took him quite noisyly, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years later, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change my toilet seat," the man said in the introduction.
Most so far, according to employees, pensioners come to see if they will get a discount on rent if they sign in time, as the RPG promises them in a special offer.
Half of the discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
The "deregulatory" desk in Hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov, however, is definitely not crowded with questions.
“Of yesterday’s 360 clients, there were only about forty to fifty people here for the 2011 rent,” the employees estimate behind the counter.
The RPG proposes individual negotiation of contracts on the site and its boards where it is needed.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"This is not a threat, but information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG said on its website.
"There won't be a trial here," thinks one of the RPG Byty employees, and the man on the street in front of the client's center gives her part of the truth.
“I have a 13,000 pension and I have 5,000 left to eat, I have no right to sue,” he said.
The employee will soon become insecure.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek tells them in the media not to sign, so people probably wait," he thinks.
Rent regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The current rent still does not reach even the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that the irritated tenant's neglect of the housing stock is the main reason for the increase in rents, according to the owners of the houses.
While in the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPGs could invest four billion in apartments from rents, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the hav<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> waiting room so far repeats several red-emphasized information.
"The rent increase in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, that is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most by 7.50 CZK per square meter and a month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will receive a 38 percent increase in rent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," the RPG warns.
For 2,600 apartments, next year's rent will remain the same.
RPG Flats promises that deregulation will not drive out rents by leaps and bounds, but will be spread over four to eight years.
In addition, it adds an additional commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) the company will give back to the apartments, mainly in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
They should be given priority to people who sign an agreement to increase rents.
There is also a kindergarten, the architects understand.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to hide also a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
Arch.Design, a design and architectural company whose studios were the basis of a number of important Brno buildings, counted on the space for its company mini-school from the very first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs almost 90 people, mostly at the age of the babyboomer, and it was important to her that women designers and architects could quickly return to work.
Along with the possibility of shortened hours, kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of a social program.
Thus, builders and architects have the opportunity to combine a demanding job with childcare.
The mini<0xC5><0xA1>kolka was invented by the Arch.Design employees themselves and with the support of the management they managed to obtain a subsidy from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The corporate mini-school is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (subsidy of CZK 2.8 million), they could purchase equipment and equipment and provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After the financial subsidy has been exhausted (2 years), Arch.Design is obliged to operate the mini-school for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project took one year and the application for a subsidy was significantly assisted by the company Economy Rating.
The care is provided by qualified staff, the nurse and the teacher of the Ministry of Education take care of the children all day long, so children without age restrictions can go to kindergarten, but most of them are over 3 years old.
Since it is a "miniskolka", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but more will be replaced during the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of position in the company.
Although this is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework program of preschool education.
Children not only play here, but they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic cognition to preparation for school benches, the English language is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and stressful situations with delayed picking up of children from kindergartens away from the parents' workplace are eliminated.
Parents use their working hours more productively.
It is no wonder that there is a naturally loyal employee-employer relationship.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personnel marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look inside the interiors by Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase resembles the backbone of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> in Barcelona by Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Due to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, tile fragments and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all are typical of the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The facade of the house plays out dream lines, gentle colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With detailed observation, you can see geometry, rhythm and a well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the gloss of colors is further enhanced.
The twisting and twisting of shapes occurs equally in interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of the door, hoods and railings.
The Batll<0xC3><0xB3> House, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA1>cia No. 43, was rebuilt in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sal Cortes.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a completely new one, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> himself.
It was designed by architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his designer plank that decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
Many other artists and artists also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>’s designs kicked off Jujola’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s Casa Mil<0xC3><0xA1> and Güell Park, which contains other works by Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
From the locals, the house soon after its completion, thanks to its organic shapes, earned the nickname "House of Bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it a "going house".
It is also said that at the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs include other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed for his time a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination may seem bizarre.
When creating Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> absolutely did not respect the then building regulations and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he obtained a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the construction was completed, the city council was appalled and asked for repairs.
For example, the councillors were disturbed by the fact that the building was interfering with the pillars and the public sidewalk.
On the contrary, it was never repaired: only fifteen days after the challenge of the city district, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and successfully obtained) permission to lease the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a lounge and on the third floor a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewellery.
The whole six-storey house intersects the stairs, which can be climbed to the roof terrace itself.
The main elements of the reconstruction were the removal of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, the house with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s reconstruction also received unconventional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>'s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, which line the courtyard, and skylights is also impressive.
The play of two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which, on the contrary, absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house, the most spacious and luxurious apartment is made available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They stayed on the tours, as they found that it was a very advantageous business, and in addition they expanded the tours to include common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is definitely not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you need to quickly make friends with one of the tenants of the apartment and visit it directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grid: women have different requirements than men
Not the grand frame of the bed, but the quality of the sleeping area, i.e. the mattress and the grid, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a specific user.
When choosing, many things are decided, from weight, height, age, health and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattresses and the grid are purchased.
Typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not regularly warm up, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane mattress.
In this case, it is necessary to turn them regularly.
Because if they do not have a lot of vents in the core, and still lie on a hard board, they retain moisture: there could also be mold under them.
It is also customary to choose.
Who has spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, it will be difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Perhaps all the hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they wouldn't sleep here."
"They needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam on their battered shoulders, heels and hips."
“These are recommended for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they misreceive ‘information’ from the joints and skin,” explains Sylva Hadamczik, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, but also other customers, were looking for a mattress with lazy foam years ago.
"Today it's cool, suitable mattresses have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing is pressing you, you will not turn over at night like after a hard game.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also acts as a protection against debris.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add the length of the foot to your height, which is usually about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for a double bed, i.e. 180 cm in total.
For single beds, such as singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For comfort and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly bent in your elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, guildmaster of the Upholstery and Decorators Guild, who has been dealing with the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and lectures it at vocational schools.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to match the heights of the mattresses.
There is nothing else to do but to mount the grids to different heights, but this may not work for every frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring skeleton of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on a molding and simmering layer.
"You must not feel the springs when you touch your hands or get on the mattress," warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
Full-covered beds, where the mattresses and the base are like siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are poorly ventilated, it is impossible to wash their cover, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat 0.2 to 0.75 liters per night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress begins to resemble a large (and clogged) sieve.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the lifespan of mattresses up to 25 years, or even a lifetime warranty.
But everything has its ales.
That’s why the advice from retailers: do not give up the removable coating for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, but add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Even though mattress covers are commonly made around the circumference, so when unplugged, we get two parts (very important for washing and washing machine size!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a light weight duel in the ring with a heavy one.
Do you have a slab in your bed instead of a grid?
Never!
Maximum on the bed intended for one night visits.
However, the board should still be fitted with ventilation holes (if it no longer has them) and use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (from it.Taschenfederkern) and a simmering layer.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a basis.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (for example, a combination of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-positional lamella grills with 14 to 18 lamellas, but you always pay for grilles with more lamellas, 28 or more, where the lamellas are doubled in the thigh area and it is possible to regulate their stiffness.
The positioning lamellas do not include mattresses with spring skeleton, as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, you can also indulge in the so-called shoulder cradle.
It is a special attachment of the slats, which allows you to push or even tilt the slat so that the shoulder of the sleeper is nicely "fallen".
For men who have "shoulder-to-shoulder" is definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses remember it, who in the "men's" began to use the softening zone in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - they are given a softer surface in places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers are designed wing or plate grids with so-called multitorsion springs.
The pressure decomposes into multiple points and the voltage decreases.
However, beware, once you apply the wrong pillow (large and "swollen") to the right mattress and grid, most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and only touch the shoulders with its tips so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
As a suitable size, 50 x 60 cm is recommended, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should balance the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder cradle of the grid or the softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original straws filled with grasses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also in mattresses.
Raw materials from oil, from which polyurethane foams are made, are replaced by natural oils, for example, from skimpy and soybeans.
Soybeans are used by all well-known producers.
"Bio at the mattress means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr V<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress coatings, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also allow microcapsules to release the fresh smell of wood or lavender.
There is also a division between men and women.
While men are "cooled" by the plant extract from birch to allow the mattress cover to absorb heat and cool the body, women, on the contrary, "warm" the covers.
Red pepper extract increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with broken cellular structure, is thus more breathable than conventional polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
Combining the different stiffnesses of cold foams and "lazy" foams, multi-zone mattresses are created that know exactly where the head, thighs and heels should be.
For a quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those that meet the health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as health aids.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage.
Saving on a mattress and a grid is not easy.
Sometimes you can use the events of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with Memory foam sewn into the cover for CZK 11,990.
The second one can be purchased for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and high density was started by the Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because during the launches, the astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur softens in the heat, but in the cold it strengthens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and optimally distributes its pressure.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of deformities, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which relieve the legs and venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C foam or Twinsaver foam and the like.
Human tracking devices want more and more parents, so they want to look after their children
Fear of owning a child is driving more and more people to the idea of babysitting via GPS.
The system originally created for the search for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in such cases as the disappearance of nine-year-old Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The device is about the size of a matchbox so far, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not spying, but another way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy happening,” said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases, such devices can be abused, for example, when they are put in a bag by someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Most of the time, customers buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> points out that if the child does not want to wear anything like this, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don’t want to be in control.”
"There were high expectations for parents of mobile phones, but they can be turned off just like these surveillance devices," Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
It is also disputed whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"In the case of an imminent abduction, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal his or her location."
"It's a phone now."
“When tracking devices start to expand, they will look for them too, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.”
“In this case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he admits that such a device can help in case of sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech from RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even in the event of an immediate destruction of the tracking device after the attack, his presence can help.
"The device can be set to send the position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"More expensive devices have built-in tilt meters, so even if a person just slips and stays still, the device immediately sends a warning with the location," says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
According to him, a similar service can be taken by smart mobile phones with navigation, where you just need to upload special software.
The problem with the current surveillance units is that they are either devices the size of a matchbox pendant or smaller mobile phones.
They are always at risk of losing it.
According to Pilin of Macro Weil, a device that looks like a regular digital watch is now being tested.
"That will have the biggest advantage of not knowing the tracking device at all."
"Otherwise, he'll recognize them after a while, and that could give the police extra time," he added.
Whether the tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used to watch the cars.
It is a combination of GPS positioning (which uses conventional auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has the incendiary cords to wrap up the Czech Republic, but it will only last for two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of cords used to detonate explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense delivered 224 kilometers of cord to the warehouses.
The military has 225 years' worth of supplies.
The problem is that the durability of the cords is two, a maximum of four years.
The army bought the incendiary cords from STV Group, a. s. for CZK 40 million.
The general staff, justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of incendiary cords, wrote that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of incendiary cords per year in training.
However, from the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, which the Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Serbia addressed today, it follows that then all generals, officers of the army command, secretaries or cleaners would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defense Minister Alexander Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimil Pick, not to mention.
This is the only way to justify the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of lighters.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
And even if that were the case, the army's stockpile would be enough for more than a decade.
On the contrary, if it were true that for the basic training of each new professional, a maximum of two meters of incendiary cord is enough, as experts say, then the army has freshly purchased - even with increased consumption of engineer or special forces - supplies for the mentioned 225 years.
The soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently personally complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for small arms, so even shootings due to the need for money are limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't mind them buying so many lighters from us over and over again."
"But it's their decision, and they know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders try to meet," says Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, sales manager of the STV Group.
Defence ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said hundreds of kilometers of purchased cords would be justified by the fact that the army would have stockpiles of this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from the STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year lifespan of the lighter and police or army pyrotechnicians even only about two years.
"With perfect storage, it could be the four of them," says one of them, who as a soldier because of criticism of the army does not want to publish the name.
At the end of their service life, each ammo must be carefully tested to ensure that it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument of the Ministry is the quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of incendiary cords.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firing lines of police pyrotechnicians destroying World War II munitions or after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to use this ammunition before the end of its life.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnics, and it can more flexibly acquire more modern and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defence is already having considerable difficulties in dismantling tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the two-hundred-thousand-strong Czechoslovak army was preparing to march on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnicians that MF DNES has addressed, awaits the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old lighters, which today "lacino" buys.
To this day, I draw on the contacts I have gained through the competition.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun’s winning place in the Trader of the Year competition helped him sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition Trader of the Year was the twenty-eight-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a half-destroyed house with five apartments.
It was a great courage to be a third-year college student at the time.
"The then ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation with us did not give me, so I did not try to do anything about it," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All the profits he invested back in the house, which he gradually converted into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, over seven years of business, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of them was until recently a four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, another one of the same quality was added to it.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostr<0xC3><0xB3>w u Tisé, where we sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says last year's tradesman number one.
“And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, the victory in the Trader of the Year competition was very much involved,” adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, often congratulated me extra and I have to say that it was pleasant," she recalls.
I would definitely recommend this contest to anyone who is trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win, any visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances he might not otherwise have gotten into.
“I started trading with some of the people I met because of the competition.”
The fame associated with success, according to him, fell somewhat on every employee.
And he's got about seventy of them.
"I see a greater loyalty and pride in them in participating in something that has gained universal recognition."
“It’s not just my personal success, it’s the result of the good work of all of us together.”
"Only my name is put in the foreground," Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun says modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, due to the goal-orientedness of the winner, Farmet has worse times behind him.
Last year, the owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, came to the Slavonic House for the prize for the first place in the last year of the Vodafone Company competition.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts through which he built a company with hundreds of millions of turnovers from a small tool shop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice.
“I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all of my co-workers and increased our confidence in the competition,” the winner said.
At the beginning of Farmet’s history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered to rent a small workshop to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father as compensation for the Communists’ confiscated property, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father they founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness even among the unprofessional public after achieving success in the competition through the media.
“Not only our customers began to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners began to appreciate that they are cooperating with a company that has achieved greater success in its country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
However, the past year in Farmet was not only in the sign of euphoria from the victories.
The award was based on the company’s economic results until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
The year 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering goods.
There was a crisis that had not yet affected citizens so much, but companies had already stopped their investment projects and began to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, hasn't escaped us either."
“The sales decreased by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed the situation and kept the company in profit, albeit less than before the crisis.
However, what Farmet did not fail to do was to invest in research and development.
“With subsidies, we have built a research and training center, strengthened the presentation at international fairs, won the main awards in domestic exhibitions,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
All indications are that the crisis is behind them.
Sales are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the business race.
Some senseless rules have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year’s Absurdity of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
This was decided by more than a third of the less than 4,000 voters.
For example, the Social Security Administration required a paper extract from the Commercial Register, even though an official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the commercial register during checks on the insurance payers," said Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesperson for the CSSA.
To focus on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to cancel the meaningless ones, is the purpose of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth time this year that it has been part of the business competition organized by Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny and it is becoming more and more popular among the public.
If last year’s vote was attended by about three thousand voters, this year there were almost four thousand.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that serve only to delay business, there is still enough and enough in our country.
"For example, in the number of tax credit cards we are in the leading positions in the world," notes Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Business simplification has become the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the rest of the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not particularly improving.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, which is eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
Afterwards, the organizer of the competition will select seven candidates for the "anticipation" and will have the public vote on it in October via the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year’s survey included more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations that do not make sense.
Tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
Among the finalists of the competition, for example, there was a requirement that cars for maintenance of highways and expressways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is published on the competition's website.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November at Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapening, which is regularly attended by the personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted at this climax of the competition.
“Economic prosperity cannot work where the state throws sticks at entrepreneurs, which is why my goal is to cancel at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break senseless regulations doesn't sound empty.
In 2007, the people were most disturbed by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office at the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with the stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most-voted duty in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for a foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
A third of all good.
The absurdity of 2009 was the order to physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two scales in the office.
This was eased this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator was dropped.
The new category rewards socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are evaluated.
This year’s fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny competition is a new category called Responsible company of the year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of mobile operator Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
This year’s first year of this special subcategory of the Vodafone Company 2010 main competition was attended by companies for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and he would publish on a separate article.
Although the subject matter of their activities differs drastically from each other, support and consideration can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case, it concerns, for example, people with disabilities, and in another case, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen nationwide finalists, for example, was the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice Region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of a grant fund sponsoring handicapped children for seventeen years.
The paper mill from Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady, which has more than 70 percent of its employees with disabilities, takes care of its disabled employees, which is why it has won the title of the responsible company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it was ranked third in the region.
In Olomouc, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced flexible working hours, further reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionally reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title for the fact that she prefers to buy from Czech manufacturers, supports civic activities in the vicinity and saves the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have the least possible impact on the environment,” explains Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region thinks about the health of its employees and has purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop at its corporate events.
"In addition, we support the Human in Need Foundation, which helps specifically the local Roma community," says Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>, a representative of the company.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their employees in the form of premium bonuses to their pension supplementary insurance.
"In our country, in turn, we make contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D> from the Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l construction company Czach, winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically enrolled in the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing company did not answer the questions, they could not take part in the competition Responsible Company of the Year, but they are not disqualified from the "main" competition Vodafone Company of the Year."
“Separate entry to this competition is not possible, as it is a subcategory of the main competition “Firma of the Year”, explains Karel Goldman from the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, the police arrested during a public tender
Anti-corruption police have been arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days.
The detectives put handcuffs on the local media entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the ongoing public competition to settle restitution claims so that the land offered in the competition would win a specific bidder.
He had to pay half a million crowns for it.
"For the time being, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for perjury in public procurement and in public tenders," said Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1>, the head of the Pilsen Public Prosecutor's Office, saying that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
The 46-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The way in which the competition could have been influenced can only be speculated, given the minimum of official information.
A spokeswoman for the Land Fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, when asked by Prava, said that police officers were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen, during a public competition.
"It was the client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public tender has the correct title "Call to submit an offer of rights for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and is held in the event that several eligible applicants show interest in the offered land.
"These persons, in the framework of the call, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the proposed claims, the order of the acquirers is determined and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokesperson explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information on who had applied for the call, and since he himself was also an entitled person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered the applicant for the land not to participate in the competition.
He must have collected the severance pay for it.
That would explain that he had such a large sum of money when he was being held.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had superior contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He appeared in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing land in a replacement restitution, on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
It was then that Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. acquired from the fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically in the place where the access highway to the industrial zone Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> pole was to be built.
Later it was very conveniently exchanged with the magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to accept this, because otherwise it would have jeopardized the construction by blocking the land.
Households pay hundreds of dollars a month
From January, households will have to pay not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewage, heat supply and rents will grow somewhere.
As of January, families will have to withdraw hundreds of crowns more from their wallets per month than they do now.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, and in some cities you will have to pay a tenth for water supplies, and in many places it will also cost the supply of central heat.
The cost of electricity to households in apartments should cost hundreds of crowns per year than it does now.
All major suppliers have lowered electricity prices, which is why there is a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, especially photovoltaics.
Although gas is slightly more expensive, it is at a time when people are drowning the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Therefore, it also has to count hundreds of crowns per year.
While electricity and gas are priced across the country, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay about 50 crowns per month for central heating from January, more than 1000 crowns per year for families in Liberec.
Residents of Prague are at risk of increasing their water and wastewater prices by more than 9%, if the city increases rents from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, they will add 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still belong in the national comparison among the lower ones.
In the north of the Czech Republic, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage prices are expected to increase by 7.4 percent.
For example, the rental price of 450,000 rented apartments, where the regulation ends in January, may increase significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, plans to increase rents by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who do not agree with the new level of rent, intend to bring the company to court.
Regulated rents paid by people in some 300,000 apartments could rise by as much as 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk on ferret and rum. Beer is out of fashion, acting slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally even a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks, after which drinking ends most often in the care of doctors drunkards, who are not even fifteen years old.
The exception is not children who are treated repeatedly in the hospital from a monkey.
This is due to the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases in the incomes of children's departments of hospitals.
“Some beers or wines are completely unfashionable because it takes a long time to get drunk with them.”
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, the Prime Minister of the Children's Department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"If they can get Daddy's bottle out of the closet, it's like whiskey, otherwise it's Fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice and not feeling so much," the prime minister explained.
And the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, also gives him the right.
"Most often it's Fernet or Rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was plums that they brought from home," Jurin said.
According to Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers on hospital admissions are a fairly common phenomenon.
In front of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years on pediatrics in Motol, where ambulances transport shoddy schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of 12 when she was brought to us with 3.5 milliliters of alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor said in a statement.
"She was at the exhibition ground in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for some dance party."
"What's interesting is that her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister said.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing child drunkenness.
However, it is impossible to talk about dependence in the true sense of the word, according to experts, in children.
"Alcoholic" means a multi-year chronic addiction to alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and it is not in children."
"Those who use alcohol repeatedly are more likely to have an unsatisfactory family-social background," Pelikan said.
According to a spokeswoman, this year about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at a pediatric clinic in Motol until mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get into the statistics.
Children’s drunks who are taken by their parents after outpatient treatment, or taken home by the police, are not counted.
Except for the cases when children just sit down after school and drink a bottle of liquor, there are three seasonal fluctuations on which one can rely: the witch, New Year’s Eve and the end of the school year.
"They're either drinking the sadness of a bad testimony, or they're celebrating the beginning of the holidays."
"But I've experienced seven child drunks at the same time," Pelikan said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically advantageous compared to someone who suffers an unpleasant hangover the next day at home.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and a lack of glucose will drive away irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they have a good awakening after that beautiful evening experience and nothing hurts."
"They're just confused about where they are," Pelikan admitted, sometimes spoiling the patients' pleasant mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization on an acute bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
“Sometimes I used it as an educational tool, when I calculated directly to those children at the visit how much their drunkenness cost, and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make money on that one party,” Pelic<0xC3><0xA1>n added.
According to him, however, health insurance companies do not engage in regression proceedings, in which they would recover the costs of treatment from parents, in cases of child drunkards.
Two L-159 aircraft in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 aircraft from a total of five units, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, on Tuesday departed for Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they have only been abroad for training or demonstration years.
It is a two-seat version of the L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army and which was capable of flight.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These are still preserved in Aero Vodochody and the intermediary - Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the planes will physically take off from Vodochod, according to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the press department of defense is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the exchange were allocated from long-term stored aircraft, without additional deposits and investments from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs."
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and form," said P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>vo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army will not remain without two-seat aircraft, since the Ministry in May 2009 signed a contract with Aero Vodochody worth 200 million crowns for the conversion of four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS has pledged to put the aircraft into service with some of the allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will be used to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore up to the customer how he will implement this thing," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
According to the newspaper, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirko Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The Ministry of Defence did not issue a tender for the purchase and contacted EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest they would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa planes will likely also have a court record.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice on the grounds that it should have selected the aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not with the support of a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last to arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within fourteen days.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring finger are less likely to develop prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
It may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, especially in combination with genetic risk or other endangering factors such as family health burdens, Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients and more than 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants had an index finger on their right hand shorter than a ring finger.
They had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, for those who had the index finger longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, while for men under 60, it was even a decrease of 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - seems to reflect the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Paces, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knew about this study in a short time, but he did not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer was "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and sidewalks are mostly snow-covered, and road users have been driving all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and 93th kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars, and there is also the D1 near Brno in the direction of Prague.
The dispatcher of the Central Motor Club (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) told the news outlets.
A truck crashed at 91 km, two trucks collided at 93 km, causing injuries.
A number of cars also ended up in the ditch.
Problems are also on the D1 motorway at 185 km in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190th kilometre or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometre on K<0xC3><0xBD>valka.
There are several kilometers of columns.
There is also an accident on the D11 motorway, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a few centimeters of snow, thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Prosek, St<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also clogged.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example, on the line between Charles Square and the Peace Square.
The Prague Crisis Staff is scheduled to meet again at 8 a.m.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
Czech railways have already had to cancel seven high-speed connections due to snow.
For example, the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from Wednesday 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already movable, but only with increased caution.
Three side roads are impassable in the Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov region, snow tongues are sometimes formed in the Brno region and snow chains are necessary in the Blansko region to overcome some of the roads in the above places.
Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko was one of the most affected places.
There are still closed roads: Rous<0xC3><0xAD>nov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
It will be necessary to put milling cutters in their extension.
When they will be transported, it is not yet possible to estimate.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>n, caution is needed in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which are maintained there for the sake of nature protection only by inert sprinkles, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, the CTK said.
In the Czech Republic, from two to ten centimeters of snow fell, the most rain fell in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall in the Czech Republic gradually ceases.
The U.S. military has a new “smart weapon”
The U.S. military has deployed a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and “change the game” in their favor.
A new weapon is like a small super-precise cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
The special 25 mm cartridges, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, actually act as small grenades.
The bullets can be programmed to explode not only when they hit a target, but at any point in their ballistic path.
They can therefore be used against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, and when the murderous rain of steel fragments falls on it, it can knock it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding the target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, so he gets a specific intended point, according to him adjusts the gauge and presses the tap."
"Let's say you've measured 543 meters."
“When you pull the trigger, the weapon is loaded and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters,” he said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs in July next year from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
Fujitsu is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the existing administrative building to the Marienbader-Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large administrative complex on Lyonnais Street, in a part of Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to a spokesman for Fujitsu, another 100 of the group’s jobs, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The offer of rent was said to be very attractive and the large-sized offices in Astro Park are said to be more suitable for the employees’ working style.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only for rent.
Competent CEO Bernd Wagner said, “We found a central headquarters in Frankfurt-Niederrad with excellent infrastructure.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region yesterday caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The head of economics at Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that this has managed to get a "global player".
It is a “fantastic expression of confidence in this place.”
Fujitsu is said to be suitable for the city, settling is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed in time by the management of the company of his intention.
"Of course we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, friendly contacts could not change the difficulty of the computer manufacturer with the landlord on Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it is a matter of avoiding long non-occupation in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The Rathaus-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> house used by Fujitsu so far, and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" ten years ago, together with the other buildings on the Marienbader-n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, were among the spa town's most discussed construction plans.
Between the railway station and the town hall was created as a joint project of the city and the private designer of the so-called urban entree, which was criticized both for the massive development of areas that previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which at that time was still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the homes.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhein-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, with the largest number of Fujitsu employees in Munich.
A subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt-Niederrad, with Fujitsu Services and TDS as other subsidiaries on the site.
7,000 square meters were rented for this purpose in the Astro Park administration building.
In the complex - his name draws attention to the starry ground plan, which is twenty years old, there is, among others, also a central union of the electrical and electronics industry.
Amazon shuts down server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting into trouble.
Amazon has shut down its detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, a platform for discovery, is coming under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, is scheduled to be detained according to a newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
“Free speech in the land of the free,” activists said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.
Amazon recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic cables to manage a high number of accesses to documents.
Using Twitter, WikiLeaks explained the move: “Okay – we’re going to spend our dollars now by employing people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of expression, “then they should stop selling books.”
Amazon has stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after a team of Senator Joe Lieberman’s co-workers allegedly conducted a search, CNN reported on the basis of information from Lieberman’s office.
The chairman of the Senate Home Defense Committee threatened Amazon with a boycott, the Guardian reported.
“I would have liked Amazon to have taken this step sooner, given the earlier publication of classified information on WikiLeaks,” he said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, has called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries.
“WikiLeaks is acting illegally, indiscriminately and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet,” a nonpartisan senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company — whether American or foreign — should help Wikileaks in their efforts to distribute stolen material.”
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper The Independent, a 39-year-old Australian is being held in the UK, Scotland Yard said to know the exact location.
An internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden an intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"There were even calls to assassinate Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange rightly fears for its security, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently reacted to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, has requested that the person responsible for posting to Wikileaks be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, one adviser to the head of government, Stephen Harper, said on television - ironically, Assange should be "murdered" and Obama could use a "target plane".
Meanwhile, there was a verbal shootout between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange had asked for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s resignation if she was responsible for recently published espionage calls to diplomats.
“I’m not entirely sure why we’re interested in the opinion of one person with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much more important than its website.”
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed as Special Envoy, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing the “necessary structural reforms” that are needed after reports from the embassy were published on WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government has also announced it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they are to be put in danger by publishing on WikiLeaks.
“We did everything we could to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to protect them if necessary."
University of Ice Cream
At "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a slightly obsolete ice cream maker in Czech, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigeration box with a spatula, wipes it into a wafer and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to learn more about ice cream, you will not avoid the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream maker set up an ice cream university to make ice cream from his machines fit the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in our own ice cream shop.
Some want a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, while others venture into the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all continents - from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the future in the country of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars – and Canadian housewife Julia has arrived because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency are decisive.
During his training, Luciano will not forget about the Southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "The Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a notable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients of milk, whipped cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then turn the faucet on the machine and a pasteurized white base cream, the basis of all types of milk ice cream, will flow out.
Immediately, the professor is filled with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a person experiment on his own?
Luciano warns, let himself be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Those who talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" seem to have used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar beans.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will crash and the customer eats all the ice grain.
Certain variations of the basic material are allowed.
It will be more exciting with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the candy department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"You should just experiment."
Be with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with an ice cream from a white base mass that turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa as a base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Now the participants can take a course on ice cream machines.
Luciano lets them always make four different kinds of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment is done with fruit types of ice cream.
The more aromatic substances, the more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Hazelnut ice cream may not taste more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
It’s only when the balanced mixture properly highlights the taste of Gelato, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano removes a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers thereby measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
The production of ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
It is not only the device for automatic production of the basic mass that helps.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools it to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we cannot avoid small accidents.
Brazilian Gustavo will dirty himself and also his colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when a huge blender gets out of his control.
“In every course,” says Maestro Luciano, “it’s only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Auditors in a double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts called Testbiotech, which is considered an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been contracting with the Ilsi Lobbying Association for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been decisively involved in the Efs control regulations for genetic plants and thus stands in a clear conflict of interest, then criticizes.
Efsa’s regulations are said to coincide in entire paragraphs with Ilsi’s documents and thus carry the manuscript of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the office in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from Efsa passed without any additions or transitional periods to the Swiss agricultural concern Syngenta - and thus she changed sides.
Also, the Central German Radio (MDR) recently unveiled the personnel connections between the EU-control agency and the industrial lobby, which aroused interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU lawmakers.
Meanwhile, Efsa cannot recognize a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, i.e. also those from industry, if they are of high professional quality, according to one statement.
Experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It is itself referred to as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics - among other things, to assess the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist's contract.
Independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any attempt at feeding, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
“We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn will do in the field,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not prove reliable results.
"If they're not looking for risks, how can they be found?" asks Then.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees.
She has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area as well as in the US.
Therefore, there are almost no scientists who would not be connected with the companies.
Most studies are not published that are critical to society.
“The industry is controlling security research,” Hilbeck said.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday evening he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It snowed.
The story is known: in September excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands protested against the S21, a billion-dollar reduction of the railway station.
When the construction stopped, most of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000.
Limestone from Crailsheim, a soft coarse stone used between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It says, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and primordial."
When he cut one, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former French Army ammunition depot where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all those that arose during the riots in Stuttgart.
“It would be a shame if they were crushed to gravel or disappeared to a landfill,” he says in his office, a wooden booth that used to be a guardhouse.
He says he was bullied and threatened when it was reported in all newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from a company that was carrying out demolitions.
But he's been talking to S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do the demolition at all.
And when that happens, it's the most sensible thing to do if the stones are still being used.
Then took about 200 S-21-enemies each about 80 kilograms of heavy block, the price for a piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a memory, some also hope to return it in re-construction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, a cargo of 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest sold out a long time ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled what fit into the trunk and onto the trailer.
The quarrelstones of Stuttgart have long since turned into "barbs" or as the edges of flower beds with herbs.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it hadn't been for the political snag."
He gets into his off-road car and rides through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, later biology, then became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of rocks.
He weighs his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest stone merchant in the republic.
It's braking.
In the snow lies artistically processed sandstone.
"They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden," he says.
The sandstone of the Elbe, yellow, warm, is enthusiastic.
"My favorite stone."
We're on our way up through the woods.
Points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the train station in Karlsruhe.
And on.
"Nice travertine."
Once upon a time, these squares belonged to the Neckarstadion tribune in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police presidium in Stuttgart, red granite from the temple of St. Blasien, tuff from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how stones were broken and transported by hand with simple hoisting machines and bull carriages, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were crushed."
He did not become rich, very rich at all.
Today, however, the stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassworker and one gardener settled in the woods.
“We’re working hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the person who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Cologne in the near future.
Stones will also be saved.
Battle of talents for high-potentials
There's a lot of people at the snack bar.
16 students are pressed at the loaves with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the developers of VW, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and just by the way get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as well as VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates in the auditoriums as soon as possible, before they get to the job market and are interested in others.
Since universities do not publish any lists of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practice-oriented projects and gain them.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to gain talent the next day.
A young lady from the personal department distributes pens, rubber teddy bears and plates with the VW logo.
He tells promising young talents about apprenticeship programs, student jobs, and points out the way to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
He sees benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously get to know students, get to know interesting candidates and think about who would be useful as a co-worker."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
But the news is that they are so openly fighting for students.
“Otherwise, it was more of a substantial professional project,” Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is likely to be even tougher.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long pools of applicants.
On the contrary, they must try to attract particularly highly skilled labour.
In particular, graduates of engineering disciplines have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the VDI Association of German Engineers, 40,000 engineering positions remained unoccupied in October.
And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the so-called shortage of engineers will continue to grow.
Roman Dikta goes to KPMG’s auditing and consulting company for talent hunting.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find their way by GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
At the same time, participants can visit KPMG branches and get acquainted with the company.
It will be decided in advance in two rounds who will participate.
Only Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la Cr<0xC3><0xA8>me from many interested will fly to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, increasingly harsh laws will apply under the Dictatorship.
"We want our Race to be different from the others."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
The Dictator's talent hunter seems to be lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
“Some will soon finish their studies and plan to apply for a job with us,” he says.
In addition to direct contact on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labour markets.
"We try to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
“Like Intersolar,” says Sitha Stübe, Head of Personnel at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe is familiar with the issue of young workers.
Currently, there are 35 positions listed on the company’s website.
“At the moment, it is difficult to fill vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is to contact through professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, e.g. the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do a practice or write a thesis."
Solar specialist does not hold any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: a personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
“Large companies often can’t offer that,” says the head of Stübe’s personal department.
Money has not played a major role in finding a job for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good progress options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the top 100 employers in Germany in a Great Place to Work study.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and monitor the framework conditions of employees.
The head of the personal department Stübe hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
"I believe that the interested parties are particularly informed about the external assessments of the potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Employer Branding Academy in Germany advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” she says.
Professionally, this is called internal Employer Branding, i.e. the employer’s enforcement on the market within their own employees.
"Satisfying employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will do advertising on their own to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like playing with a string,” says Kriegler.
Obama to stop new oil drilling
In the coming years, no new oil drillings will occur off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban – and thus definitively canceled earlier plans.
Also before the Atlantic coast, new boreholes have been banned so far.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the drilling rig "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before this disaster, which cost 11 employees their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico to pressure the opposition and industry.
Proponents are trying to reduce the U.S. dependence on oil supplies from abroad.
To date, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy concern BP, which is confronted with billions of requests.
The Obama-appointed commission of inquiry is expected to present the results in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted a drilling ban that had been in place since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling intentions.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with stricter controls and stricter security regulations.
At present, the supervisory authority is fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will drastically reduce the volume of oil mined in the Gulf.
“Government plans are the biggest hurdle to the growth of the gas and oil industry,” according to the BDO survey, ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are shifting until further notice - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned down
The water in the rivers is oily brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaky oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People are fed on stealing, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today you will get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy wandering over his chest with water surrounded by smudges: the scene appears in a watery glow with rainbow colors almost nicely.
The fact that brown oil deposits float beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she had collected enough garnets in containers, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the slowly flowing water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a large amount of oil spilled into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get to the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst contaminated areas in the world.
On the way down the river the mangrove swamps with a lot of side tributaries are only noticeable the entire range of the trigger.
The motor on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves rise from the ground like black sticks of licorice, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are in vain looking for flocks of birds, which are common in humid areas: As soon as the motor on the boat stops, it disperses in an earlier paradise, where it smells like a pump, a terrible silence.
“What’s happening here is ecological warfare,” says sadly Celestine Akpobari: “We live in constant fear of health.”
Comparing it to war is justified.
The area of the Ogoni settlement has been a battlefield for several decades: more than 60 years ago the first conquerors from Europe gathered here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here Shell had to stop its production in 1993, because it was too dangerous for employees.
To this day, the company must not return to the Ogoni region: while the three-sized Delta region of Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining boreholes and 7,000 kilometers of lead of more than two million barrels of black gold is being mined daily, the oil fields in the Ogoni ladem region are too unstable for the concern.
Every few hundred meters they rise from the water of the steel structure like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so they are too tenderly called heads of drilling holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
Every moment such a head of a drilling hole breaks, Akpobari tells, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters of oil spilled into the delta’s ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil spilled into the sea off Alaska in the crash of the Exxon Valdez supertanker 21 years ago is one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There is debate as to who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell calls sabotage and organized theft of oil more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists say cracking headholes and leaky lines are the root cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner complained in 2008: Only the number of wiring failures is “several times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-polluted open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of the many barrels, which are partly connected by a guide, partly arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire burns: an illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel above the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, gasoline leaks out of the line into the catching pot, later kerosene drops at the end of the line, and finally diesel.
In this way, Michael and his four collaborators produce up to four 300-litre barrels a day: “We’ll make 34,000 Naira” — about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta are taking advantage of the chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil state of black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 cents per litre of diesel can still be overstated by illegal producers: because they have the raw material for free.
It comes from the "bunkers" who are connecting to the pipelines everywhere in the Ogoni region: experts say the entire Niger Delta region is losing at least 16 million liters of oil a day.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest share will be filled by organized criminal networks, which are supposed to include politicians and high-ranking military officials, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
Debate whether the disaster was caused by the inhabitants and their interventions or the lax mode of production is considered by activist Akpobari to be purely academic.
“If oil companies were not considered intruders, and if they had not so perfectly destroyed the life of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refinery.”
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so damaged that only the departure of the group is considered: "Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better."
Michael's upset.
"It's high time you disappeared," says the muscular manufacturer.
"The soldiers may come at any moment."
If a special forces unit finds them, they're not in danger of jail, they're in danger of a painful bribe.
Also, the soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw material.
“This damn thing has taken our land in every way to the bottom,” Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous construction error in the engines of the A380
The A380 clearly has a major security flaw.
Investigators found during a search of the machine, which landed in an emergency, a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastrophic failure of the engine".
Qantas is seeking to sue engine makers.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus were apparently more fortunate than previously known on an emergency landing in early November: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380s in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction fault.
A possible defect would have grave consequences: one oil junction could cause cracks due to wear and tear, the ATSB said in a statement released on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It provided a reasoning for the action before the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action against the company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts were released and they damaged the supporting surfaces.
Rolls-Royce says burning oil is the cause of the damage.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines in question.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety gap was considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced an A380 engine as a safety precaution.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National Snowfall Causes Chaos in Transportation
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and planes are interfering.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: almost the entire republic has sunk on Thursday night at freezing temperatures in the snow – leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
On several highways and many roads, transport is severely restricted.
At the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the new snow.
In addition, there was a strong impact wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects a stormy storm on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the morning, with the state of the water 1.2 meters above normal.
Snowflakes have caused significant problems on motorways and state roads in Saxony.
According to the Central Weather Service, the alert level in Saxon Switzerland was violet, the highest in the world.
Part of it was 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds causing hail.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities reported major road problems.
On the A2 the wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
In Thuringia there were snow problems on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railways, there are major difficulties in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the tracks or broken top lines and switches.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Thuringia, Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Munich.
On the train, 165 passengers were given wool blankets, food and drink from firefighters and rescuers.
The snow was blowing across the road.
Many flights at major German airports have been cancelled due to snow.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information office, cancelled flights have already been reported from Munich.
According to Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt.
Road maintenance is in constant use.
Although few passengers remain unconnected at the airport, 400 field beds are ready for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg because of the snowy road: there was also a truck caught at the railway crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning over on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have good news: snow will remain in the form of light powder, and therefore it will rise even in light gusts of wind.
But the wind's getting weaker.
Only in the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the strength of a storm.
But it will be very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for buyers for two towers with offices at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could be worth up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just refurbished its headquarters: twin towers in the Frankfurt banking district have been modernized; meanwhile, bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
Now, however, apparently, the financial concern wants the renovation costs back again - and is looking for buyers for both skyscrapers, according to the Financial Times Deutschland, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
“We are constantly exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it again,” he said.
The largest credit institution in Germany is relinquishing its corporate headquarters after a short time.
The bank only took over the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from investors in its own fund and then refurbished them costly.
According to the data, the energy conversion has swallowed about 200 million euros.
Selling would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, experts estimate the value of the towers that have been renamed "Greentowers" at a price of about 500 million euros.
The spokesman said it was not clear whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people have honored the memory of buried miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
It has not yet been possible to rescue the dead, as the security situation in the shaft continues to be complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at Pike River Mine near Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were trapped in the mine.
A probe was launched into the shaft where the accident occurred, but it found no trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of poisonous gases and subsequent explosions, the rescue forces could not come down for safety.
After the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts proceeded from the fact that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
He still hasn't been able to rescue the dead.
Now they honored the memory of dead relatives and friends.
In Greymouth, New Zealand, 10,000 people gathered in sunny weather.
They remained silent for two minutes.
29 tables were built to honor the memory of the miners, with helmets, lanterns and miners’ names on them.
Also pictures and personal belongings, such as clothes and surfboards have found their place here.
There were flags waving half-mast on state government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped the miners would come out of the "deep ground" again, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key said.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemoration.
British and South African miners were also flooded during the November 19 explosion.
Rescuers started by putting out a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the poisonous gases are dissolved, it will begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Is horror a good fit for an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to rediscover his old battle epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he was filming “Walhalla Rising”?
A captive Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his opponents with almost supernatural force - it sounds ideal for young men looking for bloody actions, because our hero helps himself with cruel methods of killing and even fights his enemies with guts and guts.
On the other hand, the One-Eyed, as it is actually called, does not say a word during the whole film, and the other characters will utter at most one or two sentences or let themselves be dragged to the agonizing dying cries.
Otherwise, they are silent and thriving in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera shots.
It’s good when the film has multiple target groups, it’s just a shame when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy about drug dealers "Pusher", is considered the Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to bring his works more humorous to the mainstream or less brutal to the artistic audience.
Most fans of art cinema seem to be discouraged by the splashing brains and guts everywhere.
Supporters of action films get bored at the latest when the One-Eyed goes to Jerusalem with a group of violent Christian missionaries, and hangs in the wind and fog for eternity before the crew arrives in America and remains silent.
It’s no wonder that Walhalla Rising didn’t make it to the movies in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
It is a pity, mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the peculiar facade, sometimes with blood, there is an exciting cinema that deserves a little attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or the exact plot, it's all about the atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a movie.
There is no escape for the viewer.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his frosty shots and gloomy hypnotic soundtrack, especially but indescribable hatred that bursts from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Eyed will keep something like innocence, all the rest are driven by anger.
Out of all, the most one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, who will become a time for enemies and temporary allies, a warrior from hell, perhaps the messenger of the devil.
It represents destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The IAEA has new warnings about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country is resisting expression - and will not even allow control.
Around midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 km away and is called Dair as-Saur.
In the documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), her name appears when it comes to the reactor allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
Based on the US-US Foreign Intelligence Service’s announcement at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited for the production of plutonium – from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technique of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she explained where the components of the reactor could have been before the destruction, it was supposed to be a small copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, photographs were presented that showed the building from close up or even from inside.
The reactor was said to have been in place shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, we don’t know much more than we did back then, even the riddles have gotten bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently published in his memoirs that the CIA was very confident before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in al-Kibar, but basically had no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence officials in Europe are even more cautious and only speak of a “supposed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “reliable.”
They lack clear evidence, just like the IAEA.
Asked how confident he is that he has a reactor ahead of him, a senior U.N. diplomat said last summer that the IAEA “has enough material to ask questions.”
The rubble of the allegedly "unused military building" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and also properly leveled the terrain.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received through a member state satellite photos of commercial sellers from the time just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market because they were exclusively bought by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program, nor has it ever built a reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, he forbade the auditors from having a second inspection in el-Kibar and from having access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said.
The investigation into the case has been going on in vain since June 2008 and is “growing into a serious problem due to the credibility of the office,” as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA’s headquarters in Vienna admitted – a serious breach of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty that the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers the key to progress on the matter to be three additional facilities that are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor - and unlike it, they still exist.
However, the auditors have not yet indicated which devices are in question, what function they have or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to them as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C. (Isis) identified the objects and found a complex of buildings on satellite images, which is probably one of the suspect objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - for exactly this reason, Syria rejects the IAEA's access to these three sites.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent in advance to the United States to search for military bases.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the facility by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has evidence and satellite images of material being transported back and forth between these three sites and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said that at least one furnished should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is no “evidence of any sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment and reprocessing; the processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by uranium, which is not enriched.
But where that uranium comes from and where it would later be decomposed of plutonium per bomb, there are only likely estimates of these central questions.
It is also not known whether the debris, which could hide important traces, are stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of freight wagons had vanished from the surface of the earth, no one seemed to have any information as to where the rubble had gone.
Just a few kilometers from el-Kibar and on the other side of Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria had inspected in 1998 as a suitable storage facility for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley linked it to the reactor in a satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane’s Intelligence Review.
But images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out ground work at all suspected sites and removed large containers.
It might have been a coincidence, but it didn't help to clear the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles are talking about the fact that the IAEA has spent many months creating a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - only this effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
In the meantime, Damascus has rejected the proposal.
If even a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed and that the thing was not burning, for several months now US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, has already spoken about the "opportunity to which I lean in the future", but he is hesitant.
This option poses a great risk: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love in time of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on a still-unnamed directorial debut this summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes restlessness.
There is a persistent rumor that the Muslim woman will fall in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, so the planned filming was quickly moved from Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN refugee agency UNHCR Jolie and asked to meet with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is also the UN refugee agency's ambassador.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women meetings in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There were no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie's attitude to the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization, therefore, recommended the UN refugee relief organization to release Jolie as ambassador, the Guardian reported.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which received her script for reading, allowed for filming after minor drags in Sarajevo - it is not clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted herself with great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains uncertain.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and they meet again when she, as a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp, where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that the film Jolie really begins before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being exerted on her, which is "unfair and based on false information".
Now she can be rescued by hackers from Hollywood: by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times before.
Nothing but gone
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
No sign of grief.
The home team dominates significantly over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout with joy at the sound of loud music, ass-footed.
The Bailey-Pub in Cork, South Ireland, is boiling as players throw tennis balls at a distance of three meters into beer cups - and they hit.
"Beer Pong" is called a bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning bonus, plus tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shouting beer game and a reticent computer scientist, it doesn't get along very well.
Still, the 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to get away from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not a gambling passion in Las Vegas, he goes to an interview in New Zealand in January.
“I have such a strange feeling,” he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she immediately got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," the young man says and smiles.
Due to bad prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: As with the Tanners, it looks like a lot of families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will leave the country in the near future, according to experts from the ESRI Science Institute for Economics and Social Affairs in Dublin.
It is estimated that by 2015 there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar emigration wave as Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upsurge that has brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now once again spreading.
The economic crisis is particularly troubling for the young, educated Irish people, who have so far only experienced an upsurge.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was in need, money was scarce.
Three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
There are many letters from readers in the Irish Times complaining: "In Ireland, everything goes uphill."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one please turn off."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, says the government is only deceiving and offers no prospects for the future for young people.
“They’re reducing the minimum wage, but they don’t have a strategy to create jobs,” she said.
She observes her classmates wandering from one unpaid practitioner to another.
Her biggest worry is that she'll have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the topic positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a complete service on the topic of work abroad.
“For beginners in the labor market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder,” says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O'Donovan has known for six months what it's like to build something somewhere else.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no job in Ireland, he is now employed along with 15 Irish colleagues on a construction site in Germany.
He's just building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he continues to Hannover or Berlin for another project.
Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely gets home because he works extra shifts to pay off a home loan.
“Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy,” she says when she crosses the threshold of her own house for the first time in a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany on a house in Ireland where I'm basically not at all."
He laughs embarrassingly and walks through cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, large expensive cars are parked in the entrances.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by a loan.
“It was a crazy time, simple money was without many questions,” he says.
Are you worried that your loan might not work out well?
O'Donovan thinks for a moment, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The construction engineer doesn't like the grievances he hears so often.
"No one has to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while working abroad, that's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe we'll feel like Irish after that."
He laughs and then tells the story of his father, who left for England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back, and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and simply wait for how life will develop elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years, and why shouldn’t that be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there’s one more thing he’s quite concerned about these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she's gonna turn up at the bachelor party.
"No emotions at all," he says, and drinks a beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a celebration of leaving, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common Practices of Democracy
The promotion of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the promotion of private enterprise.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobar<0xC3><0xB3>metro survey, which took place in 18 countries and was published exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been held regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, is dominated by two related things.
The first is that Latin America has a rather cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the outskirts of the Pacific in South America (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% annually since 2002, democracy support has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in output last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democrats, drawing the regional average (see Chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in their country, the same number as last year, but a large increase compared to 2001, when it was 25% (Figure 3).
Roughly 34% said they trust parliament in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, democracy in Latin America was undermined by the economic crisis.
Support arose during the global financial crisis, probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and fell again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies across a wide range from ground to ground (see Chart 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Roughly 31% say that either they themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% last year and also the lowest number since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in growing support for private enterprise and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage rose from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela share the same view (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing president Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the leading country in the region, as 19% of respondents mentioned (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical Elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections were filled with ballot boxes and repetitive ballots, ballots scattered across the canals, shattered polling stations, and intimidation.
Electoral rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many who moved because of the January earthquake, wandered around trying to figure out where they could go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged forerunners, have shouted fraudulently and called for an end to the election.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said: “In many ways, this was a pretty good election.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are due to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestine, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive duel is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
The two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, former First Lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is labeled by the election commission for having achieved a decisive duel.
Due to the rampant cholera epidemic and more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but were prevented from doing so because of disorganization.
About 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that Haitians will do it on their own.
On the tips to the center
In the weeks since she was suddenly widowed, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the Argentine president, has benefited from public sympathy when her popularity rose from 20 to over 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in the next year’s elections may depend on Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s grieving renunciation of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
Everything will be based on these signs.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued in economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, had a habit of budgeting that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez's government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner in a heart attack on 27 October.
Some members of the ruling political movement Peronist joined Mrs Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (in which the government was slapped and accused of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply next year, with the president spending more space at will.
The economy is overheating: up to 9% is likely to grow this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and trade unions are talking about a figure close to 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was suffering from an economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction, rather than on inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector and cleared the INDEC, a statistical agency that has gone on to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez moderate this policy now?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the growth of world prices for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is making it clear that she wants to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government made an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez faces an agreement with creditor governments that are grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes approximately $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact be kept out of the IMF’s sight, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer price index that would resemble an introduction to cleaning the INDEC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez will want to remain in politics after her term ends when her husband is no longer at her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs the support of the middle class, which is tired of kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will decline.
If she wants to win the next election, she will have to decide whether it is not necessary to quietly renounce the many views her husband held in politics.
Half-Encouragement for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, voted on 27 November for mayors and city councils in five city districts, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have prevailed towards the mainland and are strongly embedded in business relations, including the Partly Free Trade Agreement, in the largest settlement of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but only closely.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three out of five mayoral offices, it failed to win by a majority vote.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater Taiwan independence, won almost 50% of the total vote against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, the share of his party’s votes has decreased by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party, together with the KMT, was in the city councils.
Elections were held like most of Taiwan’s elections, which include noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags of poorly dressed girls.
There was even a mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the KMT, was campaigning for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot the young Mr. Lien over his face, wounded him, and killed the viewer.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the gunman intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the election, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the mainland itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates argued over plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
The KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP also abandoned the incitement of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a reaction to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing can be expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in sequence.
It is better to wait for this after the presidential election in 2012.
In any case, the DPP has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a rebel and a proponent of clear independence.
But under Ms. Tsai’s leadership, a new generation has developed that is moderate, and the DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry with this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they insisted that Taiwan was an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr. Chen’s intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is authorized to search for its own people.
Mr Ma's assessments were poor, despite the rapid pace of economic growth; the KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will reorganize his cabinet as well as local branches.
Strongly promoted proposals to support Taiwan in establishing friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, the majority of Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "the point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speeches at the request of the President and the people must be noticed.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer whom President Obama chose to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is named one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a nomination in the Best New Artist category.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" was released, the nomination came a little late, but it is in line with Grammy rules, where an artist must not release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly took a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hand with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success that in 2003 recorded this Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for voting in the Grammy-like category.
Elsewhere, the Grammy judges rightly praise the Vijay Iyer Trio's "History" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing album ride that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against experienced saxophonist James Moody's album "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a hoarse New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" program, has been awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise in favor of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber's albums.
The wild band Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with steampunk knowledge has won several well-deserved recognitions in the category of large ensembles, with the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still the brave Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how a bassist can have a free hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey Lead in Classical Music
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards.
Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California appeared the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was commissioned through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, operatic, choral and solo recordings.
The category for Classical Music Producer of the Year has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album were given to Bruckner and his Symphony Nos. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his Deus Ex Symphony by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his Dreamhouse by the Boston Modern Orchestras Project and Synergy.
In terms of the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion of Shchedrin and "The Enchedrin and "The Enchester".
The Grammy-nominated composers include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for an instrumental performance by a soloist with an orchestra.
The composer from L.A. said he wrote a 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed at a New York-based concert with the Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it with the help of tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists this year, only women were represented, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classics transition category, she was nominated by soprano Jessye Norman for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mosque in Temecula receives the approval of the planning committee
The planned mosque in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public testimony.
Critics have attacked the project, saying it promotes terrorism and will lead to a trade suspension.
However, the jurors decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center was in line with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whomever you remember," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said on Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of this as an American citizen."
"It means that justice will always prevail."
"Opposition is minimal," he added.
"Those who are against only shout out loud."
"We have really good people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was spent discussing with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper’s website.
"America no longer exists," one comment appeared.
"We are the Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of about 135 families had lived in Riverside County for years without incident, but he wanted a larger and more suitable space than the storage space he had rented together with the filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council about the project.
Microbes with resistance to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the scope for finding new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has options that stand outside the main elements that have been considered so far and basic.
"This organism has a double ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This is a very strange fact, but it is not proof that it is some form of truly 'alien' life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared Thursday in the online edition of Science magazine.
For a long time, it was considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You'll be amazed at what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, a co-author of the report.
This finding is significant in the search for life beyond Earth, as researchers must be able to recognize life and know what life might look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report about this novelty published to be discussed, which did not disclose the details of the finding, has prompted widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to exploit other elements that drive biochemistry and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the substitution of one element by another element in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accidental finding.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she thought that the microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace each other.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, organisms are very difficult to separate these elements from one another."
"However, arsenic is so different that it does not work like phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it begins to work in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which the bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better when exposed to phosphorus, but because they can also survive with arsenic replacement, there is an increased possibility that a life form that uses arsenic may appear naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there has never been an example of this.
Arsenic was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it might have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there may have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The remaining stolen dogs were found in Compton.
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from the Bellflower motel were found, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said on Thursday.
Four show dogs - two Akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis - went missing on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the other two dogs were found on Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles area police department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to say exactly where the dogs were found, in what location, nor did he share detailed information about their finding.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available to comment on the case.
They were very happy when their two Akitas found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, a three-year-old dog named Trace and a 10-month-old female named Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who were planning to participate in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unaccounted for until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to participate in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship on Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
Other dogs should have competed in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a nearly month-long trip of a couple on dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took with them three dogs — a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Bretagne hound — who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh left the corgis in the car, where it was supposed to be cooler.
They opened the windows a bit so that the dogs had plenty of fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported the car stolen at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning.
Peek said he would offer a reward to anyone who leads them to missing dogs. Dogs have microchips implanted to identify them.
It was not clear on Thursday whether the prizes would be awarded.
Lion is ready to shout again now that MGM restructuring gets final approval from court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt and clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company that focuses on producing and producing movies and TV shows.
Thursday’s decree that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy order leaves MGM with no legal impediments to restarting Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of the slack studio.
The number of employees will fall to about 320 from the original more than 400.
MGM will not emerge abruptly from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to fund new MGM operations and production.
Now it is a merger with an investment bank that itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve their finances, as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, Chairman Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, the former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to solve MGM’s financial difficulties and the 140 creditors of the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to put the company up for sale by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially resurfaces from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, receive a reward for success, the so-called "success fee" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which has released only one film this year and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to contribute to the financing of two films, modeled on the book "The Hobbit", together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its stake in the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debts, was looking to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Technological Toys That Will Keep Your Gift Budget Balanced
The leading candidate this year is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by a video game system, but in both cases it is a significant impact on the gift budget.
Consider that for the price of one iPad you can buy five BMX wheels for $99 and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads jumpers or approximately 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers — Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us, and BJ's Wholesale Club — and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law was working; this year’s technology toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, compared to previous years.
While there are relatively fewer new toys with affiliate sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices quoted are from Toys "R" Us, except as otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their tummy.
At one press, the animal releases a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start squeezing, you can't stop.
The best choice in singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years old)
Last year, at Elmo Live Technology, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll that can play Simon Says and can also walk the moon thanks to its innovative folding foot with wheel locking.
Children test a toy by a Mickey dance instructor, although their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you’re a kid in the 80s, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computer learning toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn a car ride into fun working with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you’re looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for kids 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest easy-to-use version, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don't have as effective teaching as Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids 3 to 12 years old), the first major Leapster change from Leapfrog, with a newer and brighter display.
No version is compatible with older units.
Fisher-Price's iXL (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years old) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are no bigger than a box of matches, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the cubes in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised word making.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two toys, Webkinz and Club Penguin, were represented in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child a toy online from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or a Puffle animal.
A little larger than your toothbrush brush is the Hexbug Nano ($10, for children from 5 years), the latest in a series of microrobots on a button battery.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It’s fun to make a maze of cubes and see if he can find his way out.
It is also very resistant.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
The introduction of finer police control in China
As an urban military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly checking his orders and issuing orders half-voiced with military authority.
He wanted the female members - China's powerful enforcers of the urban order, feared and despised for their hard interventions and their passion for violence - to convey a certain impression on the crowd around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering silently, "what pretty girls look like!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and trousers stood out.
Four pairs of black shoes are arranged according to the ruler.
The four headgear fits perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
'Personally, I think they look average, 'said Mr. Tang contemptuously.
"Models are nice."
More than one government has sought to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered the new goalkeepers to have a college education.
The province of Guangdong has changed the grey-green uniforms to the supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced staring at it with heavy armament: In 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded the cart with snacks and stared at the owner until the housekeeper packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose the operation as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its municipal police with 13 women, who were selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and young age.
The goal is to show, in addition to the rough side of the police, also a more subtle, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson herself would have difficulty getting into the secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce the city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely captures a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat a non-participating viewer to death after using his mobile phone to film their actions in a protest against the landfill.
Last year, the training of police officers was held in Beijing, the manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. In the manual, among other things, there was a description of how to effectively beat the offender without signs of blood.
This year, a watermelon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered a left-brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan scared the government,” China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after another discussion of tactics.
There was a "really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say this approach is not enough.
After the district advertised interest in eight new female police officers in October, an editor of The Beijing Evening News addressed the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female applicants between the ages of 18 and 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than the average - that is, higher than 1.6 meters.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials say the job is too mentally demanding for women over the age of 25.
“Their image is an important thing,” said one unnamed police officer on Rednet.com, as if a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration, strongly disagrees with this description.
But he noted that higher education requirements are also common in China for other jobs, for both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
This means that the issue of good looks is a subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He can't let a lame or humpful man serve with us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who guards Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, with apple-like faces and a finely shaped mouth.
She doesn’t think the emphasis on her appearance could be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her collaborator with the mines, 21-year-old Xu Yang, says, “Our job is to represent the image of the city.”
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just driving traders into the alleys where they can do their job.
Every morning, the group confronts more than ten marketers who run on foot or on bicycles and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before being driven out.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We've told you so many times before!" said Miss Xu, as the merchant began to run, leaving his wheel with the noodle cart for a while.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than tedious.
“Every day is basically the same thing,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her freelance marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts to confiscate goods from sellers.
They can only threaten to report this fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after false rumors spread that police officers had killed a salesman.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far escaped such violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only scarcely.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police were patrolling that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as much as he wanted.
15-minute distance from the police, looking angry, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who have only an auxiliary role to play.
Unlike them, they are not educated in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
'Sometimes we fight physically, 'said Mr. Li.
"Most of the time, it's the public who's going to start it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges relating to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure the lobby, the senator's lawyers said on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who was, until the scandal, considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012. His affair got into the national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “delighted” by the decision, which followed almost a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary action at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that there is no plan to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The decision came as a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who argued that there was substantial evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents published in the New York Times in October 2009 stated that Mr. Ensign was helping Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, being silent about the senator’s relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr Hampton and to support their views after they have hired Mr Hampton to lobby for them, as documents and interviews say.
Since Hampton had been Mr. Ensign's assistant until recently, he was excluded from lobbying by law from his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual settlement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared to contradict the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence that was published, “it turned out that this is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department was cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of setbacks, including last year’s decision to suspend the lawsuit against former Senator Ted Stevens amid charges of state misconduct.
Federal prosecutors “clearly concealed the weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a legal group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensign.
“This basically indicates that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the law,” she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign’s chief lawyer, said in an interview that he had been called by the Attorney General of the Department of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and had been told that the Department had found no charges against his client.
Mr Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to specify the legal arguments he had handed over to the public prosecutors.
"I'm not comfortable describing the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which an ethical group alleges that Ensign’s parents’ payment of $96,000 to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began to work as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he had "blown" the Department of the Interior on the subject under discussion.
Mr Ensign also attended lunch with Mr Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and invited the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after they had hired Mr Hampton to work as a lobbyist.
When the scandal was first reported last year, Mr Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of the crime investigation, his spokesman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department and end the entire investigation.
“Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing her hard work on behalf of the Nevadan people,” she said.
Cheshire appeals to Twitter
Half a dozen of them wrote in the ranks of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, reports of horrific testimony were sent via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says more than 140,000 tweets were about raping and tying children to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire citizens, a Connecticut family, was scheduled for an official termination with the imposition of the death penalty, for which the jury voted.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that would likely have occupied the court for years.
One of the most provocative is that intense reporting on the process - including the widespread use of Twitter by mainstream reporters - created a "circus atmosphere" and this widespread, imminent penetration of information with outrageous details then introduced a jury in a decision in the sense of influencing public opinion.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, to also require new rules in the courtroom.
“As I have seen in this trial, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the rights of a fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Mr Hayes’s attorney-general.
The judge Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the state briefly rejected the allegations regarding last week’s ruling, saying that the media had been “carefully controlled” and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury had acted under public influence.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, courts have recognized that reporting notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the United States Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when he said in his ruling that in the case of Sheppard v. Maxwell, the media trial was a "carnival atmosphere".
Some believe that this crime was the inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers have said that appeals courts that reviewed Hayes’s verdict half a century later might be surprised by the argument that new rules could be needed to determine how to communicate from courtrooms, which was unimaginable in Dr. Sheppard’s case.
“There is a general reason to be concerned about the impact of new media,” said John J. Donohue III, a Stanford Law School professor who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was exercised arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some judges may be interested in the idea that limiting direct communication from courtrooms can make the process fairer.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined by Mr Hayes’ lawyers who would be able to argue for years to delay the execution of the verdict.
Lawyers also argue that Mr. Hayes’ case may be biased when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal horror photographs when selecting a jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, which became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michael, 11.
Advocates say they will also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty and claim that the judge wrongly recalled a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to reflect on the weekend.
The judges were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process may attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict made last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly fanning the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily rush of media, cameras and reporters in court,” the lawyer wrote, “was something that has never been seen here in New Haven before and is perhaps also a national rarity.”
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists argued that immediate reporting was more outrageous than later reports, and from their point of view, the judicial police should manage the scope of other trials.
But some lawyers have demanded appeals courts with frequently used arguments that social and technological changes require court adjustments.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision on Dr. Sheppard's verdict, because of the breadth of the process, and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy overcome the abyss?
After a campaign that was notable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of courtesy emerged in Washington this week.
Is this the first swallow of real cooperation between two political parties or just an illusory moment before a quick return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and parliamentary leaders has not yielded any major breakthroughs on the crucial issues that need to be discussed during the meeting.
In any case, it was a polite discussion about the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party zeal.
Wednesday's public meeting of the president's deficit commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close cooperation for several months has built mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide that still divides members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a trial period - they are sounding signs of collegiality and compromise to each other, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants were carried out with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too wide and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it’s about taxes, spending, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November elections were prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They are inevitable after the election.
The elections stirred up the emotions of the party, and then they fell silent.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the session, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts have expired at the end of the year, and no one sees it as favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a likely compromise on unemployment benefits is only because Republicans can’t look at how they support tax cuts for the wealthy, while the unemployed are denied unemployment benefits.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is already greater optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new opening treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on fundamental issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, it is a likely period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After the things that need to be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is largely widespread - that politeness will lead to real cooperation.
“I look at everything between now and 2012 as a shadow boxing game when the main events take place in 2012,” he said.
The reasons are largely due to the formation of the new Republican majority in the White House and the tea parties voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing that they must act on their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These support lines are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and cutting spending.
Joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, in their view, to exert pressure on the deficit issue to public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to present their plan as an official recommendation and fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury, who suggest that, in the case of financial issues, at least today, we have little basis or will to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, with Republicans calling on Obama to address the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party co-operation.
What causes the shift?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that, despite being partisan in the last election, most Americans still want to see two parties working together.
If it could go to the heel, as it did in 1995, then both sides will be watching the public’s reactions very closely.
Anyone who is threatened with a vote cut is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of the matter.
The partyism and direction is greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that a greater ideological divide has been created between Obama and the parliamentary Republicans than it was in the case of the Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that emerged this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground in the issues that still divide them.
U.S. leaked document depicts Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city’s governance is in the hands of a “kleptocracy” and continues to be a part of the bribery and protection bribery that comes on the way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in a February record.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service largely hold protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal transactions, but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertical of the office” – will take its toll as the money starts to move up the ladder.
The recording, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on their website on Wednesday via WikiLeaks.
The record is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
He was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only observe minimal changes in the purge.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption for many years, and won several lawsuits for false accusations for such accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about evidence of corruption: “It’s crazy, it’s dirt, it’s shit.”
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupt, it will turn out to be in the polls.
However, it is unusual to encounter such details uttered in such a way, in an embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“The Moscow city government and its links to criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government functions more like a kleptocrat than a government,” the report says.
“Criminal elements enjoy the so-called ‘krysha’ (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means ‘roof’ or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Prosecutor’s Office, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy of the city of Moscow.
"Analytics have identified a three-stage structure in the criminal world of Moscow."
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"Federal Security, Interior Ministry and militia are on second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the biggest companies and the police are targeting smaller businesses.
One source said, “Moscow business owners realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Interior Ministry (rather than from organized criminal groups), as they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer on course."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself may already be in trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay fast enough, their stores are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev has repeatedly spoken about the fight against corruption, but admitted that he has made little progress.
The embassy report talks about men taking suitcases, probably stuffed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," Georgi Satarov, director of Moscow's Indem research team, said in a recent interview.
“It’s part of the bureaucracy.”
“They are not part of the political class because there are no more political classes in Russia.”
Without politicians, without opposition, without power-sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that nationwide corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the US embassy report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not arouse enthusiasm among the Russian government, although only to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue about the solution of the problem.
In a CNN interview with Larry King, Putin said that the documents WikiLeaks published may have been fakes and reacted angryly to the statement that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole issue is that it is about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethical."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a poorly lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the “slaughterer” for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge state in northwestern Cambodia remains popular, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is also broken in Anlong Veng.
In April, victims at the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks explaining for the first time the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian Court jointly upheld the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, the verdict of the former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such advance, there was growing unrest among Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their attempts to rejoin Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that is investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla wars from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which culminated in the surrender of Ieng Sara in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who persisted, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouge have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak, like unskilled farmers.
“These people have benefited from capitulation only minimally,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which runs public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were raised with no idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok fed them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing trial of the Khmer Rouge has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Che, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court is mandated to prosecute the head of the representative and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in the four cases.
It was not enough to calm the fears in Anlong Venge.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was a district leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced laborers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chae returned from field work to her wooden house on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to descend and shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there are further prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court looked for other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means sticking broken pieces together," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The center has published the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, with 75 pages and the title "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addition to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student at Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be prosecuted."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and courtrooms are starting to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains is a road overgrown with weeds and sprinkled with discarded plastic bags, which leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who was ashes at the place.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its uranium-based weapons stockpile
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that it would give up its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after a security summit between Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
For years, the U.S. government has been trying to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seemed that they hit the cliff last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that in the past two months, several clandestine operations have been carried out with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, as it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was scrapped.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to a subsequent summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a nuclear security group.
Clinton called the deal a “very important, important step” from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all of their reserves of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be 7th.
A dozen countries have done so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama summit on nuclear safety, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never give up its uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity... We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus a few months ago joined the United States and expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it to supply the Belarusian research institute with less enriched uranium, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on a trust basis,” said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium for weapons production.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will seek to eliminate its reserves by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that more consistent respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not make any jewels with the CIA flights
The Spanish government was not making any jewels regarding CIA flights carrying imprisoned Taliban and Al-Qaeda members to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo through Spanish territory, the US ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is according to documents provided by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is also written that the then First Deputy Prime Minister Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega requested that the Spanish executive be informed so that "she could show that she has proper supervision over foreign aircraft flying through Spanish airspace".
In June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe accusing a dozen states, including Spain, of complicity in human rights violations, a meeting was held between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's announcement "put Zapatero's government out of the game" and insisted Spain had nothing to hide in the matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain had no problem with intelligence flights across its territory.
"They just want to be informed" so that they are not "caught unprepared," Aguirre said in one of the documents.
Foreign Minister Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos also suggested to the US ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give the matter the lowest possible outlines, but because the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence".
In February 2007, Attorney General Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez told the Embassy that, as far as he was concerned, he had no intention of blocking the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Department of Defense relating to CIA flights.
“This information does not contain any incriminated file or any sensitive information,” the embassy said in an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. has expressed concern about "clear coordination between a Spanish judge and German prosecutors" rather than about declassifying information from the CNI or the Department of Defense.
“This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of a luncheon between U.S. Ambassador and Interior Minister Alfred Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate," he had already instructed his co-workers to "avoid rozho with commentary"
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech: People's Party) on this issue.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party of the Popular will not hesitate to take advantage of any indications that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have negative consequences for the United States government,” he said.
The confessed mother-murderer complained on the network about the mother's "care"
A young woman was talking about the baby when it was already dead, and she had her own blog: "Terror in Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend, both from the village of Noia in the region of La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, from which the young woman comes.
The reports are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the woman's emotional life, which ABC reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez in 1998.
They dated for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn baby was his, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do a DNA test.
She soon found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen one was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence took a long time.
The little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palma.
However, the content of her communication shows that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca and wrote: "Alberto is kind of pissed off that I left for work."
"When I told him that, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes that he has to be with the little one all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about the text message she just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send your child.”
He complains, “If he doesn’t like me leaving the baby with my mother, I’ll marry him when I get back,” he says.
In May, he says of his return to his residence: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until 19, because I have to go to work on the 20th so that I do not lose this place."
He explains that if all goes well, he will take his son to his home.
"He's going to be with who he's supposed to be, me, and it's never going to happen again in my life that I'd leave him with anyone other than my mother," a dubious intent given her bad relationship.
There is another contribution in July.
By tapping this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is satisfied on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand, he's with me and he's quite fond of it here, but on the other hand, he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to go to summer school, so I'll save some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to e-mail, look what he wants, he'll meet with me, sex is necessary."
On the thirtieth, another report: "The boy is fine, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a message about Victor, the current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet, Monika's posts are on blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she would call herself a "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Terror in Galician (motto)."
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regrets and feels guilty.
She doesn’t want to believe that everything happened because she didn’t tell him she was a single mother.
Yesterday, M<0xC3><0xB3>nica entered the provincial penitentiary in Palma, where she arrived from the detention center in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before that, however, she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are asking for a psychiatric evaluation.
People would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main say in the city halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes received and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (People’s Party of Catalonia) already has the idea of general elections, whether there is an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes in such national elections is usually for the national elections.
In 2008, the Catalan People's Party won 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the 2006 autonomous elections the number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (People's Party of Catalonia) won 384,091 votes.
If this tendency to increase, which was supported at least by the transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the electors of the PP, would be lost by the party's analysts (the party's 10 votes), they calculated that if the general elections were held, the PPC could win 12 deputies in the Chamber, compared to the existing 8, the party of the CiU (Convergencia i Uni<0xC3><0xB3>, Czech: Soda i <0xC5><0x88>a - unie)
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis, the ERC (Left-Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now it has three - while the ICV (Green Initiative for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, possibly winning another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next docking will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the socialists in the four main provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona), which is one of the administrations with the largest projected budget - 2011 for 661 million euros.
Both the Nationalists and the Popularists agree that the PSC could lose the city halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not get a majority and would not even be able to turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representation - as it needs to get at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes received in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnaround in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
Lidovci also won at other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
She currently has representation in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
A Catalan cell has provided al-Qaeda with thousands of passports.
In addition to seven arrests in Barcelona, three others were arrested in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona in 2008, were a jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of Al-Qaeda, including the "Tigers of the Liberation of Tamil <0xC3><0x8D>lam" and "Lashbakar-e" respectively.
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of the matter, aims to ensure, through the "Operation Kampai", the weakening of the counterfeit Al-Qaeda apparatus at the international level and "to limit its operational capabilities".
Investigators estimate that the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand during the two years it was active in Catalonia, where they were then forged and then delivered to groups that make up the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy so that their “fighters” could travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active jihadist network in Europe, so other European police units were also involved in these investigations in addition to Thai services, and it cannot be excluded that in the coming days there will not be similar interventions in other European countries as in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Zemayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad, and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained) another developed in Thailand, during which they were detained by Muh<0xC3><0xA1>n P.
It was these men who ran a cell based in Bangkok, Spain, and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was dismantled in 2009, stole passports that met Islamist demands.
This means that the documents had to belong to men aged 25 to 45 years, had to be valid for several years and were without marked visas.
The investigation documents stress that there are no known facts linking those detained in Catalonia to the bombing in Bombay, although the author of the attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it is worth noting that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency, which were “put in” for the purchase of cards in mobile phones, which were later used by members of the “command”, which killed 106 people.
Police have seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands that Maso stop the fiscal agreement
The leader of the PPC (People’s Party of Catalonia) Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Artur Mas her conditions under which she is willing to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign, and their priority is to revitalize the economy and relinquish risky businesses such as the economic ones.
The Catalan People’s Party president arrived at a meeting with Artur Mas with the confidence of the 18 seats received in last Sunday’s election, a number more than satisfactory for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs at least one of the opposition formations to abstain from voting on his appointment to office.
Future alliances, which the nationalists would like to maintain in the House when the general elections are held, depend on a possible agreement with the PP, but so far the talks that Mas is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried out in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president, in order to get her support for her appointment, "she will have to put an end to all sovereign and liberation speeches", as well as to an economic agreement - similar to the one in the Basque Country - about which the CiU leader even wanted to have a vote in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the overburdened political apparatus of the autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations regarding Mas’s inauguration will be dealt with within the PP’s Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat parties.
Mas has already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who has promised tough opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV), and today he will meet with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Alberto Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur due to "lack of measures"
The performances of the Olot Center do not exclude that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) Geriatric Center provided a press conference yesterday to describe the damage done to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors in his care.
Joan Sala, the director of the facility, accompanied by the facility’s lawyer, Joan Canada, said that “the wish of La Caritat’s home would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit” responsible for the killing, but “lawfulness and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities.”
In addition to the reputational damage that this institution may suffer from failing to detect the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, a major threat to the home of La Caritat is now the material compensation requirements already calculated by the legal representatives of the families of the survivors.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime took place in August 2009 and that he has not stopped killing since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of the eight bodies of the clients of the home for the elderly, with the suspicion that in many cases the deceased were not examined by any doctor in person, but that - due to the age and poor health of the patients - everything was handled by telephone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this extreme, stressing that "the lack of measures could in no way be the cause of what happened".
La Caritat’s attorney added that “there is no indication in the case that any third party, other than the defendant himself, has committed an error.”
The man, now dubbed the "Angel of Death," confessed to 11 murders yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
In this case, he caused death by administering too much insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing pills.
The director of La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff's access to medicines.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were probably in six of the nine cases the caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to relieve their suffering.
However, it is only the analyses currently underway in the laboratory that should show whether Vila was not lying and was indeed seeking a less cruel death for his first victims or, on the contrary, killed them by administering liquor, as he had already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims and do not rule out that the number of deaths may be higher than he confessed to, and justify their behavior in various versions that Vila submitted to the court knowing that he must change his behavior when it was revealed that he had killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary to shed light on the full extent of the matter.
The European Central Bank threatens
Investors reacted sharply to yesterday's threat from European Central Bank President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The marginal differentials have closed by force and European banks’ shares have fallen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to err - the euro has just risen above its critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market, which, while declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose their fears.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us today to take back the liquidity rate, and tomorrow it will have to appeal for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy back the state debt for inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity rates within the deadline and to keep unlimited access for only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "by at least March" and to meet a three-month bid with unrestricted access by the end of this trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase programme and even announce its intensification.
If the expectations are not met, it will re-create the market reaction of yesterday, and if they continue to blindly withdraw the liquidity rate, God be with us!
It was the same at the convention in May, where they claimed that they had not even considered buying bonds, and the markets collapsed - history could repeat itself tomorrow.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armoured fist announced it on Monday and said on Wednesday that it had already bought many of them, triggering another market crash.
Yesterday's one-year bill auction in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% from the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting the change in market sentiment that took place after the words of Trichet.
in Ireland the figures representing the losses of the Allied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
Estimated amounts amount to about 10,000 million on short-term securities and another potential 15,000, by February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after stress tests failed to reveal the problem in July, the amounts are acceptable under the auxiliary plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday the government will need Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the next EU summit on 14 December, at which a political compromise must be reached to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to Joy.
In Spain, the prime minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to revitalise employment - in the ears of investors it sounds like the Four Seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, or twice as much as other European exchanges.
Unlike in February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing - we are probably benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, we have a key three-year bond bid that will be favoured by the Trichet effect, which hopefully will be in high demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
Asking for a rescue plan would be a self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - there are 40,000 million in cash available at El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would close us to sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Cesar's wife - "not only to be that, but also to appear to be that".
We can do it.
The President of the Eulen Group attacks the actions of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, the owners of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not cease.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the group’s founder, is attacking after calling him “totally insignificant,” El Enebro’s legal action planned for 16 this month and required five of his seven descendants to try to force their majority and seize the Bodegas Vega Sicilia Procurator’s office with the help of the administration.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José fine-tune the legal group for a new chapter in their dispute over the ownership of part of the company.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to settle his dispute about membership in the governing bodies of the El Enebro Group.
Five of his seven descendants, who were appointed leaders during the shareholders' meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register, were deposed from its administrative committee.
The trial of the El Enebro group scheduled for the sixteenth of this month, which was convened by the official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, renewed the rumblings in the womb of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
An appeal against a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquirizov<0xC3><0xA1> considers David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez to be "the desperate means of his five children serving with the help of court tricks and a clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve the January 18th negotiations, which were completely invalid."
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal challenge of this action as "completely insignificant".
The protagonists themselves, who are discreetly silent, have already tried unsuccessfully to call a court meeting in June.
In El Enebro, the group owning, among other activities, Bodegas Vega Sicilia, controls seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires a use right to 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge in the hearing of the question of the trial challenge of the proceedings.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Ever since Red Bull entered Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this extraordinary world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newly incoming team very seriously, and despite the upward trend of recent times, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to reduce the equestrian abilities of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the capabilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend was born in the world of Formula One - the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens placed in the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating the marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for purposes very distant to the automotive sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in power plants, and for high-precision devices.
Its aim is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary mistakes and expenses.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this software instrument allowed the Red Bull team to make “within a few hours, in near-real-time” modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and trials.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to make a maximum of three or four improvements in one period.
Today, the Red Bull team employs 180 young, highly skilled professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull racing vehicles, except for the engine for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are being modified.
Changes can be converted from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical achievement is the amount of $40 million, which is the maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve their competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its race cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists.
Everything that happens here is considered a "great secret".
The list of participants of this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is without a doubt the new champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, behind the immeasurable technological means that the brand of energy drinks has put into its participation in racing circuits, there are other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, and yet no one knows them.
Chief Technology Officer Steve Nevey said that five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to the victory of 50% and the rest was due to the drivers.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the success of 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP to set up 20 stores within two years in collaboration with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with its business partner Pont Reyes, opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday.
The company will be the first of a network of 20 80- to 100-square-metre stores that the multinational plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing department stores such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrer, cited as an example the newly refurbished store at Barcelona’s Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is the third.
Herrera did not want to reveal where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following.
Herrer, who also runs HP’s HR systems, has assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company advises here on the exclusive design of store equipment (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also engaged in the provision of personnel for trades.
Helena Herrer denied that it was a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to “improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in buying, operating, after-sales service and even packaging.”
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot pioneering programme that aims to address potential problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we can solve problems in 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days."
“This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrer.
Sabadell says it will “steal” 1 million customers in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s delegated board member, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a challenging year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it is expected to reduce interest rates, but they will try to compensate by discounting bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to win a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years to survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new strategic plan in 2011 with a three-year duration.
The aim is, in addition to surviving without the need to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by catching a million new private clients - or 700,000, respectively, if those who eventually leave the bank are deducted - because until now the institute has been pampering small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large enterprises rather than small clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs, the challenges of which the bank will show when presenting the results for the period.
Few banking institutions at this time dare to set goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
This year, Sabadell will close its Optima programme, set four years ago, although initially it was for three years, but the market situation required an extension to the next period.
Clients who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 would be "difficult and very important".
Indeed, he believes that the way out of the crisis in Spain "will be a long one".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which is fundamental for the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while they believe that the passive war – which reduces margins – is receding, the price of the premiums for the risk that banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thereby offsetting the reduction of margins.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a coercive factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola said.
Banesto has already issued orders to its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and raise differential prices – see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking is "now to cut commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "greater sizes will be required".
“Next year there will be no stone left on the stone,” he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "very reduced" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions will enter the red list.
And it points out that FROB can supplement fund-raising in the market before a new capital measure.
After reassurance that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis remains a serious problem.
It notes that it is not possible to issue, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be obtained by means of repo rates, which mitigates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of mergers of savings banks
The CEO of CECA denied yesterday that another wave of mergers of savings banks should arise, and again insisted on the speed with which the sector is reorganizing.
When the process of associating the Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that they would not participate in this first phase and would wait for the second round.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already taken place, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca C<0xC3><0xAD>vica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening is the conventions."
"Most of it is fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Heads and Executive Officers of Aragon - note.) Olavarrieta described that the process of concentration is carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very pleased, as it is shown in the payments, which at one time, not now, appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank".
“Moving from 45 savings banks with an average assets of 28,000 million to 17 million to 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to be larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not very happy views on the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we have to be on time before the end of the year".
The CEO of CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said Spain has the strictest financial system in Europe and “probably” in the world, and attributed “lack of knowledge” to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, "we can be calm" about financial institutions and savings banks, as well as the system that has mastered the "very important" process of concentration and which continues "at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that Spain's banking sector has come out very well from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to keep the euro, but laid down conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, ranging from tax cuts for small and medium-sized enterprises, to the regulation of private intermediation agencies or the abolition of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>426 for the unemployed without benefits, to the privatisation of 49% of AENA (Spanish Airports and Air Traffic Management - note.), the administrator of the airports Barajas and El Prae 30%
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, on the other hand, joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to unleash the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, this is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which hints at the idea of adhering to old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, of which Germany would be a part, but also Austria and the Netherlands, for example, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the brand - although it may now seem like scifi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to revise the euro with greater macroeconomic supervision, budgetary rigour, fines for the guilty states, possible deferrals of payments for some of them, and with the extension of possible regulatory costs to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no room for dials.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission spurred deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered correct (plans for fiscal rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The other was shown by the Central European country, when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
Already at that time it was the subject of harsh criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel reappeared with a clear position when she demanded that the European Union's conventions be reformed so as to allow the rescue of a Member State and at the same time that private creditors have a duty to bear part of the costs.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat relaxed form, has been approved, and we should be following the Union's reform process over the coming months, which should allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it tells us all that, although measures must now be taken with which it seems to disagree too much, the old functioning of the euro will cease from that date.
The year 2013 will mark the birth of a new monetary zone, in which violators will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report deferred payments, and the private sector will also have to bear some of the costs.
Germany suggests to us that we must take a strict path of growth with increased savings and investment rates, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
They simply do not want to tolerate another debt-based and building option, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that prevailed during Spain’s boom years.
The offer is clear.
And we would make a mistake if we didn't understand.
This is not just a recovery of the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much tougher.
And the worst thing is that under these conditions, we could happen to be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will be replaced by more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunity they give us by spring 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big businesses and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the road has opened to the idea that things need to be put in order.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it does not seem to want to move it.
And of the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not-so-serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The fins shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show wit not the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be written about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior, and whether UEFA should eventually punish both players.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which their team clearly won) the named players were deliberately wasting time one by one when the foul was supposed to be played to provoke the referee, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will comply with the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid ending up in their group at the head - and will be able, stripped of their cards, to proceed to the next stage.
In the end, the UEFA Disciplinary Commission awarded coach José Mourinho a two-game penalty and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten, but follow each other.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the Real Madrid team (which boasts in its anthem of generosity and honor, and which has already fined its players for similar actions) was a participant in it, and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds another episode to his long history as a comedian and provocateur.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of conduct, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, that is, whether circumvention of the law occurs in these acts; it is indeed an action respecting sports rules, the meaning of which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of damage such actions cause to the sports spirit.
One of the essentials of sports behavior is the physical integrity of the opponents, which in these cases was not violated, that is, there was no violent play.
Another of these features that characterize clean play is to avoid players having an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which also did not happen here.
Paradoxical to the action of the Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as deception or circumvention of the law did not happen, there was no hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behavior should be as obvious as possible in order to receive punishment.
They waited and liked to be punished.
Another question, however, is what advantage will be given to the guilty of their wilful transgression.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that he will not achieve any benefit in the current match, since the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next stage of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in a future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance the team can be eliminated, and besides, players will be relieved of their punishment by this action, and move to the second round of cards, in which one card less than in the first round is enough to exclude.
So how the rounds will continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these negotiations do not go against the sporting spirit, which includes making strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
In the case we are dealing with here, the players did not aim to avoid the punishment (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding or fleeing punishment.
Although the line between wit and circumvention of rules is not clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly wit.
It seems to me that polemics arise for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusions, and because of the way in which instructions were transmitted to provoke them from the leadership.
Damage to sports principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Struggle of bids for Christmas parties in Barcelona
The calendar dictate concentrates this year’s avalanche of reservations on December 16th and 17th.
There is a rapid increase in celebrations paid for by employees themselves, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like Turkish honey or lotteries, with the arrival of December, pre-Christmas parties come again, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but thanks to the crisis resulted in a struggle to win customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros for food, businessmen and associations from this sector agree.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar concentrated this year (when Christmas fell on Friday) applications for a week from December 13th, creating an avalanche of bookings for days at the top (16th and 17th), while there was almost no traffic in the previous week.
As has happened since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that canceled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay the expense of parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of carrying capacity, says Gaieta Farras, president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restaurac<0xC3><0xB3> de Barcelona.
The representative of the patronage of restaurants at the moment does not dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will change their minds before they make a reservation."
“They want to go out, but when it comes to the issue of prices, they are careful,” he adds.
Shops will do well for those who “offer quality and good service at a favorable price,” he says and recalls that thanks to the crisis, customers tend to go a step down and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
Surveys at various facilities show that the biggest increase in booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
The Soteras Group reports a real booking boom for this Friday, with the most requests being for spending up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30, adapted to the menus offered, with total prices ranging from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.
In another major company, Andilana, which has 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought the peculiarity of this year’s calendar to more early bookings since the beginning of November.
“We have made it possible and impossible to maintain last year’s prices, and our menus, from which everyone should choose, range from 19.95 to 30 euros.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after seeing a profit increase from the second half of the year and have a fairly solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources point out that December 18 will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations will be held among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency for guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which again invite their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "contract to the maximum".
This impression, even during the Christmas celebrations, did not give way, no matter who pays, he points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program sparks great unrest in the United States
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
WikiLeaks documents confirm links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by Wikileaks confirms the extreme unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program is causing in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of communications and ideas of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, instead of increasing, is "in retreat", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other".
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to make it difficult to destroy them in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for Washington's vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador to Pakistan Anne W. Patterson in a report before the visit of then-national security adviser James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to Taliban-controlled territory, the alleged dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials."
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the program of guided missiles is no longer observed only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a spreading and presenting reason to be alert.
“Pakistan had to hire staff with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; as education and culture declines, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear or missile-guided programs,” Russian State Department expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The biggest news of the documentation published by Julian Assange's server is the increasingly reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the topics of proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
A dispatch issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," says: "Transparency often does not exist; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence officer for South Asia, said: “Despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also asks Washington to make it very clear during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that “the Pakistani army must end its silent support for terrorist groups.”
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama is appointing a senior counter-terrorism official to avoid further leaks.
Interpol is issuing a "red call" to track down and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol yesterday announced an "extraordinary call", a so-called red notice, to "locate and track the movement" of Assange.
However, this is not a classic arrest warrant.
In addition, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20th.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for Wikileaks, said: “The police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was November 20, when a corps of international police based in Lyon, France, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from Swedish authorities.
In this situation, the 188 countries of Interpol have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary detention and extradite him".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of the person concerned by the red notice, many Member States, as the organisation explained, consider the so-called red notices to be enabling the arrest to be carried out - this must be ensured by the national police force - especially when the states have a bilateral agreement on the extradition of the detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange would probably be referred to.
The move offended Assenge's lawyers, who published a letter yesterday claiming that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder had shown willingness to answer questions from Swedish authorities via videoconferencing.
Assenge has requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare with the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the head of Stalin's security.
"This is a hunt, not a legal persecution," the letter said.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother is defending his son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he does not remain silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to the editor-in-chief of Time magazine – in this interview, he demanded the resignation of US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the United Nations in violation of international conventions that the United States has signed, she should step down,” he said.
His view was rejected by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request as "ridiculous and absurd".
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who runs the website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Rusell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views voiced by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the House of Commons from January, asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations “so that anyone who contributes financially or otherwise provides assistance can be targeted and prosecuted.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went even further, saying that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to revoke.
"Obama should write him a reward or use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for leaking information, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild," he said.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s looking in ERC for peace of mind "by blinking" at a supporter of the Coroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found a recipe for fighting the ERC’s already-severalth internal revolt, which has failed due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the vote.
The President of the Party is aware that his gesture of resignation seems insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Caroda-Rovira, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weak as its leader himself, and that he can absolutely not make him as worried as he had with other faded currents.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to gain new criticism through a eclipse that will help him to face the municipal elections.
First, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to make a secret statement about his stay in office.
Using ballots, not raising a hand.
If they want to hand over a criminal vote to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid splitting and subjugating his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half of the votes and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage, that he would also not have a good result "in Bulgarian".
The supporters of Caroda demand more from the president than to make his office available - which they consider a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the largest organ at congresses.
But given that they do not have enough majority to enforce their resignations, they will try to executively resemble the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which the leadership will vote on to the National Council on the 18th day of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for promising to move the congress as early as the fall of 2011.
The leader of the ERC said that “pluralism” damages stability, and that its goal is for the organization to be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, there seems to be a characteristic article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercos's ideologue, this innovation adviser took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed "in exchange for several goals".
And he named five of them, of which two stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which also means including new faces who are from a sector favored by Caroda.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely end the meeting as a mechanism of functioning.
And so he fights for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates chosen by vote.
Termination of the model of the meeting system, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercos' team, which has already fought in this direction at the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 convulsive assembly decided that the meeting must be considered at a special congress on statute reforms.
The matter is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of the matter.
Now, without pending critical sectors, it might be a good time to rethink this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to the daily MILENIO, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are the case of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the find of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a mercy wound to the head, and had his hands and feet tied with rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk that was stored in the luggage compartment of a vehicle over Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, co-workers discovered a body bearing signs of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in a section of Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a message allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later, in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a fifty-year-old man was murdered by eight gunshots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7, two victims, aged 30, were killed by a bullet in the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the Ecatepec district.
In Chalco, on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo, the corpse of a man shot in the forehead was found, and a 25-caliber casing was found under the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in a sewage channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue teams have conducted a thorough search for other parts, but have not found them.
Residents of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n reported the body found with their hands tied back and their head wrapped in the place of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who had been wrapped in bed linen and left in the luggage compartment of a vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza was reported, and the victims were also found to be in danger of death.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the Los Reyes district of La Paz.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in bed linen in the Zoquiapan settlement in Ixtapaluca district, and the next morning, a murdered man was found in Huixquilucan wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, which was provisionally identified as Mario R<0xC3><0xAD>os, according to a report left by the killers at his body.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman was found in the San Francisco village of Acuautla with no sign of life, with two wounds to the back of her neck.
On the skin of the woman was discovered the tattoo of the sacred figure Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - note. transl.) and necklaces with her image.
At the end of the month, the body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a message signed by a criminal group was found in a car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men who had their heads wrapped in tape were found, and a report was found with them, in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, a report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which stated: “This will happen to those who do not adapt.”
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found bearing marks of torture and with their limbs tied, inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center in the San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n colony.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first was beheaded and found in the colony of Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was wrapped in black plastic bags, strapped with tape and had a message left behind; while the second was tortured and found in plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Agents also found a note along with him.
China pursues its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
A representative of the country at the UN conference on climate change COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce carbon footprint, and specified that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will keep its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public address to the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he noted that China will not change its goals and will continue to work together with the international community on this issue.
China’s climate change strategy is divided into four pillars: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, they have already made progress, including last year’s adoption of a new Energy Act, which includes proposed targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, he explained.
He also stressed that in China, federal authorities worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
Further, he said, various multi-year plans are in progress or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and other governments.
For example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been in place for the past five years, has received investment from the United Nations, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, as well as a project to replace fluorescent lamps with energy-saving bulbs and a project to mitigate and adapt.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert advisor on climate change, assured that China’s efforts were greater than is generally thought.
For example, greenhouse gas emissions per capita account for 6 tons in China, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use - for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020.
Legislated Exclusion of Espinos: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional, Czech: National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to claim his right with the National Order Commission.
The national chairman of the PAN party, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been enacted and that the former chairman of that party was entitled to address the National Order Commission and claim his right.
In an interview taken before the objection was raised by the governor of the state, Gabin Cué Monteagudo, he said that the expulsion of Espin is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Ordinance Commission in Sonora."
“Mr. Espino has the right to address his case through a complaint to the Ordinary Commission of the National Council so that it is a decision made by the competent authority,” he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012 and that she had never been at the negotiating table for the Alliance's presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez expressed his belief that the PAN will be strengthened from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
“This [2012 alliance] is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not so far, it was the intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose,” he said.
The President of the PAN said that 71 years of dialogue were behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competition, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said the committee could no doubt elect the best president or chairperson the PAN deserves for the next three years, so he would hand over the relay to "whom the committee will designate".
"So I am absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will proudly hand over the office of party chairman to any of the five."
He predicted that the party's rise in the last July elections would be reflected in future elections, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances of Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be observed throughout the country, as "many expectations and aspirations are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to these expectations".
When we asked him about criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n by the PRI party (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech: Revolutionary Institutional Party) because of his speeches within the four years he reigns, César Nava urged PRI members to reflect on the six-year terms of former presidents Carlisle and Ernesto Zeno.
“If PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Clader<0xC3><0xB3>n, then let them start defending them, let them get out of their shell,” he said.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself as he did during a speech in the National Auditorium, because there is no gag or censorship in this country.
Obama tweets law to support undocumented students
“If you think the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted on social media.
President Barack Obama has joined a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which is supposed to legalize undocumented students.
“If you think the Dream Act is the right thing to do, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to an Internet link to a more comprehensive document asking the public to contact the senators immediately as the vote on the law is approaching.
“As the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard,” he said.
The report came after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any bill unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding was approved.
Such blocking, which was announced by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the Dream Act vote and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believed that once the fiscal issue was resolved, it would be possible to draw up a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach an agreement on this issue and then we will be able to plan the order of the other issues," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a “closed-debate vote” on the Dream Act, so a proposal to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
Senatorial approval of the Dream Act would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have resided in the country for the past five years, and have been admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, so they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are carrying out intensive agitation to ensure the approval of the bill.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the law.
Therefore, Dream Act proponents need to win a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators most heavily negotiated by supporters are Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Colins, as well as the outgoing Florida Senator George Lemieux, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they have said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet spoken out.
Although the House of Representatives is leaning toward a different version, most analysts say the Dream Act will face the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
with literature put a finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is similar to the Czech "to hit a nail on the head - note.
The second round of the Pleasure of Language series was a promenade where the participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand Sex in the language, but... Finger to the wound? What is expected of me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was invited to start the second round of Pleasure of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used on this occasion as a subtitle (at another fair).
The finger in the wound "brings us into the narrow", said the Argentinian writer kindly to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who gathered at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to listen to this debate at the round table, moderated by Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuela, Sergio Garz<0xC3><0xAD>r and Rag<0xC3><0xAD>r.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Schultz then described as a great story, in which Luisa appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who, in search of knowledge, goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get an answer, although traces of the same story do.
From the infectologist leaves convinced: "patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound."
Finally, after frustration with the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound is really open and therefore symbolic scar."
The protagonist sighed lightly and came to the conclusion that "she only managed to learn so much about the wound that it is really open and that it does not exist", but gained the conviction that the pleasures and pitfalls in the language must go hand in hand.
Writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also gave a delightful account, which he called the Glory of Invention, in which the finger is not named in the wound, but at one point it appears.
with elements of magical realism narrates of the famous witch who played the clouds, brought back the captains who had gone far, or corrected the decency that a virgin had lost, this narration which then turned to speak America, a great novel in which from the beginning was not lacking his own chroniclers, and which was narrated by
"Cervantes, who invented us all, ridiculed the fake testimonies that were presented in the stories as real, but in another way he never managed to tell the story of America with such imaginativeness that it lacked even shame."
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater imagination" and precisely where reality and lies merge, where one no longer knows what from the story belongs to one group and what from the other, the fictional literature reaches its peak.
It is called the Cervantes tradition.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monter emphasized and praised the diversity of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with its word Finger in the Wound made possible.
The Cuban-Portorian writer pointed her finger to the great blow of social violence that is passing through her country – and shared by Latin America – and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
“I think good literature, good poetry, and good songs conclude a silent compromise that is obviously not intended,” she said, after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is being created between the author and the readers – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of a writer bound by a writer".
He said that in a world that lives in haste, also in intellectual habits and in the control of consciousness, which is overflowing with dogmatism, it is forgotten that "behind every hint there is a small no and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
In order to be masters of our thoughts and our reality, we must color: and coloring means many times to put a finger in the wound and to annoy those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black and white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to annoy the authorities who prefer this black and white for the black and white world.
Romano is on his way to his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he has already managed to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series.
In the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the finals, two different styles, characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano counts three defeats in the final, during his career he experienced good and bad, but he was able to achieve on three occasions on the decisive series, but until now he left with an unfinished, and this is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentinian had to settle for a silver medal, remained one step behind the winner and played curiously with the same team in the next final.
The Santista strategist reached his first final in the 2002 Apertura tournament when he was in the hands of Morelia, with whom he lost 4–2 to Toluca in total; then, in the 2003 Clausura tournament, he again advanced to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3–1, which was against Rayados.
Already with the club Santos Laguna in the tournament Torneo Bicentenario in 2010, again he got two draws from the "Devils" from Toluca, Ruben again suffered a defeat, although his team played against "Uzen<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - note.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, so he can celebrate the title for the first time, although he says that it is the most important institution for him.
“I want to come out as a winner, I don’t want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion that I’m committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important,” the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in his vivid memory he has a previous final, in which, as he confirms, he has learned a lot, "we have learned the lesson that until the referee finishes, we can't celebrate, we have to be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were ready to run out to celebrate, and I think that's what we learned until we finish the match, we can't celebrate."
He is not worried that this series could decide in criminal shootings, we believe in what we have lost in our hands, but he believes in our players: "You never try to come to a series of criminal kicks, you try to end up in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared for it, in the last tournament we were ready, but unfortunately fate has prepared for us a bad move, perhaps because of the
Romano has a chance in his hands to stop being the second and taste the glory brought by the titles for the first time.
U.S. to change visa rules
People will have to contact the Visa Application Services before interviewing the Consular Department; costs will be lower and waiting times will be shortened.
The visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change as of January 10, 2011.
with the new procedure, most applicants will have to contact the Visa Application Services Centres (abbreviated from English ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC staff will remove the applicant’s biometric information and it will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging the meeting, the second for processing the application and others for delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant shall pay only a single fee covering all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 for tourist visas, $150 for visa applications (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for visas for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visas will not have to interview a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and fingerprints will be taken from them.
As biometric information will be taken away in the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview meeting at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at the consulates in Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an additional $26 service fee.

NASA announces discovery of extraterrestrial life
The U.S. space agency has convened a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that studies the origin, evolution, spread and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA’s headquarters in Washington, D.C.
When she invited reporters, NASA assured that it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", which aroused speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and which could present the possibility that they will one day become intelligent creatures like humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another, second life form, different from the one we know".
The space agency will announce the real extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n spawn opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Law on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period has not even begun, when the opposition bloc was created in the Congress, led by the deputies of the parties of the PRD (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3>n Democr<0xC3><0xA1>tica, Czech: "Partido del Trabajo", Czech: "Partido de la Trabajo" (Partido del Trabajo, Czech: "Partido de la Trabajo"), Convergencia (Partido de la Revoluci<0xC3><0xB3> Democ.
Before the opening session of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of PRD and Patron Montalvo were "screaming" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it excludes them.
With this reform, they repeated, “Bapartism” begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilarov<0xC3><0xA1>, coordinator of the PRD party, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito from the PAN (Partido Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n, Czech "National Action Party" - note.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms constitute an institutional political marginality on the initiative of the PRI parties (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech: "Revolutionary Institutional Party") and the PAN.
He specified that in the coming days they will talk with representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not, they will again be subjected to these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When I came here [the opposition coalition], I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have a willingness to consider the opinions of others.”
Convergencia's Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez said they agree with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n and will therefore form a pluralistic group.
It is impossible to allow, he continued, for Congress, after it was monopolistic, to be now "duopoly".
The aspiration of law reform is not to have an infinite bipartism in Congress.
The group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, according to Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that currently Congress has become the "prey" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by only one side, now it's divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the MP's personality be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
“So that the five MPs, who are likely to be nine, but who see us in five right now, do not stay out because of the arched agreements, each in a different faction, we have united to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that they have formed and agreed to, we stand out, and we do not agree with this reform.”
Another 200,000 pesos are being issued for the "supplier"
Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Hall will pay another cheque to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the town hall to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in this second half of the year to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material will rise to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued at the amount of 200.144.56 pesos and its subject was listed as "compensation of outstanding payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many checks will still be sent in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe her, as well as the other suppliers, is paid to her," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and the last on November 16.
Although this businesswoman has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as indicated by the law in the case of companies inspected by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that she did not use the services of the City Hall contractor again.
Previously, after July 25, Noroeste published a review of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that between March 2008 and July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, the city of Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million pesos through 42 cheques.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites are in dire need of maintenance
Tourist managers are complaining about the accident of a foreign tourist due to the poor condition of S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada's chat in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
Following the fall of a foreign tourist into a depression at S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboady’s talk show, the Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n tourism sector is asking the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition and not to show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Traders Association, recalled that they have repeatedly asked for the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the mess, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a business for a day, and they have no idea of the sales they’re escaping, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said the tourist’s fall had caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
“The workshop will have to take responsibility and prevent such a thing from happening again, it will have to deal with preventive maintenance, not just to repair existing defects,” he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, because even as residents we deserve a clean dwelling, the town hall should change its strategy for the maintenance of the city.
There are other places that look neglected and miserable, he noted, such as the Mazatlan Emblem and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it is not only about promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, i.e. a city rich in cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There has not been the necessary attention here, and these facts highlight something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is lacking.
He talked about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive, because it has tourist potential.
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, a subsecretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n is urgent, as they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n offers many historical and cultural goals and space, but it will need to be put in order first to make these places more attractive and to put them on the list we have to promote this destination.”
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, would like MPs to take great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges the state faces.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and no agreements between the parties and the State Executive requires the business sector in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n, as Sinaloa is writhing in convulsions and facing great problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term has begun, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergence and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from new members of Congress is to be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and various areas that require responsible legislative work, and not to repeat the same party and paternalistic patronage.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress should take on a great responsibility and set an example on their way to a better Sinaloa in the various challenges they face.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to advance their own interests and become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he talked about the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that would move the ruling party forward in order.
“We want them to do decent work and be committed to society and the sectors, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election.”
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all forces in an effort to achieve economic growth of the country, because the current economic situation is very complicated.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth, to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which in some way will support the creation of jobs.”
As for tourism, he demanded that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
“I have learned that this is the ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that this is an important economic activity, bringing in currencies and investments, which, moreover, directly competes with agriculture.”
In addition to spending money on start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and help with an alcohol law that has not been resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
We are looking for three kings
Dolls, cars and bicycles, along with other toys, are on the wish list of children in the family Coronade Valenzuela.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their dreams on the upcoming feast of the Three Kings, as their household consists of exactly 12 people and one ram.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s, José Alfredo, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest home in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poverty, as the father does not have a permanent job.
“Sometimes we have a hard time because my husband is not lucky, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with ‘plebeians’ on the street to sell on the street,” said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, a mother of children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for the 10-year-old José Alfred, he would have wanted a "monster" car for a while, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesus, she would have wanted Cayetana to wear a one-year-sized outfit.
"He said to me (José Alfredo) 'I wish I had this monster car,' but I said 'we'll see, son,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled.
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal clothes and shoes.
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, has a size of 12, ten-year-old Isa<0xC3><0xAD>as has a size of 10, while eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing sneakers, so he could use a pair of five and a half or six.
To help fulfill the dreams of children from the Coronade Valenzuela family, you can take part in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of the Noroeste daily bring a gift or cash.
14 Alleged Drug Traffickers Arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estria, on Wednesday, as part of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
Tours were held in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, mostly in places used to make drugs.
“Approximately 750 cans of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment used for production were confiscated,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a police spokesman in Quebec.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were the alleged leaders of the network, two of whom were Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons had to appear at the Sherbrooke Palace of Justice after their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian hemp, holding it for the purpose of trading it, conspiracy and theft, among other things.
These inspections were carried out after a long investigation that took almost a year.
“It was information we received from the public that allowed us to proceed with these arrests,” Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 police officers of the regional investigation department of the city of Estria, the Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphisagog Police Department.
Illegal migration will continue without problems.
The Conservative bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of boats loaded with illegal immigrants, will obviously be overturned, while all three opposition parties said on Wednesday they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
“I stand directly on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the week-long du caucus.
Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, a law that would allow the detention for up to one year of any person from a ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The head of the Québec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading for the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
NPD critic on immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not to be strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“Neo-Democrats agree to take action against smugglers of illegal immigrants, and that is what we consider to be the backbone of another bill, the C-35,” Chow said.
“We do not support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and puts children in prison for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has blamed the opposition parties.
“Canadians are telling lawmakers in large numbers that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that are taking Canada at its fingertips and treating it like some kind of pariah.”
They expect Canada to take strict measures, Minister Kenney said.
The government did not declare a vote of confidence in her bill, which could lead the country to elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that any MP who opposes it would be held accountable for his position before his constituents.
Unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent anti-corruption and anti-collision unit, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public inquiry committee on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, is working to ensure that this idea does not fall into oblivion: Québec intends to consult with the Department of Investigation in New York on this issue as early as January next year.
Metropole has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Tuesday’s announcement surprised many of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed, even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
More than that, public safety critic PQ's Stéphane Bergeron did not need to describe the announcement as "a rabbit pulled out of a hat" and "an amateur solution swollen on its knees".
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He will be satisfied with the confirmation: you will see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness interview in a public hearing.
“Moreover, Mr. Charest insists he doesn’t want to set up this commission of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he’s hiding something,” he said.
“The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative committee is to dismiss Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of High Public Officials.
In order to get out of this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec give special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusiveness and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
He also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioner, allowing him to force people to testify.
The establishment of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the files of the Charest government.
Quebec would also like Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it is better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would come from the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law on this type of investigation was not explicit.
The Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this file.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Penal Code had not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
Rivers under strict supervision.
Several watercourses have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
Two houses were evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The road is tilted.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, several regions were hit by heavy rains, i.e. raining from 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 additional millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
Sections in the north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were most affected.
It could drop up to 100 millimeters in total.
If we add up these precipitations with the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some watercourses.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Rescue Service issued a flood warning for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentides forest, and in Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, became the subject of flood alert and continuous control.
In the area of de Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re, heavy rainfall caused the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was torn down as a result of heavy rains.
Two homes had to be evacuated.
In Outaouais, the outflow of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service is on standby and oversees the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Center for Flood Prediction issued a flood warning Wednesday for several rivers, notably the Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont was partially discredited.
Quebec radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (RRTV) over controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians, as well as rude language during the broadcast.
The Radio and Television Council considers that Mr Dupont and his group at CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance and inappropriate negative portrayals of Haitians of gross expression that did not correspond to the broadcasts broadcast during the day".
The Council also concluded that discussions on suicide, including the transmission of the names of the two persons who took their own lives, did not violate the rules on radio broadcasting.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Common Front of Social Assistance Beneficiaries.
The group complained that the amounts shown in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive information.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont believed that suicide was a gesture of desperation.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report transmitted was such that suicide could not be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"Most of the Commission believe that the contentious episodes of the 'Dupont's Midnight Reports' have come across a delicate topic in an impartial and appropriate manner."
There was no reproach against him.
The latest dispute concerned a statement that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Thus, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort engaged in a media shootout that sparked many reactions.
The moderator of the CHOI stated that he did not send any donation to help the Haitians, because we cannot be sure that the needy will actually receive the money.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates an unreasonably negative image of Haitians.
"I've already rescinded my three-day delay to the thing."
"My file has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio broadcaster cooperated "beyond its duties".
For a station that will have to notify these decisions, among other things, once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King du kung-fuv<0xC3><0xA0> of Montreal.
The Montréal native, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely peculiar range.
An athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), in kickboxing and Thai boxing, enters tatami and rings around the world in search of new challenges.
“I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Zemmal, who has been living in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.”
“In my case, I look for matches a little bit everywhere, because for those who don’t like playing on the ground that appears in combat sports, competitions in North America are rare.”
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and assistant to UPS, just delivered bad news to his rivals when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from October 23 to 30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing,” he said.
"I'm currently preparing for China for the San Shou World Cup."
"They invited the rivals who finished first four in the last World Cup in each category."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament in the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished in the third," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have made some progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be the first this year or next year!"
"san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot strikes, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches take place traditionally on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, derived from this form of combat, is an American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal is to retain only one result in his career, he boldly confirms his participation in the "King of Sanda" Super Bowl in kung fu.
“This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China,” explains a sympathetic guy.
"It's kind of the equivalent of Stade Lumpinee (Thailand's largest stadium)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he was analysing."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete to crown a single champion, the kung fu king."
450 million contracted without public tenders
Hydro-Québec agreed to $450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium made up of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most significant contract, a $295 million contract to manage the entire project without a public tender.
This consortium, on behalf of <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was authorized in 2004 in parallel with Hydro-Québec’s selection to entrust to the private sector its responsibility for the management of this major $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any announcement of a public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of businesses poses a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and triggering price increases.
"It's a new way to make a collage and eliminate competition."
“This means that people no longer make side agreements secretly, they are now making them openly,” PQ MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
A little earlier, in the morning, M. Simard put this question to the National Assembly, because he says it is difficult to bear how the public interest can be sold like this.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, this afternoon objected, vehemently denying that it would be a collusive contract.
"I have my own way," she said, claiming that PQ was "dishonest" and "lacked accuracy."
She said "that would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which will allow two or more companies to group their mutual expertise so that they can respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex given the scope of the work.
Construction is underway and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of the consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the consortium’s formula for consulting in engineering is under investigation in the government.
If we fly over the business register of Québec companies, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
Regarding the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular the fact that "the territory of la Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been reacting to it since the 1970s".
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, from the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that forces us to take the lead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you go to a competition and there are few bidders, your bids may be higher."
"You have two choices: that is, that you pick up the people who appear in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, 'Let's make a deal at a satisfactory and good price.'"
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people," Mr Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts worth more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 contracts for consulting in the field of engineering, concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, especially with laboratories conducting soil samples analysis.
SNC-Lavalin earned 22 contracts, of which Génivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a stake in Energie gérance.
All contracts have been concluded.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known of the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau leaked a report that PQ was also linked to the companies that "financed" it, before making it clear that it was more about its executives.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - Green Label Doesn't Boost Confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Québec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in the "unbiased" brands and environmental certification, to be guided accordingly in the selection of products.
The worst thing is that even if we bathe in a media universe that urges us and encourages more socially responsible consumption, this media universe laments a lack of credible information, a failure to perform duties that it even qualifies as a brake on its commitment, according to Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre Responsible Consumption, whose first article came out yesterday.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still don’t trust them much.
Two-thirds of us actually say we don’t trust companies’ environmental promises, simply because green advertising by companies is finding out a measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University’s Responsible Consumption Observatory.
Other findings: Half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that are labelled as environmentally responsible.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is accepted as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
However, information on responsible consumption seems to be paramount in stimulating this consumption page, which is currently revived by almost a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre identified, after the higher price of these products.
Indeed, a third of Quebecers are distrustful of the product or "green" services we seek to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and especially to change the brand of one or more products, thereby responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping with merchants from their neighbourhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre said.
More "green" and responsible - the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumer Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, striving to minimize the environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental conscience apparently remained somewhere outside their car, Barom<0xC3><0xA8>tre reports: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or recommending the use of a car to drive at least two people, in the interests of nature conservation.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavior survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested to participate financially in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, agrees to participate, but only up to the amount of the loan.
Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, a developer company that sought a $7 million donation from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and that proved its mission as a film lover, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the government of Quebec is proposing a lower-than-expected loan that could lay the groundwork for a viable solution on favorable terms and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and the 12.8 million request were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but the applications have already been revised to cut.
The proposal and the action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre, President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who manages the eXcentris cinema project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le et Angus has until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the state gift hypothesis must indeed be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, considering that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
But several participants in the discussion, on the contrary, demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his cinemas during ten years of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which could be the reason for the change by the financial council of the state.
The lack of independent film halls is glaring in Montréal, and eXcentris was able to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, with Christian Yaccarini at its head, is running a campaign to mobilize funds into the private sector, in the belief that it will spend $700,000 to push through the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parall<0xC3><0xA8>le, has continued to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and screen the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remind Le Devoir and so he is ignored, he and his group are thinking about the proposals for reduction that are made to him.
Raised curtain on Canada as a whole...
New U.S. diplomatic sources familiar with WikiLeaks reveal what the United States regards as a complex of Canadian inferiority to Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority to the latter’s nominees against Canada.
American diplomats are therefore surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when it comes to voting, and believe that President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government adopt its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released to the public yesterday, provide more sensitive details to get under each other’s skin.
The announcement, dated September 22, 2008, in the middle of the election campaign, details the point at which the United States is not part of the bets discussed by political leaders.
To the great amazement of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins provides several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian inferiority complex, almost stagnant, makes possible political leaders to talk about domestic bets, rather than realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
“The United States,” he concluded, “is a proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The Ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less because both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, a party, or even better, a party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when they go to the polls.”
Another expression of this sense of importance can be found in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a charge d'affaires in Ottawa <0xC3><0xA0> Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“Your path will help ensure that the government remains in a confidence vote in early February, regarding the federal budget, to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a recovery plan of $30 to $40 billion,” Breese wrote.
No mention of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition, and that the opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another report from January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington's attention to the increasingly negative image that the United States is throwing at the dramatic series broadcast on the CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O broadcasts in which not-so-smart references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also kidnappings for the purpose of violent CIA interrogations can be observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to take in some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says, "he handed over some paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, to the State Secretary."
"Mystery accepted by revising the file."
Finally, let’s note that the people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be “destroyed.”
It was announced and Mike Huckabee in the United States heard about it.
The World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
In Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, lighting of shops and industrial premises in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect (GES) limit, which corresponds to almost one-third of the additional limit that needs to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to push forward in Canc<0xC3><0xBA>n to compensate for the lack of hard-to-realize commitments to reduce on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if we replace incandescent bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, with fluo-compact bulbs or, even better, with bulbs with electroluminescence diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a significant amount of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GES emissions on the planet generated by lighting would be cut off.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the world’s car fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, joined voluntary plans to reduce global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will be necessary to deduct 5 Gt from this balance in order to achieve a stabilization of climate warming to 2 degrees Celsius by 2020 in order to exclude that it will not get out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat, and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluo-compact bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new DEL bulbs, we will reduce this consumption twice more.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, such as those introduced this week to the production of Philips - this company allegedly participated in the UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a glowing bulb, giving us an idea of a possible savings with a replacement plan that would be applied in 100 countries.
All of these new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluocompact bulbs because they contain mercury and need to be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless producers set up collection centres.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluocompact bulb, but rather a thermal coal-fired power plant, which releases a lot of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centers release 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the gains that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save a billion dollars a year to buy electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of a 3.5-billion-dollar thermal power plant.
The Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election after the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent election commission to complete its work and to immediately announce the preliminary results," a spokesman for the UN president said.
“It asks all parties and institutions in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission allowed the ultimate date - Wednesday midnight - to lapse, without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's cruelty.
About 40 minutes before the deadline, the CEI president confirmed on television that the commission was “going to work” to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara, increased around the world.
But Camp Gbagbo relies on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of the "fraudulent" vote in the north, which has been administered by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast presidential election campaign, confirmed that the voter intimidation maneuvers practiced by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged supporters of President Ivory Coast from going to vote.
The election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any connection to the former insurgents, denounced the delay in declaring the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he has suffered a loss, and that filing a complaint to the Constitutional Council after preventing the election commission from broadcasting the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was seen as the coronation of the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two halves for years.
The United Nations warned on Wednesday the Ivory Coast political faction that it could be held accountable for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, on 31 October, as a winner with 38% of the vote against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who won the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The unemployment rate in France in terms of the word, according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas areas), as shown by provisional data with correction of seasonal deviations (CVS), published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed remained stable at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks, to work, and whether they are looking for a job or not.
The current situation of young people in the labour market has further escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas areas.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed.
In terms of seniors, they recorded a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as in a year), i.e. 482,000 people from 50 years up and 6.6% including overseas areas.
Only the population aged 25-49 benefited from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after controversy over its method of calculation.
Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and put in custody
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS Governing Board of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public contracts allegedly acquired illegally.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of company assets, misuse of public funds and public property, concealment, providing bribes, accepting bribes for the purpose of influencing the office and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is militant and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, and not some delusions."
“It’s easy to pursue him for many criminal reasons, but it’s another thing to prove them,” his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before questioning her client.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he had sent the judge a brief statement before his hearing to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client never did anything other than to ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of any such thing, said Mr Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former General Manager of the Aubagne agglomeration services, was charged on Wednesday with misuse of public funds and plots, and left at large, under the judicial supervision of a ban, the protagonist of the whole matter.
"My client was able to give an explanation of all the facts that are being reproached him."
"The investigating judge is looking into this and leaving him at liberty," his lawyer, Mr Yann Arnoux, said in a statement.
Four other people were charged and released on Tuesday night, with two of them under judicial review, said Deputy Attorney General Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes to influence the office and for passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "theft and misuse of company assets", the other for "complot in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini's business associate, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "covering up the misuse of company assets".
Among the persons confronted by Mr Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently indicted in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement relating to Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies have helped launder money from a large-scale gangster business.
The investigation is being conducted as part of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009, following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in public procurement, in particular on waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects garbage from Aubagne, as well as from some cities of the Marseille Metropolitan Municipality (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée Palace exaggerates Syria mediation
In more than a decade, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for “spying,” unified views in France, put diplomacy on combat alert, and stressed relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is closely watched by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the drawbacks of the crisis.
They describe how the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how leading French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of a young French woman was no compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France and wanted by the US Justice Department for smuggling material in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they bring to the fore the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he did nothing for it.
A diplomatic telegram written in Paris on August 12, 2009 reads: "Iran:French comments on how to deal with hostages".
<0xC3><0x89>lysée’s Strategic Affairs Adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by Quai d’Orsay’s North Africa Middle East Director, Patrice Paoli, is speaking with Allegrone, a U.S. diplomat.
They explain the French method.
They encourage Americans to do just as much to bring back their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “continue to utter loudly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate liberation.”
The Iranian regime, sensitive to its image, needs to be put into trouble.
"Do it more the more they ask you to stop."
Because attempts to negotiate through discrete channels “silently solves nothing”, the Iranians are “masters of avoiding maneuvers”.
Mr Richier recalls that the arrest of foreigners is “an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of “political blackmail.”
She announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day the French embassy gives her sanctuary) “will require a large sum of money to be paid to the Iranians” (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>230,000 security deposit).
And they'll announce that the Elysée Palace is anticipating hostage cases, a phenomenon that's "going to escalate".
In the future, the Iranians could arrest another 1,800 Frenchmen living in Iran.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
The information is spreading: Iranian Majid Kakavand, who the United States claims to have been deported for illegal trade in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, like many observers, is asking about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is persecuting illegal Iranian networks to procure nuclear material, the expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Did France agree to the deal?
The liberation of Iran for the liberation of a young Frenchwoman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier assures that this is not the case.
The <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace, he said, was not only "surprised by the judge's decision", but was looking for a way to oppose it.
"There were talks between the presidential office and the justice minister" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the court's decision," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance by the French intelligence service.
The <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace adviser dials a phone number, hangs a phone call, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings administered by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss’ imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating through communications and organized “escapes” to the media to convince them that Syrian President Bachar al-Assad is playing a “significant” and “influencing” role as a “mediator.”
The Americans observe this activity not without irony and note that manipulation bears fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
The telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blitz" of French officials.
What is the basis for such a measure of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their statements, full of praising French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then examines the reasons that forced the Elysée Palace to pay for this fiction.
“Intense communication is aimed at validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he said.
The policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labelled as premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can earn when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them."
“It should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among the Iranians.”
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace.
In the communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the liberation of our countrywoman".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called "Pecival" that will ban adolescents from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, government officials said.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to the games after midnight for people under the age of 16, officials from the culture ministry and the family ministry said.
“Many children play these games all night long and then have trouble learning at school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day.”
“We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,” Jo Rin, a senior official at the ministry in charge of the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government also expects to ask companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request it.
It will also make free programs available to people who ask for it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries, and the daily press regularly brings various facts associated with the intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full riots over suspected corruption are set by FIFA’s executive committee on Thursday in the host country of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup, a choice of sovereignly politically motivated, where the fight for influence and lobbying risk overtaking the technical criteria.
The matter is certain, the Royal FIFA competition in 2018will be held in Europe, the traditional turf of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue its deployment to the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government officials of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives an opportunity to form an idea of the scale of the entire economic and political world.
Negotiations behind the scenes are at risk of continuing until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy by candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons won’t weigh too much for the 22 members of the executive committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, at the beginning of the revelations leading to the suspension of two members of the CE /European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu), may have thus destroyed the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which has so far hosted the World Cup only once a year.
The BBC rolled the crown on Monday when it broadcast a document that "stuck on a pin" three influential members of the CE (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA unhappy and put the English leader in trouble with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes to replicate the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who won the London 2012 Olympic Games in 2005.
Will this intense activity suffice to give England a new shine to its name at CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the couple Spain-Portugal lacks the trophy of already ready-made stadiums, his endorsement (the 1982 World Championship in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the grim economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliatory measures against the English and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite the gaps in its documentation (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Poutin decided not to move the championship to Zurich and publicly declared "small competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal allusions barely twisted to the accusations of the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Mr. Poutin said.
For 2022, they seem to be the logical favorite of the United States with its considerable experience from 1994.
The world’s highest performing economy, home to FIFA’s main sponsors, seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidatures seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "exam" in 2002.
Another threat: the awarding of the 2026 World Cup to China, which fifa fervently wishes, has rendered Asia’s chances for 2022 invalid.
With Qatar pulling a big ace out of its sleeve in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new landscapes, but the two countries pose more risks than certainty.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could be charged for the feeless TV (due to the time shift) paid by European countries, forming the driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was really hesitant.
Mitterrand aroused the impression that he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing et Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace mandate calls someone else.
The current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the obvious is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
It is necessary to act as if the doubts persisted.
In both senses.
In 2006, without being convinced, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims that a third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, with a serious expression, Nicolas Sarkozy assured that he would "decide sometime in the autumn of 2011".
As the UMP reminds members of parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysee Palace, the prospect of “two mandates” has sown little fever.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the amendment to the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It was just a statement, not a statement.
This is not the first time that he has reminisced at such meetings in a humorous tone of the presidential election.
“In the worst case, or at best, you have seven and a half years with me,” he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His statements of the day before yesterday will not make him a candidate more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they make comments, it's because of the double truth.
Accelerating the path to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But this is not the entrance to the Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royale kolby<0xC5><0xA1>te, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to convict himself.
On the contrary, because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS want to arrange for combat teams rather premature than intended.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," the people in the prime minister's immediate and cautious surroundings said.
“If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, even with the obvious.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of state titles.
The last meeting of the Central Board of Governors in the year was supposed to be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for the recovery from the crisis or, at least, the announcement of the cessation of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations, which must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European receivables is binding, and the Securities Institute will no doubt not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation today already so tense on the European securities markets.
In this case, the political price would be even higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the Central European Bank in resolving the debts of European states.
She did not want to say whether she thought the bank could have done more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...). "
The night before, in Brussels, during its hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Commission, the President of the Central European Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more explicit in terms of his intentions, and was content to say that the program of buying state titles in the secondary market "continues" and that "we see" how "we do not proceed" during this.
The only certainty: the European Central Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the central bank’s purchases of bonds from the treasury have doubled to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion in the last week.
And because of the unreasonableness of the market negotiators, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts among the traders in the anticipation market about the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant exchange rate change.
If borrowing operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquid funds on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended by several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her agenda in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean accepting the risk of creating a short-term new tension,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“The progressive starting point announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely,” predicts Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the faint market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, they have no choice but to maintain their presence in the market.
“It needs at all costs to compensate for the lack of investors in the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the emergence of paid performance by the states that belong to the most fragile,” the senior bond manager said.
Because if interest rates go up, states will worry more about reducing their debt rather than stabilizing it.
It saves the euro at that price.
In Italy, Berlusconi's government is back.
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation has eased slightly, yesterday with a return on bond interest for 10 years.
A return to temporary rest.
At the end of the meeting with the minister for the economy, the presidents of the regions said they heard Giulio Tremonti qualify the situation as "unsolvable" and that he expects an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied to the participants.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest reached a record of 210 basis points, and the price of contracts for coverage against the risk of bankruptcy (CDS) flew up to 263 points, which caused some disturbance in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was more than 400 basic points.
But his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "turbulent market developments" and a possible infection originating in Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the eurozone’s third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and the lack of fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and puts it at risk of not being able to cover its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and at 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the government deficit will account for an additional 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (as opposed to 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor of a new set of amendments to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new tough measures will have to be taken," said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s board of directors under Italy’s pressure on the International Monetary Fund.
“There is no immediate problem, either short-term or long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization effort required in Italy is less than the effort required from other countries,” notes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at OCDE.
The issue of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, and after that elections could begin to be held, which are expected at the end of March.
This would mark the beginning of a period that is not suitable for taking a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this during a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidarity-minded, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s recorded expansion, regarding interest on European government bonds, brought water to the mill to governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The notation office of Standard & Poor's said it could degrade Portugal's debt record, a target that is most focused on by various speculations.
“Because in May, the real is not sufficiently transparent and obvious policy, mainly based on banking systems,” says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is slower than market time.”
Aware of this disconnected context and the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the already existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most affected by the problem and, on a broader scale, with their G20 counterparts are progressing very well.
This is taking into account the meetings of the Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and the Ecofin group from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the Central European Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries focusing on markets (see above).
As for the European Fund of Finance (FESF), its executive director, Klaus Regling, made a trip to Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of this journey is not to increase the funds, it certainly prepares the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected for next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by additional direct involvement in the FMI.
Countries such as Portugal and Spain are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly in terms of labour market organisation.
Reforms that join strict, fast-acting measures.
Lisbon and Madrid used a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid asking for international assistance at all costs before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting trust.
Finally, equity participants in European funds talk about the options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his trip to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea of whether the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-enter the stockpile of securities.
Economists from Barclays Capital, the actor of the very first European sovereign debt trading plan, believe that the addition of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would suffice, "preferably" in the form of a direct provision of financial liquidity.
The means exist: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidised to date by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
A council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange emergency.
Snow rations still cause transport difficulties, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties now have an orange emergency because of the risk of snow and ice.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres a la Vienne, joined the 20 districts that already have a declared orange emergency, 18 as early as Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne a la Gironde, later at night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfall causes problems in the north of la Gironde and the Charentes forest, and the Ile-de-France snowfall is mild.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, in places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, in places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
Snow surges are large enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt some economic activities, forecasts Metéo France.
On the coast of C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, some districts banned the passage of heavy goods vehicles - trucks over 7.5 tons with the route Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and the police recommend to go with your vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks was canceled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned for Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are envisaged to restrict freight transport.
The district office “calls on all car drivers to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt driving to the nature of the road”.
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Paris’ Roissy Airport and 10% at Orly Airport on Thursday due to expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services contact their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in the south of London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernization of transport in Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least during the discussion.
In particular, we recall the 23 billion for the metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
The state announced a subsidy of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion in order for the building to be put into operation.
Theoretically, this is an amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the funding from its dual source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which is being examined by the National Assembly's Finance Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms set out to secure these funds.
There are two: the creation of a special tax on equipment and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, Article 15, reads "in favor of the public institution of the Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The yield on this interest is 117 million euros per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the office rate, which already exists "in order to be modernized, to increase the revenue derived from it and to affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that cost?
Delusion.
This is not quantified in the text.
We're a long way from 4 billion.
“It is specified that these fiscal resources are attached to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of capital subsidy, which will be mobilized by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris according to the project,” we can read in the explanation of the reasons.
At SGP, this system does not seem shocking to us.
“From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then scrape up to 4 billion,” it explains.
"This will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP estimates that $4 billion will not be credited until 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This mechanism, in which the $4 billion promised belongs to the still absent subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on December 7.
Vengeful Hackers and Causing Investigators
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, there is an obvious scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future controlled by regression.
But let's keep things in order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press cuts.
The "extraordinary revelations" of Americans about Berlusconi's way of sex life are announcing what everyone has been able to read in any newspaper for months (all except these two Berlusconi own), and Kadhafi's infamous cartoon profile has long been a theme for cabaret artists for sketches.
The rule that secret documents should consist only of reports already known is fundamental in the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the riddle of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what was already written in previous works.
Not only because the author of occult texts does not like to look for new information (he does not even know where to look for reports about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is a lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) head of the secret services (and if he is not, he could, as I know, be an editor in the newspaper Libération) who considers only what he himself admits to be true.
The highly classified information about Berlusconi sent by the U.S. Embassy to the State Department was the same that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why is there so much concern about the disclosure of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that embassies, at least since the end of World War II and since the heads of state can make phone calls or fly away by plane for a joint dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in representation, have transformed into espionage centers.
Any viewer watching films about the investigation knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that this seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that this is being repeated publicly defames the duty of hypocrisy and casts a bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information of the most powerful country in the world is a hard blow, not a negligible one, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victim and his "executor".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell's day, it was possible to conceive of all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orwell's prophecy has been proven since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the wreath of power.
But when we demonstrate, as it is now, that even the "coffins" with the most secret information of the powerful can not resist the intervention of a hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a circular.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker - elected as a citizen's avenger - can know all the secrets of power.
How can one maintain a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that the true secret is a meaningless secret (and a meaningless secret will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious meaningless secret because it is drawn from public life; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, the secret of Hillary, the secret of all
WikiLeaks made no mistake with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the bestowed power so significant?
It is obvious that in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online - this would be equal to its publication on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, it is useless to hope that you can keep a secret message over the phone.
There is nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of state travelled by plane and made contact with one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know that for now my forecast belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who are discreetly transporting the fulfillment of formalities along uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages that they know by heart or rather hide rare information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored in unique copies in key-closed drawers: in total, the attempt to spy on the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving side by side, that is, backwards.
A century after wireless telegraphy revolutionized communications, the Internet rehabilitated wire-based telegraphy.
Video cassettes (analogues) allowed cinema lovers to shoot the film step by step, move it forward and backward and reveal all the secrets of the assembly, while now CDs (digital ones) allow only to jump through chapters, that is, through macropores.
Via high-speed trains, we will arrive from Rome to Milan in three hours, while for the journey by plane and transport, which includes we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is not unusual for politics and communication techniques to return to horse-drawn cars.
One last remark.
On another occasion, the press tried to understand what had been established in the secret of the embassy.
Now it's the embassies that are asking for confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France hacked its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test the compliance with the promises for quickly unlocked funding (speaked funding with a fast start or early start), implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been uncovered
In the Copenhagen Accord, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion for three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (that’s 420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled a big ace to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to funding a fast start: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operations are invaluable and valued for their true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to do the same and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, which puts it on the right track to deliver on its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion pledge in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we find that things are much more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is realised without compromising Public Development Assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international funding has been preserved and it adds 150 million to it for three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure of previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of d'Aide publique au développement.
In particular, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even be reduced), it is to comply with its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, think that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed is equal to 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be evidenced for some investments that are profitable (often these are projects associated with reducing emissions, consisting in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , we should not understand it as the equivalent of our obligations, but as the cost of a loan to a lender country.
But France can only provide this justification: it is "compliant" with its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million commitment, which makes up 91.5% of the loan (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>388.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify this for yourself.
It is the only country in the European Union that makes use of a loan on such a scale.
Germany claimed 46% from there, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) kept their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, if the absolute majority of the European Union gives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 to fulfill its promise, France will give only 10 centimes and considers this effort to be comparable.
What a beautiful piece of cake!
To sum up, in its financing of the “fast start” France operates with double deception: on the one hand, with the development of the stock over time, and on the other hand, with a real financial burden.
Although it spends only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it is able to convince that it spends <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million “new and additional” in connection with its promises.
The manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that although it is Bercy who made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the Member States continue to donate when only lending is enough?) and in negotiations, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this isn't our case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
France should first announce a change in its way of keeping records for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and decency and fairness towards other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussions on long-term financing deposits (another crucial chapter currently under discussion): we will not escape the question of "additionality" or the way in which loans are recorded.
France should change its position to become as progressive with these deposits as with the others.
Therefore, everyone puts hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans could raise the level of international confidence necessary to move forward in the discussions.
An alarm about pesticides that children ingest.
A 10-year-old child consumes 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Future Generations Association (ex-The Movement for Rights and Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which points out that its results "have no significant statistical value given the low number of analysed samples but are characteristic of the issues being processed," bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal as a light snack per child about a decade old in supermarkets in Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - as well as confectionery, were analyzed by research laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are considered carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are among the clear carcinogens, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to internally exfoliated glands (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, in our research we can well see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, perhaps carcinogenic, and/or PE is striking,” the association said.
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain in themselves about ten residuums with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as is the case with about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
An apple imported from Brazil, reported by the study as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya included in the lunch, for which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, minced meat steak, canned tuna, and even bread and chewing gum were spiked with pesticides and other chemicals.
In the tap water, the analysis revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
Salmon steak for dinner was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat food in the microwave did not escape analysis.
“The ultimate risk to consumers of this ‘contaminant cocktail’ is likely to be underestimated,” the study said.
The Ecological Europe-Greens Association (EE-LV) has proposed "face-to-face emergency" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the "increase in civilizational diseases".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
