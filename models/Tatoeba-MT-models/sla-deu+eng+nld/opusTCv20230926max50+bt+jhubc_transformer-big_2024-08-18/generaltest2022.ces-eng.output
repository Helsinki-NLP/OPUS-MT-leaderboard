The great return of the Czech loser is approaching.
Pavel French was called up to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel French, who has been going through a difficult period of his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen native will be on the switch and soon he could get to the goal.
The former goalkeeper of Litv<0xC3><0xAD>nov, Pilsen or Russian Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He was in the middle of a game with Vegas and hasn't played in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one pole to another.
“Pavel the Frenchman will be out for about three to four weeks with a lower-body injury,” the Denver-based unit said in early October.
His return to the NHL was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was called from a farm, where he caught four duels and showed his old form.
In the AHL, he accounted for 94.5% of the interventions.
The Pilsen hockey bred man finally wants to assert himself and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In his last year he had hip problems and in his shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francek" caught 36 matches, his success rate of interventions is at the number 92.3%.
Charles wears Camille's mask on Christmas card, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Britain’s Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during a trip to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also published his wish, using a photograph in which he helped his wife Camille to put on a mask at the races.
This was reported on its website by the British news agency BBC.
They send their wishes to friends, co-workers and foundations with whom they work.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in khaki color, and Princess Charlotte is wearing a dress.
Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, wears the same shorts as Prince George and Prince Louis and a shirt with a collar.
It is not clear who took the photo, William and Kate did not specify, nor is it clear exactly when it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a Christmas wish photo on a packet of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country house in Norfolk County.
The film, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also published by the heir to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured them in June at the races in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a mask on his face, helps Camille put on her mask, which is color-coordinated with a light dress.
Slavia, according to efotbal.cz, promised Berber a million for the title, Tvrdik denied it.
Prague – Criminals in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the fact that the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, Roman Berbr, was supposed to have been promised a million crowns from Prague’s Slavia for the league title in the 2018/19 season.
It was reported by the server efotbal.cz that he got to part of the police files.
The chairman of the board of the Vr<0xC5><0xA1>ovice club, Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k, said that the Red and Whites did not engage in any corruption negotiations.
The server published a transcript of police wiretapping, in which Slavia is mainly represented by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who ended up in the championship club last summer.
According to the file, the former influential official of the Red-and-Whites was in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of the then second-tier Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the defendants in the case.
The criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berber promised a financial reward for winning the title.
2019 SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) should receive a promised million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to criminologists, Berbr met not only with Nezmar, but also with the Chairman of the Board Slavia Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
According to the server, the file no longer shows whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The president rejected any corruption action.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the situation in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not sought to influence arbitrators in violation of fair play rules, and we have not provided anyone with any financial performance in this regard,” Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
In eavesdropping, among others, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k.
The cause of the alleged influence of matches through referees was unleashed last October by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest-ranking player in the affair is Berber, who no longer plays in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, like the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Rogoz was released from custody.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are the larping of the cold war.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (gunners must come out of the armored cabin and carry the cartridges by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, we have already managed to get rid of Praga V3S even in specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we produce and export abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have such a story.
I've got a hunt right next to town.
Nutrients climbed from the river and caused damage to the crops, so I sat there.
When I came in, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a mess, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before something came out, but of course the fox was gone in a moment.
I let her come 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost shit himself, waving his forehead on all sides, so I called him and said it was a fox.
By the time I got off the property, he was gone.
I mean, even a meadow can be a prusser.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it would have to be a lot of coincidences for something to happen, you'd probably be seen in the thermal vision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, expensive stuff put your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.

Home » Health » Respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for the purchase and distribution of masks, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns on their purchase in recent weeks.
The server iRozglas compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that during one day the amounts for the ventilator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which authorities have behaved economically?
And why did others buy the dredge?
Lenka Kabrhelov<0xC3><0xA1> speaks with the editor of iRozglaz Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1>.
I respect the soldiers and the army (I am not affected by the memories of Czechoslovakia that the older generations suffered), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory war.
We don’t even have large warehouses of technology that the trained can take up, we don’t actually have modern technology for existing professionals, and modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the abilities of the midfielders will rapidly lose their time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will occur very quickly, there will be no time to retrain someone.
And finally, pawnbrokers/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are going to lead, and it is also a stated necessity to deter the enemy.
On the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will take place only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will already be irrelevant, and we do not even have a suitable geography for this.
We don’t have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there's this situation that you're looking at a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, coming into the attack alone between two or even three Swiss and saying, "Tvl, what do you think is going to happen now?"
Of course, he is treated like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this skill of "leading the defender" is so terrible that I was surprised to see that our attacker was able to beat one player of the opponent.
The First Swallows
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting any major turnaround in the coming weeks.
The surge in hospitals, according to statistical models, will last for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the variant of the omicron, which is very likely to spread faster than the currently predominant Delta.
At the same time, it is impossible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, to what extent vaccination or post-infectious immunity obtained by previous experience of the disease helps against it.
This week, however, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the covid equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from the company Pfizer, which, from the results so far, reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it was said, the first to reach domestic patients is Merck's molnupiravir.
The company ended up on tape first even because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral disease of horses on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
But Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are used to saying "how our beak grew".
Look, you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no without hesitation.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and elect parties like the AfD.
Afraid of Cancel Culture, saying this in public means losing your job and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in surveys, West good, East bad.
But they'll really find out what people think.
In France alone, Le Pen and Zemmoura both accounted for more than 20 percent.
We even know that the objects are three in Czech and completely identical.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where everything is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Museum of Brda and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory, either for reasons of safety or speed of deployment of warheads due to the western position.
In those underground shelters (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the whole rocket, as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some supporting device.
Besides the museum maple, the remaining ones are desolate.
In the second grade of elementary school, we had a classmate Gypsy, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty cool, he made some good jokes, he often showed too much of himself, but he was such a mascot of ours.
Everyone had fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he was missing a little, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he did not steal snacks, he did not steal phones, he went cleanly dressed.
He also went to schools in the countryside, did various ape farms, but he was fine, hopefully never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies entered the same year, another class.
Shortly after, the teacher was beaten, the police were often dealing with something, threatening and threatening other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old things, something I do not need, etc.) and I have often sold to Gypsies, they always had money, they did not try to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like that, a guy called in a month that he had already rewrote it on himself.
I say to myself that I am not a racist, I do not care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or any other, as long as he behaves as he should in a decent society (works, works, women do not beat, just ordinary behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, takes out apartments and houses, he's just messed up, he's got problems... so it doesn't matter what color he's got, but he'll mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start a business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care, as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachatick<0xC3><0xA1>
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian paramedics.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The 18-year-old driver of a Peugeot vehicle was probably driving in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD><0xC3><0xAD>hovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet identified, drove in the opposite direction in a bend.
After the collision with the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended up on the roof off the road, described the accident by a spokesman for the South Bohemian police <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Schwarzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The young driver of the Peugeot suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was stuck in the car.
After his release, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in a stable condition he was transported by air to the <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice hospital, said rescuer Fajtlov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to parcels from outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
“Usually, it can be tens of dollars, say, from ten dollars up, where it is still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, the ordering of small parcels has increased slightly, he has to add VAT and send the data to the post office for customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail informing him that the customs officers are waiting for the package to arrive.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the consignment, and if the VAT was not included by the trader at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the consignment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not arrange the customs procedure himself, the carrier’s remuneration must also be added to the total amount.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a matter of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
However, not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of received shipments from abroad fell from 60,000 to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is that people do not respond to requests for data that are needed to complete the customs procedure.
At the moment, there are 30,000 parcels in international mail that we have to process.
If people filled in all the necessary data and filled them in in time, we would be about halfway there, says Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vit<0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for the Czech Post.
The solution to inflation
See the headline, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9 percent inflation and it is expected to continue to grow.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction in VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it is going?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you add (who is the employee)?
I’ve been added 2% in gross this year, which is a mockery, but fortunately I have a similar income from business that I run when I work.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why proven convicted rapists are sent to jail for only six months?
This just doesn’t bother me how a court can send such an animal to jail for only 6 months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relations and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim never has to recover from it again.
Wouldn't this and the potential future reporting of rape be a deterrent?
The man from the Tomb “burned” his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb inadvertently helped the officers secure his nationally wanted girlfriend from Kostomlat, to whom an arrest warrant was issued.
He himself called them to her.
He went around it.
At first, he approached the passer-by and made up a story that he had been robbed.
Officers arrived at the scene after calling the emergency line and were not surprised when the alleged “robber” told them that he had made up his mind to have the officers arrive at the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a complaint with the Czech Police.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers then found that the woman was on the wanted list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her arrest.
Therefore, the case is being solved by the PKK.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that Slavs are not ethnic or cultural anymore, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, of course, I agree with the meme, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague in the USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can actually believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
Personally, I would not consider such a case to be true faith.
Here with Pascal I can not agree, in the world there is an estimate, if I am not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should you choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in one of the thousands of religions there is at least one god who will indecently punish you if you believe in another god.
But even in the Ten Commandments it is said that there is no god but the Lord.
Wouldn’t it be more rational in that case to abstain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of the thousands of gods and sending me to hell or some other place for that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in the reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the command of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
All parts of the A<0xC4><0x8C>R could use something like this.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can talk like this: the cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly waning, companies are hunting in schools, and there is a kind of fusion, where the labor force is migrating from educational institutions to employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is ongoing, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
A similar intersection should also work between the civilian and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build a kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that a Russian, a German or even a Mongol invader will never invade here again.
I find it funny how you consider NATO to be something carved into stone, we have allies and they will defend us if there is a problem.
Well, please, man.
All it takes is one election in the U.S. to round up their budget, and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The British will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already once shown that it is enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long worked as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military technology of its time.
And today, every teenager can pilot remotely controlled means, so whatever it takes.
We don't need a border fortification, that's a shame today, but a playful teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Unpack your gifts under the Christmas tree and suddenly you are at home stuffed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is again used by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of the shops that your used boxes will welcome has been created.
And not just at Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved store (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains almost 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated, and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently lacking in the market and also saved money, as the packaging carton has increased by 50% over the last period.
In the eyes of ecologically minded customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One of such stores is Tierra Verde, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco cosmetics.
Boxes and filling materials are brought to Pop<0xC3><0xB3>vek near Brno by individuals who accumulate at home, but we also hear from companies with whom we have arranged regular pick-up of deferred cartons.
We will use everything when packing parcels from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for future generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1> from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only sampling points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over past medicines, tires, used electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All garbage can end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such sites.
“Increasingly, there are collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise become waste,” adds Miroslav Kub<0xC3><0xA1>sek, one of the authors of the application from the association Let’s Clean the Czech Republic.
It seems rather bad to me that nowadays the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there was a problem (mainly in English articles) that university students do not understand the principle of components on a computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple photo apps, or actually mobile phones in general, simply hide that underlying filesystem with folders and throw everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but most importantly, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Before the weekend, Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU presidency – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke for more than an hour, during which he unveiled the presidency’s logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they could not be done in six months.
French politicians love it, and so do the voters.
Macron’s proponents of a split between the right and the left agree on little, but they do in Europe.
And in France, there will be a new election of the head of state in April.
The election calendar has also affected the priorities themselves.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work of historians.
A number of commentators immediately rushed in with criticism that Macron was talking about pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, they are trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French president, <0xC3><0x89>ric Zemmour, is now traveling around France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries often learn history as a story we versus them and never as a story of the whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they do not have an enlightened cantor, they will no longer know what the broader context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which goes back to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won awards for director and best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held the first place in the audience rankings.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins for his film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being sick" I had diarrhea for a couple of days and didn't feel like smoking...
Compared to the flu, it was worse.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only a personal experience. I'm not saying that's how everyone has it)
Christmas book tips
The Christmas double, which will be released on December 20, will contain a traditional literary appendix.

Those who have stayed and those who have left know too little about themselves to spend on living together.
Trains begin to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday, trains start to run on the railway according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some lines, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to run instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, only the departure time is adjusted, or their route is slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The sale of tickets began in the autumn.
Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger trains per day in the new timetable, with an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
In addition to domestic routes, the new timetable will also run to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main novelty will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be delivered by the carrier in northern Moravia or in western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase fare prices by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Roads take inflation into account in their tariffs every year.
The biggest change in the timetable of RegioJet is the entrance to the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k – Nymburk – Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n.
After the success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport, the carrier will replace the Czech Railways.
On a daily basis, RegioJet will tell a total of 16 connections, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at stations Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>r nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou and Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to the spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the carrier tried to maintain the most similar driving times of its long-distance trains despite the planned shut-off works.
Without major changes, Arriva trains and other carriers should continue to operate.
The carrier will also be exchanged on some regional routes.
Passengers are waiting for the changes, for example in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa, where the Trilex trains of the German company Die Landesbahn will run on the route from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav via <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Rumburk instead of the Czech Railways.
For the second year, passengers will also be able to use the single rail fare.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflationary 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Are we not learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they were oppressed, how they had to work, how they were dying.
I have never in my life heard teaching from the point of view of the slave party or since then, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one in school will teach you that the colonizers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they will only tell you how brutally we Europeans murdered them, killing each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the U.S., directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I have not seen anyone intentionally cover up the facts, but I have heard before that this is happening and I think it is a problem, I do not deny it (for example, in Japan, the atrocities from WW2 are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today's perspective, without understanding.
History is not interested in one’s feelings, it is just what it is, and I think it is a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at the thing of the time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never do this again.
By the way, speaking of the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they too had some good achievements and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as many people nowadays idealize it.
And a lot of people forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, and even our view does not exist in them (on YT there was also a video from TV, where they heard someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous at U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of Communism, something their country had never experienced.
Overall, it seemed to me that at some universities it was terrible, those students were quite radicalized, and those schools supported them on how many occasions.
And if I imagine that these people will one day be much older, I'm a little sick of this being the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that perhaps feminism has already achieved what it had, and it is no longer about the same thing, it has radicalized itself.
Currently, feminists are those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, when it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
The more radical someone is, the more you can hear them.
In any case, in conclusion, I also did not encounter anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I had a bad geography, but that was mutual. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn’t do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something connects me with people so interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek Catholic parishes, one Ukrainian and the other Slovak.
The Slovak pastor is a very nice man, he has a sermon on theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks up some cock about the coronavirus, that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholic but go to the Hussites because it is theologically very similar, but the members are usually more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanick<0xC3><0xA1> Street.
St. Michael’s Church in the Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 3:00 p.m. they do Mass in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
The flame of Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – A flame ignited in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
Scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav border crossing.
It was also taken at the border last year.
Bethlehem Light is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we participate in every year, and I look forward to it.
It is an honor for me to have been chosen, said scout Am<0xC3><0xA1>lie Alarm to the present journalists.
While last year the handover took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing at the parking lot.
Usually for him, the scouts take the train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of flames in the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally set off by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrle.
On Saturday, December 18, scout couriers will take care of the subsequent distribution of light, which will travel by selected express trains and passenger trains.
From them, local scouts or volunteers will take the light at the stations, who will then continue to spread flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, scouts must comply with existing measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's happening just like last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear masks, try to observe distances, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing colleagues, simply to behave in a way that was as safe as possible, said Zuzana Hrbkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesperson for the Bethlehem Light event.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread simultaneously with the flame the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For believers, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, the flame is also a symbol of selflessness and human reciprocity.
All news, including the list of places where people can come for a flame, can be found on the website www.betlemskeslusto.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that prove that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidy as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education make proper use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is spent on agriculture, industry and companies in general.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it disrupts the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I myself work in a factory where a million signs are "xy funded/co-financed by the xy project" in the corridors and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the impediment of development when this company is both holding on and taking orders/employees from companies that could grow after its demise and be more productive.
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age also gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that Internet ads do not move with me, but then I find that they have influenced me too - it's just so tricky that you can't always resist it.
This is also why I support the radical voices in the European Parliament, which currently want to ban programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the words of the classics - I would ban the Internet.
I have a feeling that this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that most people believe and makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion, which I’ll argue is critical thinking.”
“I won’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
Televisions have dropped the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of two hundred of them this year
Los Angeles – Movie theaters, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have fallen short of the trend of Christmas movies, and this year they will present a record-breaking more than two hundred of them to their viewers in the premiere.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
In recent years, the genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been scoring and significantly increasing the audience, which is why more and more of these films are being created.
This year, four times as many Christmas movies were made as in 2011, and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those pictures that have the word Christmas in their title, so in reality there will be much more holiday films.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, and the films Home Alone, Love in Heaven or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular worldwide.
However, the real boom of Christmas pictures began only in 2009, when a special film series came to the American cable TV station Hallmark, recalled the BBC.
Her Advent project, called Countdown to Christmas, included four films at the time and was very successful.
This year, the station began to tune its viewers on Christmas Day on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, the competing Lifetime station has 35 new Christmas-themed films on its program, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix contribute to the total.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter so much, the important thing is that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it snows,” Brandon Gray, author of I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies, told The New York Times.
“For the audience, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel at least a little calm for two hours in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray said.
According to him, for example, TV Hallmark still uses the same recipe for his films, which is uniform, but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then there will be a misunderstanding about half an hour before the end, which, of course, will be resolved successfully and the two will kiss.
This is how it goes all the time, and as long as all the movies look alike and have a similar atmosphere, people are watching one after the other, Gray adds.

Only nineteen drivers will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on Covid-19 and will not reach the final race of the season.
Stan Haas will only send one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he was supposed to attack the better position from the 20th place, which he went in the qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from the Haas stables will not reach the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for Covid-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the grid, and Mazepin’s teammate Mick Schumacher, from the first Max Verstappen, will compete with Lewis Hamilton in the direct battle for the title.
Mazepin, according to Haas, is relatively well and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because he was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," the company said in a statement.
He will not send a replacement rider to the Haas race, nor can he.
A possible substitute would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first race.
Kimi Räikkönen had the COVID-19 at the start of the season and last year was tested positive by Sergio Pérez <0xC4><0x8C> Lewis Hamilton.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's a bit like a portable jewellery store, and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, at home we never wore much sweaters,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over his work in six months.
Silk was bought in Italy, 24 carat gold thread in France and 2000 decorative crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars were decorated with 150 diamonds.
"The basis is wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which, however, does not recommend washing.
And there's one more catch.
“I’m completely broke, I have to sell the sweater as quickly as possible,” he admits.
If it succeeds, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater ever sold five years ago cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

The government has approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Female pilots, explorers and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, with the mission approved for six months.
They are supposed to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO states in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with a false promise of easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already active on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in the south of Moravia?
Hygiene examines another case of a child from Adamov.
“We currently have another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov Elementary School has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There were six cases in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Health Institute in Prague,” the director said.
She added that they are two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, as well as two eleven-year-old pupils of Adamov Elementary School.
There is no connection between the Brno and Adamov cases.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four asymptomatic course.
No one with a suspicion of Omicron travelled abroad
None of them have traveled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they contacted anyone who has been abroad.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to ban the sale and production of some weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial abortion law after detecting an embryo’s heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation in a lawsuit against anyone who makes or sells assault rifles and homemade firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to Friday’s ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court, which left Texas’ abortion ban in effect, even as it goes against a nearly 50-year-old precedent ruling that established the right to abortion across the U.S. by about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court did not now decide on the constitutionality of the entire law, but rather on the technical issue arising from the innovative construction of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban was passed on to the public in this case, making it impossible for the Texas Republicans to attack him by the usual court route.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (Friday) decision by the United States Supreme Court, which allowed the Texas ban on most abortion services to be maintained and largely supported the Texas manoeuvre to protect its law,” the governor said.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” Newsom continues.
He instructed his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice, to work on measures that would authorize representatives of the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This refers to homemade weapons that do not have serial numbers and can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim compensation of at least $10,000 (over $220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute, or sell assault rifles, “ghost weapons” components, or sets to make them in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these horrific weapons off our streets is to create a threat of private prosecution, then that’s exactly what we should do,” he said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, it would confirm the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor, who warned in a dissenting opinion on Friday’s majority verdict against extending the legal mechanism to other U.S. states.
However, the Supreme Court did not grant the Texas abortion ban full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to pursue lawsuits against elected officials in the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where the vaccine schedule is gradually figured out and the vaccines themselves are improved based on the results.
For example, from Israel, there is already a large-scale study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination scheme over time, but it is too early for that.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer’s specifications promises up to 10 times more effectiveness, should be launched soon.

Poland threatens to stop payments to EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act against the law if it used the new powers and stopped the payment of money to Poland due to the rule of law dispute.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU fund to restore economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies to countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU veto of blackmail on all issues that require unanimity," said Ziobro, the head of the small Solidary Poland party, without whose votes the current government would lose its narrow majority in the Sejm.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU unlawfully denies us funds from the common budget, to which we also contribute, the Polish minister added.
His party takes a more radical stance in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that Polish justice has undergone under Ziobro’s rule threatens its independence and subordinates it to politicians.
According to Ziober, Brussels is building "impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland".
Warsaw faces "a political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles," Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on a government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never make concessions to Brussels that would limit Poland's sovereignty.
“We will never agree that Poland should have the status of a colony,” he said.
But to be clear about it... In our town of Lidl, they have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look at other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk racks I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector all the selected, less common and special cheeses were, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If there is avoidance, I don’t even smell in any market, no action, no gold shop in the square, they may not have that choice, but they usually have everything I need and it has some order, so I’m done in ten minutes.
I went to Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't care anymore.
For two years, I've been watching data being treated like manure here, most of the opponents of vaccination are just a little more out of the bowl than most of the supporters of vaccination.

When I was a child, I was punished with a boil.
It was never because of the grades, usually it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (she read instead of going to bed, wrestling with her brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened at first that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after another "grabbing" the cooker just brought it and put it down so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a few blows to my ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in a reasonable manner and to an extent) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than words.
In my opinion, the warning part is important, because it gives the child a way to choose whether to disobey and get it, or to improve and there will be no punishment.
In the end, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defending the system
When a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl answered a journalist’s question in 1999 about what the Czech Constitution meant to him – whether the sacred charter he swore on and learned about at school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that could be changed if necessary, he definitely leaned towards the first concept.
Once in the Constitution we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with the changes it is better to save.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voted the question at the time.
More and more recently, however, lawyers have come to the view that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
For years, it has been tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not have foreseen, such as the behavior of a directly elected president.
On one thing, however, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be thought out.
The Constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies throughout history face.
The Constitution is, among other things, a kind of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the rules of the game for politicians.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians to prohibitions.
At the same time, however, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to exercise their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they are fighting for the life of a few months old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder for children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with recently.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, they are talking about 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said Petr Dominik, the head of the Department of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation at the Brno University Hospital and the Faculty of Medicine at Masaryk University.
The course is much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are seriously ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the last period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the Children's Infectious Diseases Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on ARU.
Children with postcovidal syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"There is now an increase in children with acute Covid pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires a stay on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects both adolescents and babies of several months apart from adults.
In hospitals there are also children in serious condition due to the coronavirus.
“Currently, a child of several months and adolescence lies with us,” the prime minister said.
He is pleased, however, that no child deaths have been recorded in the children's hospital of FN Brno so far.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 years died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, in a children's hospital - not only in the coronavirus department - an integral part of the cooperation of a psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, both in adults and in children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of postcovidal syndrome.
"Therefore, the administration of a vaccine dose is also recommended in children," the doctor added.
In the rest zone, you can only walk along the marked paths.
But the rest zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on map.cz.
Generally, in national parks outside the rest zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not climb over the fence into the fields).
Skiing / cycling in the woods outside the marked paths is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so much guarded outside the national parks).

China builds the impression of managed disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better
Sinologist Jirou<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression of a controlled disease and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has launched a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing echoed criticism for failing to stop the outbreak, which has turned into a global pandemic.
Now the country is reporting a zero-increase in infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protection aids, and Chinese doctors are helping in many ways to fight the coronavirus, for example in the worst-hit Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
He meets a friend of a friend and says to him, "Hey, don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because she saves the grass, washes the car with a trunk, children play with it.
Well, that's great.
If you want $5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
I'll bet you're right, it'll be great...
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant???
The lawn is shattered, there's giant shit everywhere, the car's gone, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get divorced.
The one who sold it says, "You're not talking about elephants, you're not selling elephants like that."
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, they are the superpowers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a great power only if it works on its integration.
It still operates at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalisation.
Not in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the moods will be different and it will work.
I thought of it too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in English, so maybe I'll just say something.
I just assume that the ellipse usually includes two different units at the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary on "Spanish oranges and tangerines", where it is clear that these are both from Spain, while for "Spanish fruit and tangerines" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the sentence is "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that this is already included in the broad term and there is no need to specify it further with the US forces.
Again, maybe just a word. :D
Either way, it's a pointless request.
In Tokyo, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of five.
Tokyo and surrounding areas were hit by a 5.0-magnitude earthquake on Sunday.
Witnesses said buildings in the capital were shaking, but no damage has been reported so far.
No tsunami warning was issued, Reuters reported.
Vicki Holland from Britain tortured hairy monkey Milly
The frightening images show the moment when the frightened monkey squinted in the toilet bowl before her heartless owner flushed her and laughed at her.
Holland's monkeys also fed sausages, kebabs, and hamburgers, regardless of her actual nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate's Court has now banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun reported.
The monkey rehabilitation experts who took care of Milly after her abuse said they had never seen such a frightened furry creature before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating Monkey World staff in Dorset, and is now playing with another rescued monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother has pleaded guilty to two counts of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrates' Court, she was sentenced to a 12-week prison sentence with a suspended sentence of one year.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, granted a life ban on animal husbandry and had to pay 12,000 crowns of legal costs.
Small Monkeys team leader who rehabilitated the abused animal, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue even further.”
It took Milly to get used to people again.
She shrugged and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now, when she settles down and is satisfied with the male, the look at new people can still cause panic.
The psychological scars from the abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly’s bullying came to light after police in Gwent discovered frightening footage of her wife’s phone after a raid on her apartment on drug charges.
In the pictures, you can hear Milly swearing vulgarly.
In another video, Holland's monkey offers cocaine and says, "Do you want cocaine?"
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possession of cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house was found cocaine for 1600 pounds (in the amount of less than 50 thousand crowns) hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently jailed for 30 months and Hollande was given a suspended sentence of 20 months.
And what wonderful concepts will you learn from this prehistory three times in a row if you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same things as you did in sixth grade?
And it's all killing the idea of bluffing, where no one, except for the exceptions, cares if you can do it or understand it.
First, write a test for 1 and then no one cares.
Go and randomly ask people on the street if they can determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation and the coefficients.
Everyone's been through this, and the absolute majority won't even strangle themselves and tell you they're totally in the shit.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I am a big fan of general overview and the reality is that people do not want and do not need.
And in that moment, it's useless, and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it's learning for a lot of people who need something.
But like, the remark that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I meant it all seriously... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly getting to the time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably what our communist past and the persecution against the educated and elites are all about) But the cost of having barbarians in the machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, Covid probably never reached these dimensions.
Wedding at a Glance: The War of Kadri and Andrea Continues!
Which is the main reason she can't leave Switzerland right now," Andrea said on Instagram in Stories, responding to questions from curious fans about Kadrim's disappointment that she decided to cut off all contact and even block it on social media.
It's been between Kadrim and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move with her, at least until she returned to the Czech Republic permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end in love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was furious with Kadri's turn in response to Andrea's accusations of lies, gambling, and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now disliked his younger sister Linda.
She decided to speak to her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't talk about these things at all, and even in our family, we've never said much extra to each other about these things.
I certainly don't want to cause any regrets.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, he just won't let me!
I am sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrim for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it the most, even at a young age.
I am even more sorry when I have to read such false information, which is probably quite taken out of context.
I would like to wish everyone to know Kadri as much as I do, our loved ones and family, stand in a confession in response to Andrea’s words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, she added vaguely.
The drunken thief climbed up the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Chao began his looting campaign in a parking lot in a residential area, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole from one vehicle in the amount of less than 330 crowns.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
A video from a security camera then shows him walking down the street away from the crime scene while eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
Chao was subsequently detained.
The man confessed to drinking alcohol on the day of the incrimination.
And since he needed the money, in drunkenness he decided to rob.
The whole thing is still under investigation.
The drunk climbed up the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The pandemic law is time-limited and effective due to pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.
The law restricts the scope of business.
That's not good enough for you?
The right to assemble will be limited, but not revoked.

They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead citizen or a foreign politician?
I think you know all this stuff that people are writing to you.
You're just playing dumb to have someone to argue with.
If not, it is sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, it bothers me how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it had accumulated, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, for example, the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: believe in spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell with his head down from 12 meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
An unbelievable fall survived on Sunday night a man in Ostrava, in which rescuers of the regional Medical Rescue Service intervened.
Officers of the regional operational center received an emergency call one hour after Saturday midnight with initial information about the fall of a man from a height.
Two crews of ZZS – medical and medical – immediately departed for the place.
Upon arrival, the paramedics found that a 27-year-old man was supposed to fall from a window about 12 meters high and hit concrete with his head!
There was coal in V<0xC3><0xAD>tkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial lung ventilation and after further measures as part of pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance transported him to the next care of the Ostrava Traumatology Center, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Humpl, a spokesman for the ZZS MS of the region, informed.
I am more worried than I am about the coronavirus because of the inadequate responses of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but doctors and medical staff are at the forefront of the fight against the disease.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking the military doctor David Rezac.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA experienced a great gala evening full of interesting results.
In the UFC 269 tournament, there was a lot going on.
Outsider Julianna Penova managed to defeat the legendary wrestler Amanda Nunes, who for seven years did not find the slayer.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in a light weight, he performed a great throttling against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The winner was also Kai Kara-France, who quickly knocked out Cody Garbrandt with a technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also beat his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
This brought a bantamweight women's match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pena.
The American entered the battle as an imaginary "dwarf", because Nunes has not lost for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started the road to victory very actively and even gave the opponent a push kick, which sent her to the ground.
Peneva, however, did not allow herself to be forced to make any more mistakes and unsuccessfully tried to attack herself with a lever on her arm.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals have enjoyed a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Pene got Nunes to the ground, where she began to strangle her.
She had to give up and break the attack.
She was shocked when she became a new champion.
The highlight of the gala was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for the lightweight title.
At first, Poirier did better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the latter he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on the hand.
He didn't do that very well, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, put his opponent on his back, and stabbed him with a series of blows.
He won the second round.
In Oliveira's third round, he showed a rear naked choke, which Poirier resisted for a while, but then had to knock off the throttle.
The Brazilian defended the title, Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he was credited with the sovereign triumph of Sean O'Malley, who already in the first round put a hard right back on Raulian Paiva.
Subsequently, he struck him with a series of precision strikes and recorded his fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now after seven years, she lost.
The hip or the hip?
At first glance, it's not complicated.
The majority of nouns in Czech express only one grammatical gender, and therefore it is not difficult for them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle gender.
But then there is also a fairly numerous group of nouns, for which the genus is not stable.
Such nouns fluctuate between two families.
When tilting, they then acquire two endings and in some cases remain in an inflexible form.
For example, the words "helix" or "hip" are male and female, in the first they are tilted according to the pattern of "machinery", in the second according to the pattern of "song".
For another group of nouns, there are different shapes already in the first case of a single number, for example: "row/row", "kedluben/kedlubna" or "potato/potato" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is incompatible, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "trench" and "trench", "donut" and "donut", etc.
Some words that penetrated into the Czech language from other languages were initially inflexible, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained unsteady in the middle generation, but in the male it has endings according to the pattern of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
Tensions are mounting at the Greek-Turkish border over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to turn to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.

We haven’t seen the blue sky in three months and were suffocating, says Sydney journalist
The devastating wildfires that Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do local authorities and residents cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government have done more to prevent drastic impacts, as critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That is why everyone is always written about everywhere.
It is unpleasant for people to deal with how sexual violence looks in our society and how widespread it is, so they try to forget it.
I don't know anyone who was falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how their surroundings or even the police often treat these people.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
Too many people keep it to themselves.
Yes, there are those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s disgusting and spit in the face of all victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “a large part of the accusation is fabricated” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods houses, families don’t have the money to finish
Building material prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
Many people are in a difficult situation because of this.
She does not have the means to complete her house and the banks refuse to increase her mortgages.
In addition to the price of materials, the price of construction works also increases.
People don’t have enough money to complete their existing homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgages, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
At best, people move to dismantled and unschooled homes.
In the worst case, the houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay their mortgages and rents,” says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two to three family houses in a year, and at fifty percent it happened to us.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to comply with certain things contractually, even if the material has become more expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people are going to have financial problems.
If they were counting on the construction of the house going to be five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some will wait,” added Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
Copper, iron and plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
But construction companies are also struggling with labor shortages.
In the Czech Republic, there is a shortage of graduates in construction and the influx of foreign workers is hampered by pandemics.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issue of a building permit is more favorable.
“Building authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” said K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We're fine, and we're gonna be even better.
But real visions are missing, says CRO commentator – mujRozglas
Entering the new year in addition to classical celebrations, traditionally accompanied by speeches of politicians.
This year, apart from Prime Minister and President Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies spoke to the nation.
What fundamentals have we learned?
As in this, I think the graduate is super just, I have my own topic, which I have chosen, I follow up on the bachelor's degree, I always work on it all year round and then in a week or two I will write a written part.
The statesmen are completely at peace with us, if a man is not a total macaque and something is left in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily choke him on the theory.
For example, I studied at state schools for a week, and when I was at the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which immediately came to me and I was right.
Otherwise, for those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it many times, really useful, they learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and have it taken care of.
In my opinion, it is great when at the end of the course there is an exam that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just a defense.
But don't overwhelm emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You're gonna be a dick like them.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of Pu Bear.
Maybe put it on Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta throws sticks at artists.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reach will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, it still changes which function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
I've been getting a lot of shit lately, so maybe I'm going to have to cut back on the tit-tocks, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't seem to let it happen.
In the end, I’d like to see something user-friendly that doesn’t suck all the creativity and energy out of the artists.
Statement of the Party of Workers in Donbas
The Union – yes, the break-up – no, the opponents of the break-up of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years after the illegal destruction of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the greatest geopolitical disaster in human history occurred.
Boris Yeltsin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal authority and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an openly lenient attitude of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, secretly, regardless of the people, signed an agreement that "the Geopolitan Union as a subject of the USSR
With one pen cut, they “cancelled” a vast country of nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnically Russian citizens found themselves abroad.
Since the early 1990s, Russia’s population has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars combined!
Previously, the same people who in one sitting in the Bia<0xC5><0x82>owie<0xC5><0xBC>a Forest destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They consciously de-industrialized, halted agriculture, broke away from the world’s largest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically merged into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the poverty of the population, the disintegration of the economy, science, the army, the growth of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the disintegration of Yugoslavia into the Arab Spring.
There is such a concept in political science as a “vacuum of power”.
Everything that was quickly betrayed and given up was quickly filled and conquered by NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And to this day, the whole world is shaken mainly by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not necessarily directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it dinner on Thursday.
In an alternative reality, in which I do not buy the meat on Monday, the chain will discount it to 99 CZK / kg on Tuesday - describe to me the mechanism by which this meat will become a burden for my digestive system by changing its price?
Or do I wait until Thursday and the meat will be discounted to CZK 69 / kg 1 day before the consumption date - how would this meat differ from what I bought on Monday for CZK 120 and left it in my fridge for 3 days?
I'll answer for myself - nothing.
This nonsense that if something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, spoiled or of poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
Now I recently went to Hlavas in Brno and in the underpass the ladies were handing out a brochure, I always take things like this to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of peasant reason and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nothing about God, I was confused, but I knew it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading it, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, like it was a good piece of shit, full of totally useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash up and not be a dick.
It is a pity of the paper, because of this, the forests would not have to be cut down.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychological manipulation and emotional blackmail will make you do it because you like it without realizing how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and on her knees begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she began to physically block the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then another six months went by and she started to be beaten on a stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her I was breaking up and lied to her, but that we could still talk about it next week to calm her down and not to catch any amok again.
Such a person sucks out of you feelings, emotions and overall joy.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are being looted furiously by buying a cloud of tests and rushing to the positive, who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease if it weren't for the test.
All we're getting is a complication for companies, carriers, and more, because their employees have been under house arrest for five days in a random number generator.
In the West, they've already stopped the clownish thing, and they've recognized that there's no point in solving a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, War is new and he has to steal something and drive his ego by inventing buzzwords.
I see the good old bastard coming back to us again.
After several years of suppression and suppression of this dishonest business, MLM recruiting is back on the rise again.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, first year at the university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly turned into "you don't care, just get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products that I offer, because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and talk.
When the first money came in, you quickly realized that if you want to make money, you have to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only profitable, that is, one felt like a house seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned that one should not jump on every spike and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they certainly will not boast of expensive consumer goods or "fat" accounts.
I've never seen a lot of that in a corporation where I do.
HR is calm, managers look after their management and they don’t stick their nose into anything.
Regular evaluation is somehow happening, in the form in which it takes place in our country it is quite possible (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what turned out and what did not) - it is more self-evaluation than that someone would evaluate you according to some numbers, and the like.
Corporate activities are also optional.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes one feels that we are such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a large corporation no.
But it works so it doesn't bother us much as long as there are results.
A Czech woman missing in Britain has died.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly a decade, British police have been searching for a missing 32-year-old Czech woman who went missing in late November.
On Sunday, 12 December, the Minister of Foreign Affairs Jakub Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek announced on social networks that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, British police confirmed this afternoon to our London office that they had found the body of a missing Czech national.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information on the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulh<0xC3><0xA1>nek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on a bus on her way from work on November 28, when she was supposed to collect money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was reported by colleagues from work five days later.
The London police then began searching for her, and Interpol placed her among the missing people around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police arrested a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case, and what he suspects, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, four new councillors were appointed.
On Saturday, 11 December, in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a na Uhersk<0xC3><0xA1> Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice na Mostecko, Nov<0xC3><0xA1> Ves na Liberecko and Rovn<0xC3><0xA1> na Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsko, new representative offices were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen under the statutory number or the elected representative offices here have fallen apart.
There were 99 candidates running for 28 seats in the new elections.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the municipality of Rovn<0xC3><0xA1>, where 93.62 % of eligible voters voted.
The mandate was won by 8 women and 20 men.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate lists were registered for the new elections to the representative offices in these four municipalities.
Thirty-six women and 63 men applied for 28 seats.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather difficult but successful year.
In it, there were four new or repeated elections to municipal councils and, above all, very closely watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
Eva Krumpov<0xC3><0xA1>, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said that we had to work in more demanding epidemiological conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security.
The last constituency was processed on Sunday, December 12 at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Election Commission and, after approval, will be published in the Collection of Laws.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
It took me a while to cope with the fact that we have a rather dangerous contagious disease at the very beginning, but it went without much trouble.
To cope with how idiotic a large part of the population on all its strata is, I have a problem with it so far.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not bastards.
He would be deprived of the office of president and the capacity to re-acquire it.
The chances of this actually happening are very small, as others have said.
Besides, I'm not sure if the defamation of the file could be considered treason at all.
Treason is an act by which the President of the Republic jeopardizes the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Growing Numbers of People Under 35 Without Sex All Year Long
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religiously based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who renounced sex life increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they hadn’t had sex in the past year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of these could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher unemployment rate.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex a lesser and lesser priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, there has been a rapid increase in the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who report having not had sex in the previous year,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In married people, sexual activity is more common, in 2021 only 5% of them reported having no sex in the last year.
For single people, it was 29%, and Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious establishment also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although spouses are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that they’re a minority among single individuals in this age group, but their behavior shifts that trend,” Stone says of the 30 percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital intercourse, the reason is religious foundation.
Since 2008, single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month have increased their abstinence rate from 20 percent to nearly 60 percent.
Among the “lesser believers,” the trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent, Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and, above all, social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby “replacing” this need.
This trend has mainly caught on behind the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole of ordering Covid vaccines is about whether a society should force a portion of the population to behave that they don’t want but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question that I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don’t order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly be responsible for the death of an 80-year-old man who did not really know much, we did not explain it well to him, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he did not get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of a hardened opponent of vaccination, who here, along with the SPD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>, shouts something about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it can be quite clearly assumed that most of the unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the latter group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to combat drought?
This winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
Operators of ski resorts can not do without technical snow, the weather complicates, for example, the preparation of the cross-country Jizera fiftieth.
Is this a trend or an exception?
And what will a little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I have a story to tell, but it's not about the buffalo.
One day in high school, a teacher led us across town to the yard so we could take a boat ride down the river.
On the way there, we walked down a fairly wide street, and we don't see anyone in the middle - followers of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course they fell on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but they got into a conversation with a friend.
When she left, we asked her and her teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul,” she replied.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the shipyard.
We're so spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honours by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
"We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations," Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the Chancellor, the crisis caused by the troop movements at the Ukrainian border should be resolved through diplomatic negotiations, including within the “Normandy Group”, which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we record a hundred attempts to (illegal) cross the border.
He discussed further sanctions with the chancellor so that Lukashenko’s regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
According to DPA, Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoys German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
Drunk Polish nun blames accident, tries to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When police told her she could still lose her driver’s license if she did not give priority to driving and was taken away from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 reported.
She confessed that another nun had hit the vehicle and asked her for help.
The police then came for Sister Celestine.
She was forged by a breath test, and after discovering that she had more than two promilles in her blood, she was immediately stripped of her driving license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess to her actions in court.
Dog Hugo is doing his best.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> did not watch his film.
Czech creators of family comedies starred in American stories about dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the laws of filmmaking.
After F. Brabce Gump - the dog that taught people how to live, the audience's emotions in the cinemas now get another film Here we watch.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> Jr. loosely follows up on his previous film Here I Watch (2012).
The talking dachshund Hugo and some famous characters around him return to the scene.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava guesthouse, who nods, and so they begin to invite the dog-sitters, Julie's father with his partner, and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (who is also a producer of the film) were already struggling with the narrative procedures in the previous dog film, but at least the children and the dog had fun there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario that elicits a mixture of amazement and feelings of embarrassment.
Let's take a look at it.
Julie, although a scientist, succumbs to the desire for a child's self-immolation in the procession of a child's murky delusion, and if the right "constellation" comes, she copulates with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are just determined - on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course during the ongoing excursion with a local guide), retired colonel Mojm<0xC3><0xAD>r vym<0xC3><0xAD>t
Nothing against the purification treatment of nature and the power of pets.
The owners know why they have them.
But the viewer is astonished at what content pelmel, full of unbelievable situations and figures, was needed for this message.
A pair of staff robbers, a competition of dog breeders, a <0xC5><0xA0>umava charlatan, cops who come to the scene to look for “drugs” and discuss herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and who, of course, are drunk by a baked family in a pension.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma, and then sits on the family table with a cigarette and demands her father's whiskey and flats as a cured vegetarian, one cannot laugh.
On top of that, the creator explains to the viewer that “sometimes after a coma it happens.”
Shaimovich’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with text, the ability to build load-bearing situations, a sense of character as well as point and direction.
The acting performances are unbalanced, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is stifled.
No matter how hard Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Vacul<0xC3><0xAD>k, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>kov<0xC3><0xA1> or Nela Boudov<0xC3><0xA1> try to stand up to their party, they don’t have much to play for.
The only positive feature of the film remains the poetic shots of the nature of <0xC5><0xA0>umava cameraman Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Holomek and a pair of dachshunds.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a sluggish plot and dog proverbs, let alone the more popular vulgar expressions that the characters perform.
The argument is not even the long-term membership in the Daisies Breeders Club - as in the case of the producer.
Good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of man with a dog must also be knowledge of craftsmanship, if one wants to tell a believable story.
This failed in this case.
There is a little too much eroticism and a minimum of affection for the genre for a good family picture.
Even as an advertisement for canisterapia, this amateurish piece wouldn't pass.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from assholes like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, and here's how you fucking understand it, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want, the answer will always be no.
If you'd listened like that all the time, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in that case, a brigade for extra income.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"The almost complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israel Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only 6% of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain of this week was therefore rather an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas scene, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Precipitation in Israel comes almost exclusively during the winter months, it is bumpy and irregular.
The winter rains are dependent on forests.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fires.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water supplies and irrigation for farmers.
The largest freshwater source in Israel, the Sea of Galilee, filled to the brim this spring thanks to the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been falling.
The water industry warned of drought a long time ago.
“Depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall can be expected to fall here,” said Uri Schor, a spokesman for Israel’s Water Authority in 2018.
Israel can help itself with technologies such as desalination or wastewater recycling.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, there are more tankers.
Water pipes and private wells are drying out.
“My orders have increased by seventy to eighty percent this year compared to the previous two years,” Imad Sulejman, a tanker driver, said in September.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The river bed was completely without water.
The region has had the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military action against Iran
Israel’s defense minister said the talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, according to Jonathan Lis.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to convince the Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also informed Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are messing with them.”
About three years ago, this happened to me too.
I liked the lady a little bit and grilled her during the conversation to find out what she really wanted me to do.
In the end, I found out that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I gave the girl some more doubts and questions and finally thanked her and left.
You can tell me I'm a loser, but the pyramid is the pyramid and the financial advisors are the financial advisors.
Skiers went to the mountains at the weekend, there was plenty of snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major push of skiers this weekend.
After heavy snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no shortage of snow, and some ski resorts have started operations thanks to this.
The skiers were not discouraged by the obligation to prove themselves with a Covid certificate in lifts.
While lifters do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people went to cross-country trails and ski slopes in the Liberec region on the weekend.
The skiers wished the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are satisfied, that opening weekend really came out from that Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” praised Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the Sports Centre Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d.
Hundreds of people went to Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>ky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, the Ski Arena Karlov or the centre in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> na <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk<0xC3><0xA1> were opened.
The weekend attendance was very decent, with an estimated 400 people coming on Saturday and today.
The conditions are super.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so the perfect, not sparing praise from the representative of the ski resort in Brann<0xC3><0xA1> Rostislav Proch<0xC3><0xA1>zka.
Ski resort operators can only sell a ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are within the time limit after suffering from COVID-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready for this and prove themselves with the necessary documents, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK René Hrone<0xC5><0xA1> from the <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n ski center.
"We only recorded incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some ski equipment rental and retailers.
Fortunately, the interest in renting skis is there.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still plenty of customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Opava shop Skiopava.
Greater stress is expected in the period of ski courses.
David <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k, the manager of the Royal Hradec company Snowbear, also feels that the covid is not as interested in borrowing ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we were almost borrowed.
Compared to the pre-pandemic period, we are at about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>int<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to him, people have become lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, a large demand is recorded by the rental company in the Novako area on Bo<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Dar.
They started renting skis there a week ago and now they have to order them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the operator of the premises.
The interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and rich to not go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
Smart and smart people go abroad, who have no property here.
The owner of the company does not leave abroad.
But I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they simply will not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n winning one beautiful day, he ruled for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is elections.
If he's going to live a lousy life here, some traditional V4 lunatic could win here, too.
The young and the educated will leave, will remain his supporters and people whose property cannot be put on the plane.
Awesome photo!
Langmaier in blood for a beer bet?
While autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the staff of the film Island headed by Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for shooting?
London police are still searching for the missing Czech.
She was last seen on the way home.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” said Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnco worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday, November 28 at 7:45 p.m. and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncov<0xC3><0xA1>, according to British media, worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Member of Parliament Harriet Harman, who raised the issue of Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> at a press conference on Saturday, also called on the public to cooperate.
“She has been missing for several days, she is only 32 years old, she is from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death,” she said, holding a photograph of a woman distributed by the London police.
“I feel we all have a special responsibility to try to find her because she was away from her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
This is not how I underestimate Ukraine.
These are not "huge numbers", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of the invasion and it is starting to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know why you think Russia wants war.
War is a hell of a lot of fun, and Russia has Italy’s GDP.
The comparison with the situation in 38 is out in so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can already compare it with the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it was not going to comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia would annex those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the border would be like.
The pacta sunt servanda...
New timetables are in force in Prague from Sunday, they will mainly affect suburban connections
Passengers in Prague's Integrated Transport (PID) have been waiting for several changes since Sunday, especially regarding suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed their route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav is newly integrated into the integrated system.
In the capital, from Sunday, the high-speed trains from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice stop at the Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station.
S7 trains will take off in the suburban train transport, which pass through the Prague Central Station on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod.
In the recently opened station Praha-Zarhradn<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC4><0x9B>sto will stop the R17 express train from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Among other things, buses will go to Svetl<0xC3><0xA1> nad S<0xC3><0xA1>zavou, Blatna near Jesenice, Staré Splav<0xC5><0xAF> and Turnov.
Buses will be included in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav region, including lines with overpasses to the Liberec and Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradec regions.
During the integration, 77 lines will be abolished, 37 new lines will be introduced and the operation will be adjusted to 12 operating lines.
From Prague Zli<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>n, there will be a new bus line 405, which will go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atec.
A new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice u Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k has also been established, replacing the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be reinforced in the morning and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Rakovn<0xC3><0xAD>k, when the new express line 404 will be launched.
Lines 400 and 410 that go to the Liberec Region are now included in the PID system.
They leave from St<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not from N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice station.
The backbone line 400 goes through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k, Duba and <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> L<0xC3><0xAD>pa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 goes through M<0xC4><0x9B>ln<0xC3><0xAD>k and Dubou to Doks, Mimo<0xC5><0x88> and Jablonné in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d<0xC3><0xAD>.
On the contrary, traffic on dozens of Central Bohemian local lines, including to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mit<0xC3><0xA1>l pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>nem, has been cancelled or limited.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne.
Changes are expected in other places as well.
Buses replace some of the cancelled railway lines or the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xA1> is expanding with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets up to Milevsk.
The routes of the lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of Central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice in the Pilsen Region have been modified.
Healthy snack/lunch in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do classic 9-5 with a 30-minute break and my only way to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I do not have any movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy a pizza steak and yogurt and an apple for a snack.
Question: what healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
These are not the trees you need to see.
Only the tip of the tree can hide under the snow.
If damaged, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confessions of a Gift for a Relationship with the Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d: I wasn’t looking forward to this at all
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has been nothing but a revelation of the relationship between Dara Rollins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d.
They've been together for the summer, the famous football player even got divorced for the sake of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to her fans explaining why she has been hiding love from them for six months.
“Let me say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have missed that Dara caught a bear, that is, sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are used to the public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
What we were both not looking forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, continues the singer.
I just don't know who's worse off.
Whether it’s those who don’t care at all, and it pops up on them and from the can, or we, whose lives they scrutinize in detail.
As if one of you wanted to hear an opinion on whether you fit well with your husband or girlfriend, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
It's a sledgehammer, that's what you want, Daria's got a problem.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins went to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d has been the vice president of Juventus football club for a long time.
The truth was out now because they were waiting for Nedved's divorce to be finalized.
He and his wife Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not married on paper for only three weeks.
Anyway, to those who rejoice with us and wish us that, thank you.
We too are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him, I stand by him, for good and for evil, Rolins concluded.
Hello, the other commentators have probably already said all the essentials, I just confirm that the colleges are great to start with, my classmates mostly met and became friends during the first semester or two and then found a sublet together, which seems to me like the best option, because you know who you will live with.
Apartments usually don’t advertise too long in advance, so you probably won’t find much right now, but looking at the offer certainly won’t hurt.
Otherwise, you will definitely avoid not only Cejla, but also the surrounding area (streets like Vranovska, French, etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of <0xC5><0xBD>idenice are a bit of a ghetto.
By contrast, the district of Veve<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> is very student-friendly, the King’s Field and in that direction it’s nice, besides it’s close to most faculties of the VUT (I don’t know exactly where you’re going).
I’ve never been looking for a rental, but I’m a native Br<0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xA1>k, so maybe I can advise with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually quite okay that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it, or they go according to the state, and the state pays for it.
After all, we cannot allow a private actor to dominate a piece of education just because a few crowns will be given to a full-fledged state contribution and thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a statement loses some weight when it is written by a person who two days earlier expressed himself as follows about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So a vote against someone having an abortion is the same for you as a vote against a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced during cataloguing/digitalization that (and even long-time professionals) either throw it out of the eye, or write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and note that it is unreadable.
The truth is, in this case, it's pretty legible, so I probably wouldn't recommend it at all.
Personally, I would deal with it in some way in a note depending on what program you use.
If you want to be a proper and diligent student, you can look in some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or the printer just created his own character that fits with what's physically on the coin.
PS: Isn’t it more of an Odry Kingdom than an Odry Kingdom?
P.S. Someone has already told you this.
Take a look at this comment with <0xCE><0xA6><0xCE><0x99><0xCE><0x9B>H
Politicians have no idea what the "topic" of our Presidency will be.
That's a lot worse than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve something because no one could understand a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, some basic knowledge of English is not enough, this is a matter for lawyers.
There are hundreds of translators and interpreters working in various EU institutions; English is more suitable for politicians for informal contacts, for establishing above-standard relationships.
Moreover, with that English it is quite interesting, after the withdrawal of GB from the EU.
I don't understand the hate on Ceyle.
I've been working there for three years and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work at 10pm and never have a problem.
That this is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has hardly stepped in there in his life.
Yeah, probably most of the Romani population of Brno lives there, but the only thing they do is that they interfere on the sidewalk and park where they don’t :D It’s definitely not that I’m afraid to climb the street there in the evening.
So if you are looking for relatively cheap housing with good access to the center, I would go for it.
Many of the apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dada and Gelem's mistress as a stake in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit the first candle on the Advent wreath, but Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there's nothing to light.
I saw a wreath, and Lucie certainly has one too, said the saxophonist, who confirmed Patras' words so much that he often visits her.
He visits but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dada was left alone after his departure.
Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
Recently, we met with Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: Together again!
Felix Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemov<0xC3><0xA1>: Together again!
But we were still talking, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts on a regular basis and I will definitely buy something for Dada and Lucie, probably perfume.
I am a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to the christening of a music video clip at the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel myself.
I always find someone to have fun with, says Slov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet his wife Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Sobota Adriana or singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltov<0xC3><0xA1>.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt anyone will defend us for us, and our location is strategic enough that the aggressor would have to be a complete idiot not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few policemen and they cannot afford it, as firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of health-trained people at such a level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava only goes to the heads of previous governments, not the army, they have been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the landscape is not just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst drought in recent years.
Waters have declined in mountainous and sub-mountainous areas, according to scientists, and a smaller amount of precipitation is recorded even in places where there was no need for moisture.
Climate change is the cause of the drought in much of Central Europe.
But the impact is also enhanced by the way we manage the land.
What should we prepare for in the context of drought?
How can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, that's how it will be, I can barely stay in ice skates, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and that tactic (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a total hallucination.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so lose two goals even if you do not have to win the match at any cost is different than when it is compared.
But anyway, what I listen to the Czech commentators that write, what the referees do not notice, whether male or female hockey, it is all strange, but it is so with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho if it was the other way around it is the same as always, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than they won, it would probably be the classic "smells lost" vs "We won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5,766 people were hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days are in the Czech Republic at 100 000, 871 per 100 000 for the last week.
The number of infections in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been registered.
This is the lowest daily number since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10,016,896.
The number of daily deaths is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" wave of Omicron-induced disease, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to the British Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron-infected people are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to grow.
No one has died of omicron yet, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour boss Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson had apparently broken the law by holding a Christmas quiz at Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
One Johnson government minister defended that the quiz took place “virtually” through a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around computers in Downing Street.
In the UK, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers held numerous parties despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are furious that Johnson and his government were making fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of ITV UK: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won by an overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events unfolded.
Want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is due to hold an election in the spring that could end Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n's 12-year rule.
It will be an election of European significance.
How much do you expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won’t be free either, because that wasn’t even the last two elections under Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the boundaries of the constituencies to profit from it, and does other smaller or larger tricks.
So far, the last one is so that everyone can choose in practice wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from determined districts to those where the outcome is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they won't be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, it was not whether Fidesz would win, but how much and if he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that the united opposition will get more votes and mandates.
This is a big habit for Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power to play even harder?
Yes, we have some indications that they are ready to go beyond what they have done so far.
Recently, a recording of Fidesz leader L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> Kövér and parliament speaker L<0xC3><0xA1>szl<0xC3><0xB3> Kövér leaked to the independent media reveals that the opposition poses a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yes, that's one of the news.
It all starts with language.
I was beaten quite often, last time at 14, my mom's parents don't have much patience, I don't have much patience, my dad has a long time, but then he bangs extremely (just in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I was furious as a little girl, to the extent that I was lying on the ground in a spasm and was all blue, they took me under the shower about 2x to calm down.
Sometimes I was beaten up, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to solve things by force now, as a child I struggled quite a bit, now I hit myself on something for kicking at least and as a younger person I might have slapped my parents over the arm (so as not to get too much over the head), so I never have anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I'm not able to determine how explosive I am, but I'm sure the upbringing has something to do with it.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with my kids and deal with it the same way.
I think that beating children is just bad and that my parents should not have done it, especially not at the moment when it was no longer "educational," but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just fucks something up, maybe it is not possible not to screw up their children at least a little, so I do not blame them.
It doesn’t bother me at all, I don’t understand why the OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws should be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call Kundami those who make the laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're afraid of an income outage?
Is it really possible to count on the fact that people want and buy the product, and you will have what to pay for the mortgage?
Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner's monstrous world.
Where will Slovakia move forward with the murders of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the trial of four defendants in the murder of J<0xC3><0xA1>n Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>rov<0xC3><0xA1> begins.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
It moved civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important will the process be for Slovakia?
Journalists can do a lot of this.
How is it possible that this petition had an order of magnitude greater media attention than the anti-petition of the deans of all medical faculties, which came out a day or two later?
No, they let themselves be fooled, and the company bounced off.
On Czech television, Covid died six months ago.
The next government is coming to an end and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage nowhere
The proposal of Minister Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek needs to be fundamentally reworked
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is over and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens in the selection and authorisation of deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The legislative council of the government suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of negotiations.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected municipalities associated in the Platform against the Depth Repository, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
The self-governments expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their capacities in decision-making on the repository, which has been promised to mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech atomic law and the European directive.
We expect that the new government, in accordance with its coalition agreement, will rework the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
In particular, the proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the selection of the location for the repository is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can be really effective only if the municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given locality at all.
This can be ensured by imposing an obligation on the Repository Administration to seek the consent of the municipalities concerned before starting a specific procedure.
The proposed proposal almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in permitting procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensations for municipalities for the entire process of finding and selecting a location for storage, its authorization and operation.
According to today’s legal standards, the representatives of municipalities do not have much opportunity to defend the interests of their citizens in the search for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision is taken by the Office or the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
Any action shall not have a suspensive effect on the conduct of exploration or construction works.
The co-decision of self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries and certainly in those where they have already advanced in permitting repositories, as in Sweden or Finland.
In addition, the preparation of the law is another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices for the preparation of legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and following up on the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zem<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
According to the register of contracts, the total amount for these works should amount to almost 4 million crowns.
Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hr<0xC3><0xA1>dek and spokesman of the Platform against Deep Repository, said: After the ministers of industry, who were only pushing away the position of the self-government towards the state authorities in search of a deep repository of highly radioactive waste, we expect a more significant turnaround from the new government.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of the lack of rights of municipalities in such a fundamental building in the same way as the directly affected municipalities in selected localities.
The Anti-Deep Depot Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to push for a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep depots.
The platform further advocates that the decision on the selection of the location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
The actor John Goodman (69) made to lose weight fear: He lost 90 kg.
Although he did not need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by the doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose weight, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
His new character was featured in the Los Angeles premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat guy from the Roseanne sitcom is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight, because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put everything in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Moving, exercising.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still anymore,” Goodman told ABC.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss".
If this is a text on a platform that expects readers from the game environment, I would not translate it at all.
If it was a formal text or a university text, I would probably be looking for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are many different types of bosses.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses, yes, and so there is a "boss" something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is a final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss), who are not at all needed to beat in order for the game or level to be completed, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player is not directly involved with them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called anything?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss in a single word, Czech and other languages do not solve it (interesting is only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is simply for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The missing Peter from London is searching for the whole world.
The Czech police are also involved.
British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srncov since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Hungary since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Petra Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> was last seen by her colleagues on 28 November.
British police have been searching for her since December 3.
Interpol has issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
Peter is searching the world.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
"We share information about the case," she added.
The search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, she is thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her.
Harriet Harman, a member of Parliament, was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in posting leaflets with Petra's face.
"We are very worried about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It is not clear who he was or what he had in common with Peter.
Pre-Christmas Czech terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While data in October indicated a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month, with the end of the year approaching, the attacks intensified significantly.
We recorded a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18.
The attacks are aimed at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same.
An infected attachment in an email is intended to draw the user’s attention to a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
While last month’s dangerous attachment had the word invoice in its title, this time it was marked as a copy of the receipt correction for 11,2021...exe,” said Martin Jirkal from Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan Internet browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login information, which is then sent to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the formbook spyware remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists in November captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook weakened slightly in November, but still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks took place continuously throughout the month, with increased activity on 3, 10 and 15 November.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was called REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
But the name of the receipt still appears.
An attachment in English can then be much more dangerous for the English user.
A significant decline and suppression of activity is recorded by security analysts at the Fareit program, which was responsible for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in the last few months.
That today's smart-ass demo that doesn't need oxygen, because oxygen is for vaccinated idiots.
The march through Prague was bigger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and in my experience as a protester, I am not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the procession filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of bystanders are spontaneously added to the procession of about 4,000 demonstrators.
Something new is being born here, says Radek Mokr<0xC3><0xBD>.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led to a common speech.
Only the anti-vaxers themselves, the anti-wrestlers and co. would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The events of the association Chc<0xC3><0xAD>pl dos have an upward popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy on the inside.
Sometimes I get the impression that they rent the same stage and technique.
It’s hard to say what kind of movement could be bribed from this dissatisfaction, it depends not only on the flow of money, but also on whether Pfizer’s three-dose vaccine will not become a quarter or more of a dose.
It's definitely not a left-wing movement or a center-left movement, you bet it is.
The three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, as it is obvious that we will have to be revaccinated every six months.
I'm very glad the vaccines saved us.
The brilliant action of scientists, to which humanity is rightly proud.
The end of the footsteps, Bulgaria has a new prime minister proclaiming change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue the change that won the November elections.
It has already managed to form a government of a broad coalition, which should take office in a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the previous government, under the weight of anti-corruption protests, lost the elections.
However, the victorious parties that advocated the fight against bribery and abuse of power could not agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the "secret" shots it is a global hit.
Over the weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech, who has been wanted by London police for several days.
Petra Srncov<0xC3><0xA1> was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the information about the employee of the children's hospital, the police are also calling her current employer or MP representing the part of London where she lived.
“Petra’s disappearance is not at all like her behavior and we are starting to worry about her,” said Lucy O’Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnco worked.
"Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is," she continued.
According to her, the missing Czech Republic left work on Sunday, November 28 at 7:45 p.m. and headed home to Camberwell.
She was last seen on a bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her co-workers.
Srncov<0xC3><0xA1>, according to British media, worked as a "nurse assistant" at Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is missing,” a group of health facilities said in a tweet.
“We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that might help find her to contact the police,” the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Kocourkov<0xC3><0xA1> (and also the district pirate councillor) told the <0xC5><0xA0>umper amateur painter of children’s rooms that she was infringing copyright with her paintings.
However, the court recognized that the paintings of Mole in the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk chambers did not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, the moon was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a hatch.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred complaints to the <0xC5><0x98>SD, to which the road belongs, and because it did not respond, the hole continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the <0xC5><0x98>SD began to "intensely address the situation".
