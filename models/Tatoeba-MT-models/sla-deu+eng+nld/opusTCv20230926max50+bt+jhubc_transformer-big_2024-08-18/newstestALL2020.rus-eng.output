China strongly opposes U.S. adoption of “Taipei bill”
China strongly opposes the adoption by the United States of the so-called “Taipei Bill”, which seriously violates the principle of one China and the principles of three Sino-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the Office of the State Council of the PRC for Taiwan Ma Xiaoguang.
The approval of the bill by the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is also a serious violation of international law and fundamental principles of international relations and a gross interference in China’s internal affairs.
According to him, Taiwan is part of China, and related issues are related to China's internal affairs.
“We call on the American side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue in order to avoid further damage to Sino-American relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he said.
China must and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone and no forces, stressed Ma Xiaoguang.
TikTok hides from users unwanted videos
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old.
Imagine China / Reuters
Chinese social network TikTok is censoring videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet’s independence, or the banned Falun Gong religious group, The Guardian reports.
The documents, which appeared in the publication, say that the owner of TikTok (the company ByteDance) with the help of the application promotes the goals of China's foreign policy abroad.
Most of the violations related to China’s policies fall under “incitement of hatred”.
In each case, TikTok places unsolicited posts in a context appropriate to the general rules, so that the actions of the social network do not look censored.
For example, the ban on criticism of China’s socialist system falls under the general ban on “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc.”
The ban on mentioning Tiananmen Square incidents or the genocide in Cambodia falls under the “distortion of the history of China or other countries.”
The document also lists the banned names of 20 "foreign leaders or statesmen" including North Korean leaders Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, U.S. President Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and South Korean presidents.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
Posts from the first category are deleted by the administrators of the social network and may lead to the blocking of the user.
Not too severe violations belong to the second category: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited to TikTok algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules are outdated and no longer applicable: “We are now using a localized approach for moderation, as well as engaging independent local professionals.”
Russian users of TikTok have no specific restrictions on publication, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Production Center.
"Production Center" is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All promotional materials of bloggers "Production Center" agrees with representatives of the social network, but user materials can be posted without consent, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if TikTok could speak about politics or Putin, Bogdanov answered affirmatively and said he had seen such publications.
With Bogdanov agrees the founder of the agency Our Didgital Roman Zaripov: "The basic rules for users TikTok lists in the user agreement: it is impossible to post shocking content, discriminatory statements and so on."
But under these rules, you can bring any content that the moderators do not like, says Zaripov.
Zaripova Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of its users in the world exceeds 500 million, 40% of which are under 18 years old.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
Social network administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the neural network analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, his account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019 ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of WeWork coworking.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from scammers that replace the phone number of the bank has increased.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator handed over to telecom operators information about more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial organizations were called.
In 189 cases, operators found a change of number.
Another 218 rooms were blocked, and in 59 cases, they set a restriction on the use of financial services.
Deputy head of the department of information security of the Central Bank Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced the replacement of the number.
He explained that operators do not always respond to the Central Bank’s warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the absence of such an obligation in the Law on Communications.
In the Bank "Opening", Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the information about the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a change of number.
As reported in the press service of “Beeline”, part of the information about fraudulent calls, which was transmitted by the Central Bank, was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are really used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would lead to disruption of the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of numbers of fraudsters, which the telecom operator will contact with each call to check the number.
He explained that the establishment of such a base would require amendments to the legislation.

Barcelona blackmails Neymar
Spanish FC Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker's move to Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost reached the court, but the Catalans offered the player to resolve the dispute without the intervention of Themis.
Otherwise, they refuse to return.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also a Brazilian agent, set an interesting focus: under an agreement with Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, which the player signed in 2016, he was supposed to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was in PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Moreover, the lawyers of the Brazilian insist that the club also owes him interest for late payment.
When Neymar’s claims became known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
Blue garnets insist that the bonus was relied on to fulfill the entire contract - from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was entitled to only a quarter of 40 million euros and require the return of a proportionate part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and "Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a" almost agreed on the return of the "prodigal" player in the bosom of Catalonia.
True, the deal broke down, but the hope for the return of the forward remains.
And now, according to Sports.Ru with reference to the insiders, the lawyers of the club told the representatives of the player that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in pre-trial order, it will exclude the possibility of the return of the Brazilian.
Neymar himself wants to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.

Man with samurai sword tried to defend the cart found in the garbage can
A resident of the American city of Oakland Park, Florida, was arrested on charges of attempted murder after waving a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a cart found in the garbage.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging in a garbage dump near a vacant house.
This was noticed by the evening walker Todd Beavers (Todd Beavers).
The latter decided to join the search and found a black cart among the rubbish.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He believed that he could claim a cart, since he was the first to dig in the garbage.
The men began to argue.
Suddenly Beavers grabbed the cart and ran with it towards his home.
Then Miller took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught Beavers near his house.
Miller pulled the sword from the knife and began to wave it towards the truck hijacker.
Beavers told Miller that the incident was being recorded on video.
When Miller noticed the video camera, he ran away, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and walked into the house.
Shortly thereafter, he saw an unfamiliar woman enter his yard and pick up the cart, shouting insults.
The police are already looking for Miller for driving a car without a license.
The man was arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that in the American city of Hardiston, New Jersey, the hedge fund manager attacked an unfamiliar woman and wounded her with a sword.
Thus, he reacted to the fact that the guests at the wedding, which was celebrated in the same hotel where he stayed, did not allow him to smoke.
Mass riots for three
The “Moscow case” against the participants of the summer protest actions the further, the more markedly it disintegrates into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of the “mass riots” itself cannot stand the test, but in the absence of a political decision to bring this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the dismissal of the charges.
The collapse of the case should inspire the society, but it will certainly leave in extreme irritation the security forces, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence were in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants in the case under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minyaylo was suddenly released from custody without any obligations, and a few hours later and fully rehabilitated: the SCR removed the charges from him.
Minyailo was under arrest for almost two months, he was supported by several professional communities: historians, priests, writers.
After that, only two defendants remained in the case for involvement in the riots (there were 13 initially): Sergei Fomin, transferred to house arrest on 3 September, and Samaridin Rajabov, who had been arrested by the court until the end of December (he is also accused of violence against a representative of the authorities, Art. 318 of the Criminal Code).
The court sentenced the author of a funny petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States
The court of the Vidzeme suburb of Riga has punished the author of a humorous petition on the accession of Latvia to the United States of America Denis Bartecki.
It is noted that the man was assigned 80 hours of correctional work and one year of probation.
“Common sense is not the strongest side of our system,” Bartecki commented on the court’s decision.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia’s accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia’s accession to the Galactic Empire and the country’s exit from the solar system and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was opened against Bartecki under the first paragraph of the 82nd article of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public appeal to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Previously, in 2016, the author of an online petition on Latvia’s accession to Russia received six months in prison.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia has prepared amendments to the law "On the police" in order to protect law enforcement officers from the dissemination of defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, on the federal portal of normative legal acts, an application for public discussion of the bill appeared, the draft document itself has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honour and dignity of a police officer from “the dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including information of a discrediting nature”.
How police officers are supposed to be protected from defamation on the network is not specified.
At the same time, the explanation to the document notes that the provisions of the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already envisaged by the law on the blocking of posts insulting government representatives and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws came into force in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussions and independent anti-corruption expertise.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law "On the police" should enter into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing “clear disrespect of the state” on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it a day to eliminate it.
For the first violation of prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for repeated violation - administrative arrest for up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl edition of 76.ru.
Shortly after that, the Chudov district court of the Novgorod region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting on the network “two records with information in an indecent form that offends human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation.”

Will phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help prolong youth?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly studied.
One of the most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are studied well and have a positive effect on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age (among them cardiovascular, some cancers).
Known sources of phytoestrogens - all legumes (the most popular - soybeans), hops, flax seeds.
However, many experts believe that such dietary supplements can not be a complete replacement for natural hormones.
It is impossible to exclude the possible harm from such additives.
For example, against the background of their reception, the production of their own hormones may decrease due to the fact that too many analogues from the outside enter the body.
Veretennikov called for the revival of the Kazakh "Genis".
The former striker of "Rotor" and the national team of Russia Oleg Veretennikov joined the action on the revival of the Kazakh "Genis".
The club from Astana, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Genis", was disbanded in 2014.
Veretennikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I learned about the action on the revival of the football club "Genis", organized by his fans.
And I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
These were not the best times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
I will always remember Munaitpasov Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career!
"Genius" must be reborn!
He has a great story and great fans.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their native club!” – wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.
The complex "Bastion" launched on Chukotka rocket "Onyx"
For the first time, the Defense Ministry launched a cruise missile from the Bastion complex in Chukotka.
Onyx launched at a distance of 350 kilometers from the target, and 200 of them flew over land, which is a record for this type of missile.

Hydrometeorological Center called the true folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk customs, according to which people try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The Hydrometeorological Center checked all the signs that supposedly work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can really be trusted, however, in a short period of time.
As the scientific head of the Hydrometeorological Center of Russia Roman Wilfand said, if the sun is red during sunset, then the next day will be really nice, as our ancestors noted.
If the sky is white, it will rain the next day.
The second working feature is based on bird watching.
It is often said about swallows, if they fly low, then it is usually raining.
This is simply explained - when the humidity is high, the mosquitoes get their wings wet and the feathers are forced to descend to hunt insects, writes TASS.
On different continents there are folk signs.
Sourcing Day is a traditional national holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day it is necessary to observe the sulphur climbing out of its hole to determine the time of the arrival of spring.
Unidentified oil spills found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spills of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The pollution centers were scattered over two thousand kilometers of the coastline.
Reports of the first detected oil spills began to arrive on September 2.
However, every day until Thursday, their number, as well as territorial coverage, continued to increase.
The Brazilian Institute of the Environment conducted a chemical analysis of the identified samples.
It turned out that they are all identical and we are talking about crude oil.
State oil corporation Petrobras, to which the samples were transferred for analysis, said that their composition does not correspond to oil extracted from fields in Brazil.
“It’s thick oil.
It can be dropped from one of the ships after cleaning the tanks.
Many continue to do so.
And most likely, it got into the ocean current,” said the coordinator of the trade union of oil workers of the states of Pernambuco and Paraiba Rogerio Almeida.
He also added that, despite the prohibition of this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected states in the north-east of the country, environmentalists found nine sea turtles completely covered with oil film.
Only two of them were rescued.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Institute of the Environment, together with Petrobras, will begin to clean the contaminated beaches.
Meanwhile, experts of the institute recommend tourists and locals to bypass the oil stains and notify about all the detected pollution centers.

Russians have nothing to postpone for retirement - V. Matvienko
The speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko believes that the Russians do not have enough savings to fully earn in the country the draft law on the guaranteed pension product.
The practice of increasing pensions at the expense of personal savings in the world is quite common.
It is another matter how timely its introduction to us.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has income, of which they simply have nothing to allocate for an increase in pensions in the future," Matvienko said.
The Russians, according to the speaker, can not understand the mechanisms of formation and accrual of pensions, because "the constant changes in this area have completely confused them."
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system that regulates its legislation.
“Russia is a social state, and we are obliged to do everything to ensure that the size of pensions, social protection of citizens is improved.
But steps in this direction should be thought out, responsible, taking into account domestic realities,” Matvienko told RIA Novosti.
The Head of the SF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on the guaranteed pension product) will develop, then several basic principles should be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the state for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
On September 6, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced the sending for approval of the draft law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are an exclusively voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, guaranteeing the safety of long-term pension savings of citizens by the state, registration of citizens' savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man remains in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have agreed.
Image caption The news of the departure of a beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many loyal fans
One of the most famous characters of the comics - Spider-Man - will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures have been able to agree on the rights to use it in the films of the franchise.
This was announced from a Sony press release, which says that the third part of “Spider-Man” with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not come to a consensus on the division of income, because of which "Spider-Man" will leave the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The film is owned by Sony.
She rented them out for the Marvel films, which belong to Disney.
As a result, Sony received revenues from revenues in movie theaters, and Disney - from souvenirs and toys.
As reported, at some point this situation ceased to suit Disney, and the company wanted to revise the agreement.
Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige said he was delighted.
It’s amazing that Spider-Man’s journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe will continue.
“We at Marvel Studios are all very excited to be able to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is an iconic figure.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world,” he said in a statement.
At the same time, Feige recalled that Sony is creating its own film universe, built just around Spider-Man.
“It happened that he was the only superpowered hero who found himself in different movie universes.
So while Sony continues to develop its own Speedy universe, the future can bring unexpected surprises.”
Tom Holland, who played Spider-Man in five films, apparently commenting on the news, posted in his Instagram account an excerpt from the film "The Wolf of Wall Street", in which the hero Leonardo DiCaprio shouts "I'm not leaving!"
Information about the contradictions between the companies appeared in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to receive half of the box office revenue from Spider-Man films, provided that both companies will pay half of the cost of producing paintings.
But that didn’t work for Sony.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has caused anger among many loyal fans.
Details of the new conditions have not yet been disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: “We’ve worked well together for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many [Spider-Man] fans.
We are happy to be able to move forward together.”
The film "Avengers: The Finale", uniting Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest-grossing in the history of world cinema, moving from the first place "Avatar".

The expert told why it is necessary to refuse tea in bags
A group of scientists from Canada, representing McGill University, found that when you brew a bag of tea in a cup in five minutes gets more than ten billion microplastic particles.
Particles of sawdust can also be added to the packaged drink, food safety expert Elizaveta Tikhonova told Nation News.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information about the composition of packaged tea - the manufacturer can add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The sawdust at the end of the season is not thrown away, so they may end up in tea.
"Moreover, tea plants are not always included in the bags," Tikhonova said.
According to her, it is better to abandon the use of such a drink in favor of tea for weight, which is sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea lies not only in the composition, but also in the method of its production - microparticles are heated to high temperatures, due to which they can begin to emit harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - in such a drink will be the least additives," - said the expert.

Regions are invited to share the secrets of business support
On September 27, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy Andrei Kutepov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with a proposal to express his position on the initiatives of the Federation entities on improving the legislation in the field of support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It is time to establish inter-regional relations.
The Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions about the programs of business development and legalization of the self-employed, as well as the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"To date, communication between the regions is not well established, as a result of which the business community in all regions of the visit by the senators indicated the lack of information about regional programs for the development of entrepreneurship in the country as a whole," Andrei Kutepov said.
In the annex to the letter sent to the Government, he presented a set of positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and aggregated data from the regions with proposals and issues (the editorial office is available).
In addition to the relevant ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step to such an exchange will be the transmission of information available to the Committee on Economic Policy,” the senator told Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, in many regions of the country, support programs for small and medium-sized businesses have been adopted and are successfully operating.
For example, in the Vologda region there is a Center for Entrepreneurship Support, which, in addition to financial support measures, helps businessmen in carrying out certification of finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a system of business support has been developed, providing for the implementation of the one-window principle through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar Territory, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are provided with grants from the regional budget.
In the Orel region there is a cluster development center.
The Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state co-working centers at the expense of the federal budget.
And in a number of other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-Employed People Continue to Get Out of the Shadow
According to the regional authorities, in order to more effectively support small and medium-sized businesses, a number of changes should be made to the current legislation.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term “self-employment” with “entrepreneurial activity”, since this “most corresponds to the content of the state service for promoting the self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanovo region, it is considered necessary to amend the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for finishing and repairing residential premises, suburban buildings, physical training classes.
The Bryansk region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions, they advocate for enshrining in the normative and legal field the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of support for social entrepreneurship.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific bills," Andrey Kutepov assured.

It is about the supply of goods that did not fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volumes of products banned for import were compensated by an increase in imports from the CIS countries, Africa, Southeast Asia, Serbia.
At the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the rules for the destruction of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs, which are prohibited from importing into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document, posted on the official portal of legal information, noted that the validity of the rules was extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the decree on the destruction of sanctions applied to products from the United States, the EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, since August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein have joined this list, and since January 1, 2016 - Ukraine.
The decree signed by Putin on the destruction of illegally imported “sanctions” (products that fell under the food embargo that Moscow imposed in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) came into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of “sanction” food in any legal way.
As Western sanctions continue, Russia has also extended its retaliatory measures.
At the same time, this measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing up to 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council under the President of the Russian Federation for the development of civil society and human rights Mikhail Fedotov earlier called the destruction of food “just immoral”, and this, according to him, negatively affects the education of people.
Moreover, Rospotrebnadzor took the initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for consumption in early June.
After that, a similar recommendation to the government was given by the Human Rights Council under the President of the Russian Federation.
And Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexey Gordeev said that it is wrong to destroy food products, and you need to think about how you can use them for their intended purpose, assessing the quality.

Chile to build <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion telescope
This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
According to ESO, this week officially began the construction of the dome of the building, which will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT) while the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomical project.
Its total cost is estimated by ESO to exceed one billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and construction of the building of the observatory.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking large mirror, whose diameter will be about 39 meters.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, as well as two auxiliary reflecting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 meters, will help E-ELT get the first detailed pictures of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and also look for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Despite the fact that the construction of the dome has just begun, mirrors, scientific instruments and other components of the observatory scientists, engineers and other specialists have been developing for three years - since the announcement of the first plans for the construction of the E-ELT.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
