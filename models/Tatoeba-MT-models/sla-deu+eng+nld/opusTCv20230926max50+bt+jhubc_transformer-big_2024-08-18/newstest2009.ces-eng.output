The Prague Stock Exchange fell into a negative at the end of trading
After a sharp fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected the losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares have reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange resumed its decline on Monday from the beginning of Tuesday, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the decline in stocks on Wall Street is behind the decline.
This is also how the market reacts to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the plan of stabilization of the local financial sector.
Falling Stocks in Asia
The Asian stock market experienced a dramatic decline on Tuesday, although the indices eventually wiped out some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng stock exchange in Hong Kong wrote off almost four percent during trading, but later deleted some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8%, while the markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually fell to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent according to the index.
“The timing of the U.S. bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world,” said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. without dependence on the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, they say, other countries will also be affected.
The Bloodbath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was to spend up to $700 billion (nearly CZK 12 trillion).
Legislators have thus ignored President George W. Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by almost seven percent and last saw a similar decline in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not pass in the House, the index found itself in a free fall.
Congress backs down: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
U.S. Congressional leaders and President George W. Bush’s government have agreed on a broader financial aid deal for the U.S. financial system.
Voting on it will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial aid to the U.S. financial system worth $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it has not yet been won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final form of the law and vote on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
According to sources, the plan could be voted on in the Senate first Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
Then, however, there will be "sobering up" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets achieve in practice.
Paulson: Plan needs to be effective
“We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences of opinion on what the market stabilisation package should look like,” Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, told Bloomberg.
According to him, the final vote could take place on Sunday.
On Sunday, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give a definitive look to the government fund.
He should buy back unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
“We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We need to continue the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trading
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress on Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where Congress’ decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the bill, or whether the last-minute negotiations could tie in with a problem.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law still makes a number of changes.
The total amount earmarked for aid to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be made available as soon as possible, as President George W. Bush has demanded.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function, in a succession of another $100 billion and later the final $350 billion.
Bush Appreciates Progress in Negotiations
The president can veto the decision, but Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has collapsed because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
“We worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
U.S. President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was satisfied with Saturday’s progress and praised “the two-way effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a senior negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed on accountability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing reliefs, and timing of funding for the plan.
The new law is also intended to limit the so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establish a committee to supervise the fund.
It should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We have worked very hard on this and made great progress towards a deal that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys, in order to reduce monthly repayment costs for debtors and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to chief economist Patrio Finance David Marko, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement it.
"This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problem assets will be redeemed.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share their losses,” Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not that important, according to Mark.
“It is much more important that this week’s congressmen agree that they support this plan and that they will consecrate it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement to be approved is the most important at the moment,” Marek said.
Knife Blade Fight: MP3 Players vs Mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
I think it’s better to just buy a phone.
However, there are plenty of reasons to buy a separate player.
The choice completely depends on the method of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It’s hard to get a top-of-the-line, expensive turntable at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if there are vinyls with art rock, jazz or blues in your shelves, you probably at least dream of such a turntable.
The same is true of music on the go, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a player, as well as a fan of Pink Floyd, it may be difficult to try the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide.
The battery life also depends.
Some high-end music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobiles do by no means.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to its primary functions, phone calls and texting, it can play music and video, record both, have a better, a worse camera, and maybe even navigate.
And if we take smartphones and communicators into account, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV can photograph anything.
The versatility of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your mobile, the sooner the indicator on the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
Therefore, for cheap mobile phones, count on the fact that you will not play for more than a few hours.
If you call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you will not have this problem, even the worst ones will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem arises when recording music to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to the memory card, but few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without any reduction.
With the exception of iPods, you don’t need any special software.
Just fill your device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players create their own music library, sorted by the artist’s name, album name, genre or user rating.
Some devices display only the directory tree structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, operating system smartphones).
Players are easier to use, mobiles can do more
When choosing a specific device, be especially interested in battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and, of course, comfort of operation.
If music is primarily a backdrop for you and if you listen to it every day for a short time, for example, on the tram, you need any phone that plays MP3.
This can be done by almost any mobile phone.
You don’t even have to watch too much what music formats your phone or player can do.
MP3s can handle everything, and the vast majority of music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most common and besides it, the vast majority of devices can also handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
It is enough to visit the relevant pages of the operator (or another provider) via mobile Internet and purchase a song or album.
This service could already be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is poor and is usually limited to fast-leathered radio hits.
Prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you can feel the phone in your pocket while the MP3 player lies forgotten at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the integrated speaker, which has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones will be the price for many.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than $3,000.
For three and four thousand crowns, you will already make a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the absence of output to ordinary headphones.
The best and technically most equipped phones even with a 3.5 mm jack for ordinary headphones cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can control really everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the control with a previously common tape recorder or perhaps a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneously turned on mobile Internet and subsequently a huge data transfer account.
What kind of device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the corresponding card, you will fit into two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive can cope with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not need to spend more than CZK 1,100.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners, you should rather reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokias and Samsungs).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is closer to a separate MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman phones have the same user interface as self-selling MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with more memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Possibly
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite advanced and our operators offer almost all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we are missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones cheaper.
Maybe he won't be missing for long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was confirmed by the CTU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding up so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, we have three mobile networks and penetration high over 100%.
On the other hand, mobile operators like to bet on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, Chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunication Office (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), has often said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that the classical operator with its own network probably does not have a lot of chances (after all, it would probably be difficult to search for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, to which even classical operators had to react.
However, even before the introduction of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile, similar voices were heard in the UK as in our country.
However, it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
After all, we do not have to go too far for examples.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
The financial group Penta, which owns U:Fona in the Czech Republic, is behind Mobilking.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to function effectively, they need much less customers than a conventional operator.
They do not carry relatively high costs for the construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost – they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, a bet on a new target group can be quite a good move.
This operator focuses specifically on men.
“The management guys are choosing Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could catch up with us.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated in terms of service offerings."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, say mobile operators
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokeswoman of the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The interest in launching a virtual mobile operator has not been hidden for a long time by the group GTS Novera, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunication services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, a spokesman for the group.
Maybe it's flashing for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator should wait until the end of the year.
For now, however, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any subject with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Press Department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in rare agreement with the O2 statement: “So far we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build further.”
He added: “It’s hard to have a virtual operator on T-Mobile by the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific deal on the table to be able to think in this short term.”
Vodafone is focusing its attention on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "By dealing with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most beneficial for our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with operators one hand
The actions of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a fall in prices and, therefore, to a fall in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators want something, they can pull by one rope, is also evidenced by the thrust around the creation of U:fona.
Probably the greatest pressure towards <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> went at the time of the creation of U:fona from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the CTU website.
Now, however, it is U:fon that is useful as an argument for why not allow a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said: “The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further enhanced by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
However, due to this approach of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
This is not just the position of the Czech Technical University, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the United Kingdom and other developed countries - does not have the power to intervene in competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
But he took a typical stance on the whole issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential applicants was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS in response to our question.
From the representatives of the operators, the statement formulated in this way will not be surprising.
It is more than reasonable for the Office to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses its position on the market.
Particularly when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "In a foreign country where virtual operators are usually active, we can see that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile phone services."
But apparently the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is not one of the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In fact, shocking in the whole case is the touching consonance of the three mobile operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
As well as the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations, it is certainly only a matter of chance and tough competition.
"The Office found no signs of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of a dominant position in the market is one of many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of relevant markets prepared by the Czech Technical University, according to which telecommunications are a single market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So in a certain segment it must necessarily be dominant.
Even if we do not allow this argument, it should be at least a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that the three mobile operators are acting remarkably similarly.
At the same time, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
In the telecommunications industry, the responsibility of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> is a fairly common trick that the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS gives away from the whole matter.
We have met him in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s competences in the field of competition in telecommunications failed to be enforced, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
The <0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives must know this more than well, but apparently their interests are elsewhere.
That's what happens when no one's looking
At the same time, the operation of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
They are companies issuing their own price lists of mobile telephone services, which are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Its own mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies usually reach only the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts towards the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators forbid such resale.
"If the cases you're talking about happen, it could be a breach of the contractual terms that we're dealing with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said in response to our question about the issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such activities will not be carried out to responsible people from mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned above, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators is opposed to such a procedure.
These companies have significant profits and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows for such speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as ordinary customers of mobile operators.
But that should be at least weird.
In addition, another question opens up for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It must be added that the CSO has quite strong powers to detect such activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no idea of such a thing and their business conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As the text has already fallen several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In almost all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments used by them were practically identical - too small, or too saturated market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In developed countries, however, it was in these moments that regulators intervened, defending not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they then achieved that the first virtual operator was created and more were packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are throwing the whole case like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than appropriate in these cases.
But let's not throw flint in the rye.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator is coming to us really soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling it expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood, solemnly presented new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home.
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral and instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the anthem are Otakar Jeremias and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had intentionally chosen singers with young representative voices who were prominent and popular for singing solo variants.
“From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they agreed,” he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where my home was first heard in 1834 on the boards of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl, accompanied by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it to theirs.
The first syllable of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the “new” hymn?
Prague public transport on Wednesday for the first time will also drive on a chip
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be recorded in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, tram and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can buy about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual coupon (which will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it recorded on their chip card in the information centers and workplaces of the Transport Company in the metro stations Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Railway Station, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobylisy, Paradise Garden, Ka<0xC4><0x8D>erov and Luka.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers used the service by the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the dispensing windows in the metro stations, where they still had to stand regularly in long queues for paper tickets.
They buy the coupon online and upload it to their Opencard card at one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have access to a desk with trained staff, which will help them with their online purchase and will also upload a purchased coupon to their card," Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project, said.
In addition to libraries, it will be possible to upload electronic coupons to Opencard also in self-service vending machines, which are mounted in several vestibules of the metro.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, they resemble ticket markers, and passengers may have already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are five in the city now, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," he added.
Coupon will check the place of the driver of the vending machine
The operation of the vending machines that will start working tomorrow is simple.
Just insert an Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will upload itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, which are used mainly by residents of Central Bohemian municipalities.
"In trains included in the Prague Integrated Transport, guides are equipped with card readers to determine the time and zone validity of coupons," explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal from the organization Ropid, which compiles timetables for Prague public transport.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register of the driver.
When you arrive, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but also to attach Opencard to the designated place on the side of the cash register.
In this way, the driver will check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If a passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing easier than to ask the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not use suburban buses and do not remember when their coupon expires can go back to self-service vending machines, where the coupons are loaded onto the card.
Here, information about the validity of their documents will appear on the display of the device.
Sudetenland calls for referendum on U.S.
In 1945, Sudeten Germans demanded the incorporation of <0xC5><0xA0>umava into the United States.
It comes from a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live, at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, allegedly, in 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned to the President of the United States.
This is evidenced, among other things, by a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov are asking the US president in a letter not to allow the return of the "<0xC5><0xA0>umava County" - taken by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” reads the letter, signed with the words: “The people to whom the fate of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava lies at heart.”
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national character - only hope of brutality, ruthlessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American President ask that he take over the protectorate over the <0xC5><0xA0>umava for present and eternal times.
“We cannot believe that, whatever the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would admit this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and refutes minorities and does nothing to contribute to the victory of the Allies,” the letter reads.
The reason the authors are unable to sign is allegedly due to the fear of vengeance of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president allegedly doubted the minds of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava county on whether its residents want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a little naive in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some historians it appropriately illustrates the expectations of the Sudeten Germans of that time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least to suspect that it would be their expulsion from the republic, few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some form of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
During the war, he was a Budweiser German, assigned to the navy in the Baltic.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would use Czech," Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to discourage the driver from dangerous behavior behind the wheel.
The $150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It should discourage the driver from speeding and alcohol at the wheel.
And remind them to fasten their belts before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mostly human stories that attack emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "do not think" is written in capital letters on the essay.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of inattention with his own life.
Spectators will be "frightened" by the spots until 2010.
The ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of victims of accidents are commonly seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
“The driver is subject to a sugar and whip system.
The sugar for them is that, for example, if they go red, they save time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says the traffic psychologist of Na Homolce hospital Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why there is a need for information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, according to the psychologist.
Already less effective are the boards, which warn the driver about the dangers.
"If a static warning board is installed, it will probably soon merge with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israel’s interim prime minister, Ehud Olmert, has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including Pre-Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published by the newspaper Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all of them at all," Olmert said.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give a similar percentage to the Palestinians [Israeli territory], because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers running over his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find a “special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical sites” that lies inside the Old Town.
“Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he stressed further.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, an indispensable condition for a peace deal with Syria.
But that would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria only on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up to get the Golans.
They will have to relinquish their current relationship with Iran; they will have to relinquish their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to relinquish the continued support they provide to the terrorism of Hamas, al-Qaeda and jihad in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know, it is not allowed to walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose whether stewards and passengers can move on the bus while driving.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is in violation of the law on road traffic,” said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week was probably caused by a truck driver crossing a bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she had two more seats reserved.
However, the bus can crash or brake abruptly, even when the steward delivers coffee or newspapers.
The role is played by whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical license.
If the bus is not approved, passengers must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have a place to stand; this was confirmed by the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"We discussed this with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
They later called it off and we came to the conclusion that passengers are allowed to go to the toilet while driving if they have their own seat,” he said.
The steward's law doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward - no legislation addresses that role.
However, no legislation prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term of the driver of the vehicle; it does not define his rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has a standing space in the type approval.
That's the end of it," he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses, where there are parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity buses with parking spaces with a higher speed limit, and long-distance buses without parking spaces with a maximum speed limit and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like in an airplane, says an expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not see a major problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"With smooth driving, there are not many dangers, the situation can be compared to service in airplanes.
Even here it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the stewardess can hit her head."
“If the bus brakes, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or tram.
The safety of stewards must be dealt with by carriers by internal regulations," he says and also thinks, from the point of view of the law, the issue is unresolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers the services of stewards as a single bus carrier.
He employs 200 of them.
Even after an accident, the director does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewardship profession is risky, I'm going to cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers can be provided to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save costs,” he said.
As an interest in safety, the absence of stewards in their cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexey Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardess, we've been against it since the beginning.
Sooner or later, it will end in some kind of fatal accident,” he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy
A young stewardess from Pilsen, who worked for the company for two years, was killed in an accident on a line link to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the bus without using a direction indicator and blocked the path of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp manoeuvre, but he hit the right front part.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses that two places reserved for steward's rest would be sold out.
"These places cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's ortel, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
Modification of the law?
Invisible
Clarification of the movement of stewards on board the bus could be brought by the regulation of the law, on which the 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for over a year.
"But it has not reached any concrete conclusion.
Buses do not solve much, rather a point system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of a mobile phone when driving," says expert Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, adding that the control of the safety of buses is within the competence of the police and the occupational safety authorities.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter of the Board of Directors of WestLB to the employees of this bank.
The merging of the units of this Düsseldorf monetary institution with the Frankfurt-based Deka-Bank will create a "central institution of the financial group of savings banks for trading on capital markets," we will read in a letter that came to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will introduce into this transaction a "competence set" ensuring long-term returns.
And in general, they say, such a connection can be a decisive impetus for further association in the sector of land banks.
Such texts arise when the board wants to prove its ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Commission, but also on the part of the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, whose message to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers of savings banks know about its investment funds, and WestLB, of whatever kind, has been discussed for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, said in a presentation at the end of August that the merger of his Mainzer Landstraße banking house with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, did not make sense.
However, the board of directors of Deka-Bank, backed by one half of the Landesbank and the other half of the savings bank association, instructed the board to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
It could be trading in the capital market or part of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, financiers note.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees one of the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in connection with the consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that Deka-Bank could be merged with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
At the end of the day, there was nothing of this trio.
Shortly after the plans for the merger became public, the Hessian government spoke out against the participation of Helaba Bank.
The other two banks did not merge.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, there have been repeated speculations about the merger of Deka-Bank with the country’s banks.
Recently, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Helaba, has spoken negatively about speculation about the merger of his finance house with others.
However, it seems that independently it matures the belief that convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Bavarian parliament, the connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could be the first to be drawn.
That's not good news for Helaba.
If the pressure for further mergers should increase, it gradually loses possible partners for such a merger.
In the south, she would play only the second violin, despite the fact that she is facing the financial crisis significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Union of Savings Banks and Girobanks Hessen-Thüringen, which has a 58% stake in Helaba, banned the connection with WestLB.
This would be considered at most by Nord LB.
Geostrategic considerations of this kind, however, are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how closely the business models of the various institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the decisive question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the country's banks, the German Union of Savings Banks and Girobanks has not yet answered.
Everything could also end with the distribution of WestLB, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter from the local board of directors also talks about the fact that it is trying to find a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual folders with Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
This is the first time for Elena, the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time, Elena will be there as his girlfriend, and so everything will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a thicker beard, and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest show how deep tones can give his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot next to the Puorta Nuova station, four buses with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30 this evening at 23.45.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, in one bus there are only Brazilians.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And out loud, Marco Guarda says, it's nothing for the Italians.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a lining made of imitation fur and glasses with wide silver rings, belongs to the three buses.
He has been with them for five years at the Oktoberfest, only this year he organizes three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the beer stands, at 22.30 departure back.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary costs, Marco says.
The trip costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 including a welcome toast with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly under the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide – Marco took a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, along the highway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus shuts up quickly, the passenger sleeps.
They're doing well, they'll still need their strength.
He stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where he takes another break and many other buses with an Italian license plate on Highway 8 just outside Munich.
When Marc’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half past seven in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has a final speech, explains the plan of the attack.
First, put on a yellow cap.
It bears the inscription "Oktoberfest" on the left, next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second, “When the door to the beer tent opens, run!” calls Marco into the morning air.
"Run!" Go and fill the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so as not to obstruct, and not all the yellow caps on the same bench, spread out over the space!"
Salt costs 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving decently.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight, at exactly half past eleven, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, the beer tent space.
On the way, one member of the group hangs yellow hats as signs on trees, signs and even on an election poster of a large Bavarian party.
It is necessary to prepare for retreat.
The weekend with Italy is known as the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
The exact number of visitors is not available; it is said that fifty thousand of those who set off on a journey through the Alps and burst into beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend came from Italy.
The Munich police force will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, while Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which maintains national statistics, in which the Italians before the British (about 60 interventions) and Austrians (about 80) with about 200 medical treatments occupy the first place.
Particularly popular among Italians is the tent Hofbräu.
Sleepless nights for creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück stressed that Germany’s banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and included in his statement the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from crisis development.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax index follows a financial house specializing in real estate financing Hypo Real Estate (HRE) to receive a loan of several billion from a consortium of German banks to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan will go up to 35 billion euros.
Interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually depleted.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report, refinanced long-term projects for which he borrowed money in the extremely short term, which is no longer possible due to distrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrank by 95% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.37 million and its share of equity declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
As compared to the previous year, ordinary income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero, income from the increased value of receivables and from certain securities, as well as from the abolition of reserves for credit trading, fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
It was only thanks to higher revenues from the compensation for subsequent clearing costs in the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and for the mediation of trade for the group companies that the 16 % decrease in revenues was still moderate.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier burned down on mortgages for businessmen, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
Since too little money was made in traditional state funding, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary Hypo Real Estate now has to write something off, and these depreciations will have a "essential material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have let themselves be vaguely heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It was reduced by two-thirds in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depf.
More strongly than other institutes, it depends on refinancing on the interbank market, because it does not have any customer deposits.
After the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the source of interbank loans practically dried up, as banks guard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for a part of Depf’s loan portfolio – around 50 billion euros per year.
According to a statement by Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs are covered by this loan for the foreseeable future and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently largely incapacitated.”
Other sources have made it clear that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that Hypo Real Estate Group will not have to use the money markets in the near future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Supervision (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group on the market is now ensured.
This is what the bank’s shareholders and creditors hope for.
But given the dynamics and inaccessibility of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely possible that the loan would not need to be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank appeared to be facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue, though preliminary, cannot calm the passions.
The stock price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, the bond rates were well kept.
While preferential debts have practically not moved, secondary bond rates are losing significantly.
This mainly concerns the bonds of the former Württemberg Hypo subsidiary and logically the bonds with a maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability should be understood after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Depf, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issue banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect the securities to be paid in due time.
But there can also be things that almost no one dares to hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalization, the probability bordering on certainty has now become mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to prepare long-term creditors for a series of waking nights in which they will decide whether to give up their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the cap at least to create a transfer of losses from previous financial years to the exchange rate yields of later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltropov<0xC3><0xA1> introduces herself on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the German woman is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from mang. On her new blog about exchange stay she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already on my way to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take a 40-minute train ride to Tachibana High School.
I had to find the way myself, fortunately I did not get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students start meeting after 8 a.m. and twenty minutes before 9 a.m. begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I’m not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I hadn’t worn a school uniform yet, I wore my host mother’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue tights and black leather shoes.
So, dressed like this, I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nara Wo <0xC4><0x8D>e<0xC5><0xA1> Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and in a week I have a birthday.
At the time, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were chattering, giggling and waving, and I still heard the word "kawaii."
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly swam into my place.
The girl next to me smiled wide enough, considered it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite calm, but when the gong sounded, they literally filled me up.
They spoke one over the other and chuckled and asked me what was possible and what was impossible - and yet it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
After the break, everyone unpacked their benths.
My host mom also made me a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit and some fish in tofu dough.
I have no idea what I eat here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything's really good.
Well, except for the salty plums, br!
Benthas in Japanese schools aren't just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically modified, and hopes to get to know the boy better during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here, too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
And then I always said,
'Because it just fascinates me.'
I’ve been reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started learning Japanese once a little bit.
I knew I would have to come here someday.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings.
But how could we verify that they feel the same way when they behave like us?
In the online magazine "Edge" for several years published the contributions of well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it when we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we begin to engage in a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter into an inconceivable terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it will do what many other animals do: pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is because circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share in short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least for those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity might lie in the language nature of man: because so much of his perception is related to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter to language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something intrinsic and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, it puts us before great problems.
Most of my conclusions relate to the content of conscious experience, but in addition there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But this approach, which was taken by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses more on neural correlates of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but perhaps they are not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nonfrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a system of fear, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of a defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) exploits operational memory.
Seen from this angle, the sensations are closely related to those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially people.
In connection with the linguistic nature, a subtle degree of perception arises, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in areas of the cortex and brain stem dedicated to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could safely participate in the feelings perceived by multiple animal families.
Theoretically, I can’t deny it, but I think it’s unproven.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms in the same way: But how can it be verified, Pankseep further says, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the similarity of experience.
It is true that neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, on the other hand, cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it was possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I study emotional behavior rather than the emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
As with rats, I do not examine language and consciousness, nor do I examine feelings, for I do not know whether they exist.
It may be considered short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that the preparations will soon be managed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of its confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize the European Championship together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot to do in both countries.”
In the early implementation of the timetable for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts linger.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the European Championships will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible,” said Grigory Surkis, president of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish PZPN Union was recalled after numerous scandals by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by an independent administrator, Robert Zawlocki.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"We have assured UEFA President Michel Platini in a letter that this step will not suffer preparations for the 2012 European Championships."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced descent only last season due to manipulations, eventually even having to quickly move the start of the league.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid Strikes Back
She wanted to advertise for a new film, spoke in a private interview — and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex Dennis Quaid as a marital wrecker.
He's furious and he's hitting back.
Delayed Rose War with former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after the divorce, the two Hollywood actors have a nasty fight together - in front of the public.
In an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week, Meg Ryan first commented on the reasons for the collapse of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and that has been very painful."
The extent of the fraud was not known until after the divorce.
The stimulus for this mental striptease was Ryan’s PR work for her new film, “The Women,” which tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his portrayal of him as an unfaithful husband was striking: He is “crazy,” said the 45-year-old actor to the New York Daily News, “Meg repeatedly chews on the history of our relationship and adjusts it.”
In addition, it is "regrettable" that the 16-year-old son, Jack, once again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since her divorce, Quaid is remarried and has recently become the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on bending as follows: “My life goes on anyway.
I am very happy to have a wonderful family that is doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were up to 50% cheaper, according to one recent study.
Flights and accommodation in hotels have become cheaper again - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, after price increases in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed rose by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The most noticeable trend was in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is the weak exchange rate of the dollar, which caused "the declining appetite of American tourists to travel".
The fall in hotel prices also affected financial centres more than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent and even set a European record.
Ticket prices also showed a further upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the kerosene price increase, passengers in the Economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, while fuel-intensive long-haul flights even increased by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, prices for Economy-class tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the changes in Business and First-Class were less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, they grew by 11.9 percent, while in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 percent.
On German domestic flights, according to the cited study, prices fell by even half.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profitable airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
Thanks to a single goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the front of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to build a functioning Eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge Failed landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got into the game late and failed with a sticky balloon.
His report was precisely worded and sounded convincingly from his mouth.
He just knew he was right.
'We need a second goal, 'said Hermann Rieger in the corridor to the cabins of the Hamburg arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over, and most people sat back in their seats.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Cornelius Jol, the coach's assistant, raised his thumb as a sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order was probably similar: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"It wasn't looking good here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) Hamburgers owe the head of Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11) and the circumstances that very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>an could not hurt weak Hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
This Monday, Hamburger SV celebrates 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, viewers celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a lively updated table on the video wall, in which their team was listed as a premium.
It's going to be a birthday without a big party.
'We know how to evaluate it, 'said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the continuous table result symbolizes the league's uncalculability rather than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly located, but not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to fall by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow added something.
Around 8.30 p.m., the world’s most important stock exchange barometer showed a 5% drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs has lost almost 10% of its shares.
A few days ago, Warren Buffett had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds should be made available for the purchase of so-called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount should not be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive stock options lists of financial companies, which could be reimbursed if the exchange rate is favourable, thus reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
The billion-dollar bailout to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not rid investors of doubts.
The stock exchange of Hypo Real Estate, a major German bank, is strongly downward and pulls the Dax index with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank plunged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
The shares of the Munich-based real estate financier lost up to three-quarters of its value despite a bailout by the federal government and private banks, while Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important limit of 6,000 points and with a minus 3.7 percent recorded 5,839 points.
Stock markets all over the world have fallen to their knees.
In New York, the Wall Street trading day began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent during the first hour of trading, reaching 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on the bailout plan, with the Senate expected to vote on Oct. 1.
Other European exchanges were moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei leading index fell 1.26 percent after initial gains to 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, and trading ended at 12,595.75.
In MDAx, after the announcement of the increase in the basic assets of the stock Arcandor lost.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the business and tourism group announced that it would not sell shares in Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For nearly 18 years, the Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, now threaten to kill her in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot.
A gravitational slingshot is an aerial maneuver of space probes in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a space object, such as the Earth.
Thanks to this, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Cassini-Huygens European-American research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what the scientist has been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying bodies do not behave 100% as one would expect, according to the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
He was baptised with a gravitational sling anomaly.
Several experts fear that even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton continues to believe that Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the anomaly of the gravitational slingshot using the so-called dark matter, whose presence in the universe was discovered by astronomers.
"The dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth," he wrote.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space researchers for about a decade.
It is based on the apparent gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, a good fifth of the total mass of the universe is from this dark matter.
In Egypt, kidnapped tourists are at large.
After 10 days in the hands of their captors, according to the Italian Foreign Minister, the kidnapped tourists are back at large.
The kidnappers from Sudan demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in a gunfight before their release.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom talks are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly been targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists entering the Sahara seem to be free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabiya Arabic TV and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports of the Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are now checking their health," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition into the desert are apparently already on their way to Cairo.
The background of the hostage shootout remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping even before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom," the employee said.
He said "it was just a matter of taking the hostages," when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot and killed six hijackers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and captured two of them.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be given to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German intermediaries, said the release of the hostages was being delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the hijackers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by stepfather "leads to suicide"
Several years of abuse by the stepfather led the woman to kill herself, the court heard.
After confessing to eight cases of sexual harassment, 75-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that his half-daughter Stephanie Randle was regularly tied up when she was between five and seven years old.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in a confession.
The court also said Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007 at the age of 34.
When she was a child in Coventry, Trerise tied her up and blindfolded her, then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court heard that Ms. Randle, who had spent much of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse that had been committed twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said in court that in 2006 her friends told Ms. Randle, who was also heavily involved in surfing and cycling, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris, “You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been awful for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even worse is the fact that if she hadn’t done so, the case probably wouldn’t have been brought to trial at all.”
"I would particularly like to stress the consequences, according to Stephanie's parents, that your crime has had on their daughter over the years," he said.
"Obviously, she would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman."
An officer who has lost data will be charged.
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on the Waterloo train while he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents came into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the said law and nothing indicates criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would be surprising for many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought the matter was being handled internally between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who is not allowed to be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the official on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot included covert analyses of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
Cooperative back-ups face B&B debt
British cooperative back-ups may have to deal with more than <0xC2><0xA3>80m in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14bn to Bradford & Bingley to protect deposits of 2.6 million clients.
Interest on this loan will be repaid by all companies that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Association of Cooperative Foundations (BSA), said he was “humiliating” that the backups and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest, which is accumulated in the meantime, will repay every year all 700 financial companies that take client deposits.
The Fund's Monetary Services Compensation Plan for the BBC confirmed that all 59 cooperative foundations are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved prudently... must now repay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so prudent by far.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the back-up should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will rise to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
That means the bailouts will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay off the first-year interest.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the cooperative based association, told the BBC that he was convinced it was not fair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the boom of the housing market must now repay some of the accounts of those institutions that have not been so prudent.”
According to the BSA, no backups have fallen since 1945, when they appeared.
“Over the next few weeks, we will have to explore all aspects of this matter to see what the options are to protect the cooperative back-ups and their members from an account that could be substantial,” Cole added.
Interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, there will be interest for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative back-ups are joint-stock organizations without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk increases by five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy Company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence hike in February, and comes after a survey conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to reflect the price at customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
Bangladeshi ex-premier's bail denied
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid to be released on bail, meaning that if she returns home, she could be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail on charges of blackmailing a businessman for more than fifty million dollars ($729,700) when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalida Ziya, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released earlier this month on bail.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the local army-held government first give her complete freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was released on her word of honor to undergo medical treatment abroad, it is unclear under the terms of her release whether she will remain at large until she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now appealing to the Supreme Court against a Supreme Court order.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaykh Hasina's bail request, saying he does not need bail when he is already undergoing examinations abroad on an honorary statement," her lawyer, Rafique-ul Huq, said in a statement.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to be able to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
A senior League official said Shaykh Hasina is due to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to be able to go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasina and Khalida Ziy<0xC3><0xA1> both deny all the charges against each other.
Fear of polio vaccinations in Afghanistan
According to the UN, nearly 200,000 children have not been vaccinated against polio in recent years because of violence linked to the Taliban.
The U.N. last week carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she was unable to reach children in the south in parts of Helmand and Kandahar for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said that despite the Taliban’s promises that it would not attack or prevent thousands of vaccine workers from working.
BSkyB loses ITV litigation
BSkyB has lost a legal dispute over the review of the Commission’s Competition Decision, which ordered the company to reduce its stake in the competing broadcaster ITV.
The BSkyB Competition Court of Appeal ordered that its shareholding in ITV be reduced from 17,9 % to 7,5 %.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share had hindered the competition and had given the company a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the share in 2006 in a store, which as a result prevented the company NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, ITV to buy.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Authority announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB gave rise to doubts about the independence of ITV and called on the Competition Commission to initiate an investigation.
Virgin consortium chief Sir Richard Branson, a consumer organization and Ofcom regulator were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and as a solution disproportionate - mainly because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The move came in a situation where a report on the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticised White House officials, lawmaker and former Justice Minister Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in order to obstruct justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in the report: “Serious allegations, including potential criminal acts, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said lawyers had been fired because of weak performances.
However, it later turned out that the dismissals of lawyers were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the dismissals were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against Democrats.
U.S. lawyers investigate and prosecute cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but they may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Gonzales’ role in the affair, saying he was “principally responsible” for the dismissal, that he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “not remarkably involved” in the event.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece will be awarded
Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for her epic anthem, Bat Out of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honored" by the recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which was shortlisted in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said, “There are some songs that stand over things like time and genre, and Bat Out of Hell is definitely one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed big vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with the instrumental part, which lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at 15th place.
But Meat Loaf's album, Bat Out of Hell, has been on the charts for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated on for irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and maybe soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other roadways, some famous, others only useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village neighborhood, and it leads north from First Street - without going to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it resembles a dusty passage rather than a traffic jam.
There are no street signs.
In a conventional atlas, it is virtually invisible.
Nevertheless, the street has admirers.
For example, the company Avalon Bay, the developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to pave the Extra Place and create a cleaner passage to the shops and boutiques that are to be opened in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say that they were fascinated by the shortened alley simply because it was one of the last remnants from the time the block was refined.
However, the municipal office for the protection and development of buildings, which has the street in its power, does not have the slightest interest in sticking to it.
At a meeting of the municipal land committee, representatives of the city administration and Avalon Bay company drafted a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, District Manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee favours the option of the street remaining in the hands of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession," she said.
“Repair and administration proposals could be made, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to repave the small street and set up seats, several of which would be used by the cafe, whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first announced at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main intention is to repair this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public," she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Authority, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that his office’s job was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark in history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorn's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the background photo on the cover of Ramones' album Rocket to Russia.
“The place was amazing,” says Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of rubbish, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about the upgrading of the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity – an almost unchanged piece of town that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah’s Disappearing New York (subtitled “The Book of Weeping: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the City in the Process of Extinction”), posted part of the story about Extra Place from the Let’s Talk About the City section, which appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow dead end, dark even in the daytime and bounded by rusty iron doors of warehouses and clogged windows, where a week old newspaper runs in the rafters."
Except for a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same on a recent night.
The rat ran through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today there is an expensive clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and next to a fresh batch of discarded newspapers lay an empty beer bottle.
A few passers-by said that they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that he might use a lanyard.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thought that some people underestimated the avenue’s impressiveness in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places dark, wet and disgusting."
Debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this issue of Education Focused, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss candidates’ attitudes towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an academic in California and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, co-authored the book “Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools.”
Effectively reaching out to Hispanic voters is a tricky matter.
Barack Obama's educational agenda only proves it.
Obama’s campaign notes that “Afro-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat such performance differences, Obama’s education agenda advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
But the question for Barack Obama remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in the Los Angeles East district.
In the vast majority of cases, the pupils of this school are Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Yet in the 2008 state math tests, an incredible one hundred percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level.
Almost the same astonishing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade pupils reached the highest level in state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than that preferred by Obama.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, continuous assessment of abilities, and an unexcused approach.
Further, and Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is “full immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost privileged use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with one brand new student from Mexico - after twelve months you would enter a class and not know who it is."
"It works," she said, "for us it works."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large proportions of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The school’s results should make the answer to this question self-evident, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own consistent support for bilingual education obscure the prediction of Obama’s answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about “only English” laws.
Instead, “you should make sure your children speak Spanish,” he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil falls sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid fears that even the U.S. plan to save financial markets would not need to revive the economy.
Oil futures prices fell in early morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange by up to 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than $20 per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street and also by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, after which huge uncertainty in the financial markets sprang up.
Anxiety gripped investors again on Monday, even after the U.S. Congressional Presidium announced it had reached an agreement on the biggest bailout in history this weekend.
This report has been overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive dissolution, the government announced that Citigroup would buy a banking arm of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the furious weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy “appear to be unable to revive market sentiment.”
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for the global stock, interest rates and exchange rates markets has become highly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the US virus will spread to the whole world, and especially to China.”
The bank’s analysts narrowed their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and lowered their forecasts for gasoline prices by about 20% for 2009.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record
After spending more than anyone in the Jets’ jersey over the past eight seasons, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a glamorous ride.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals faced the cloudy clouds above them with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuez Coles on a 12-yard touchdown sprint, perfecting the afternoon in which their progressively developing collaboration moved a mile forward.
Favre sent Coles in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the one in which the cornerback fell, and another 10 seconds before half the game.
"It was nothing extraordinary," Favre said of all his passes to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We communicated well, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were wrestling, the defense was attacking Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray throw and returned it by 32 yards on touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith picked out another pass and caught it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner into a fume.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best.
Team Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal from the field, thus gaining a lead of 34-0.
That's the most the Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without an answer, Mangini said, "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than the third.
A lot of points fell in a short period of time."
Rested Gebreselassie improves his world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best long-distance runner ever when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
With a win on a pleasantly flat track in a time of 2:03:59 he beat his previous time of 2:04:26, which he ran last year in Berlin, by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, who is 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly wide - he has broken the world record or at least is a world champion at all distances from a metric mile to a marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie omitted an Olympic marathon in Beijing because he feared - in hindsight perhaps too scared - that polluted air irritated his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In near-perfect conditions – sunny and 48 degrees at takeoff, 55 degrees at the finish line – Gebreselassie won on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
With track runners such as Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya focusing on longer tracks, the marathon record for the last decade has fallen by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters he had cramps in his calves two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break seemed to wake him up rather than delay him.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little in doubt today, but everything was fine.”
He has also been criticized - especially in Kenya, the East African rival of Ethiopia - for over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world's marathon tops, relying on conductors as if it were a race on the track, and setting world records above the sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running qualities.
Maintained at a pace of four Kenyans reached Gebreselassie half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the conductors fell, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little more than three miles before the finish, Gebreselassie last took and escaped Kwambai, who then finished in second place in 2:05:36, thus improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkov<0xC3><0xA1>, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, finished an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliffe from the United Kingdom.
Sixty-six-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> surprisingly won the London Marathon in the spring of last year in the time of 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what has been described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run a big lead and then pulled them up after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of the larger Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and gigantic, lies a quiet city in which the pride and complexity of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good swimmers, enough quava, two good prisons."
Now it is a pilgrimage place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Eatonville’s annual Zora! festival to pay homage to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains aloof, though it has made it a stopover for tourists by including it in a Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers project of the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and did not share their true feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in the year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, calls for an open debate on races, many locals remain wary of the views of strangers.
“We pay close attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city’s oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of black ascension and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is double the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also an oak shielded example of southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes praised - that emerged from American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the locals are both proud and protective.
And the worries about the idea of Eatonville really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt books full of acronyms such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five passages of the Florida tourist guide turned the city a short distance to Route 17, which leads through the often overlooked center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the splash of the big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of the first Eatonville mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left by the road," she wrote, "is a white brown decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and a playground that Howard Miller always takes care of, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned the widow’s new husband, Dash, and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits an hour-long hotel.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
This was obviously not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
“Zora said it the way it was,” says Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson Girls who made Hurston immortal by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a crispy eccentric who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she arrived in the city, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to wear decent clothes.
Most residents were fascinated, Franklin said, but many grumbled.
"The Zor people have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, swinging on a chair in the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her, along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood its significance to the world or its legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, Wrapped in Rainbows.
Change came in the 1980s.
Representatives of Orange County wanted to stretch a five-lane highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane main road.
Orlando's scaling has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still getting out of a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for the mixing of races brought hatred to the threshold of the community.
"At the time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and stuff at the people who were sitting on the side," Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady here who was killed by it.
They threw a watermelon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, and her decision in Brown's case against the Education Chamber stated that it was "offensive to my race rather than glorifying."
Residents now claim that the desegregation of schools, although positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
“Negro kids used to hug — I remember — you hug your teacher in the morning, you hug your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted as long as the teachers and pupils came from the same place, she added.
"You're not hugging your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who like her have risen above prejudices with reckless self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker traveled to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to revive her reputation.
Five years later, Hurston’s acclaimed biography by Robert E. Hemenway came to the shelves in bookstores, re-incorporating her into the American canon.
The project with the highway arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramps again.
Hurston's former neighbors now considered her a savior.
To show what could happen with its highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and many return to the celebration every January.
After several years, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five streams of the highway have resurrected, you would say, a real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd put it more simply: "Dawn saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped to change the image of the city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church in 1993, began appearing in larger numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the repainted and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes act as a dead end in summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, it is 90% black.)
Strangers who come looking for the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance and certain things – such as wall paintings in Eatonville’s oldest church painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Jones, a brave, confident teacher who likes deep red, are still afraid that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew, domestic pride also increased.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, with problems and so on, but not better, not worse, and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
The voice of Franklin’s nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, echoes a sincere love for the community as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or the police, which he says he would use some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they just pass by, think, 'Well, this town is nothing against the others,'" said Alondra Kenon, recently after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York we all speak fluently financially
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from newspaper stands and huge TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn’t have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never have guessed that in the glassy beehive of offices above their heads, every day, bankers and investment fund managers monopolizing New York City have had the worst “bad day at the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The messengers are still roaring with metal carts on the sidewalks and transporting muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Hispanics are still moving between the towers and wearing, like human mules, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the swings on their backs.
The office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and it’s still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between four and seven in the afternoon.
It didn’t look like a crisis at all until, with all the talk of pessimism, I decided to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had timed this task to cover the late afternoon session at my local J.P. Morgan Chase branch, there were already about twenty people in the queue.
Not in front of checkout windows to pick up or deposit cash, but in front of a counter where older clients order cheque books, tourists ask about the way to the Macy's Mixed Goods Store, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my “licensed personal banker,” came for the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already collected their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They raised money from so-called thrifts (slightly similar to construction savings banks), money associations, and from those types of savings banks whose branches operate in only one state and which claim to care for their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly gone bankrupt.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion worth of assets, went into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion worth of assets, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The office and shop staff, who stood in front of me and feared another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the Wall Street bailouts.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned fluently in financial terms over the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket was talking on the phone and expressing herself to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her depleted chief executive Dick Fulda with such familiarity as if she were chatting about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, roughly 50-year-old housekeeper of my apartment, changed the subject of our usual conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me, “I now have my savings in money market funds.
I've moved it, I'm not taking any risks."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing break
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, of the Austrian right-wing Svobodn<0xC3><0xBD> party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, are taking part in a demonstration that presented "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They bear signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
Over 90 graves at a cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly damaged between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized action.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols on some graves, such as the Star of David, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask the motifs of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of defilement that comes as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the cycle of seeking its own soul after a swing to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which collectively garnered more than 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Union for the Future of Austria, campaigned vehemently against immigration and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, which received more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against scarves and burqas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be related to Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was mainly caused by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glamrock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials have imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that it plans to travel through France to Spain.
Kenyan police agreed to the travel ban on Thursday after handing over evidence of Glitter’s previous convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, by his own name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford's lowest criminal court in Kent, but was represented by lawyers at Corker Binning.
“On Thursday, September 25, at Ashford’s lowest criminal court, the Kent police asked for a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally involved."
The 64-year-old Glitter told authorities he wanted to travel abroad, according to a sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to give the planned departure date to the police a week in advance.
If he neglected to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's possible trips around the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who stays in the UK, because we have extensive systems that deal with potential dangers more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent police, and we are working hard to monitor the behavior of recorded sex offenders in order to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through the passport control and eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On August 22, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney, David Corker, went to Uxbridge's lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time, Scotland Yard successfully requested an order to register him as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously imprisoned in the UK for four months for possession of child pornography.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, was calm and glad Glitter had been prevented from traveling to France and Spain.
"To capture the true character, I photograph the master off-stage." Günther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no calls, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, disconnected from the concentration on interpretation - just so I can achieve a relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the second - a man.
Inseparable, aside from privacy, in those moments away from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of a fleeting glance, or the passionate gesture of hands that are carefree, because they are not going to step on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-people" alternates the theatricality of performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer composes a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which takes place as part of the Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca program, “reflects the ever-increasing international importance of flamenco,” says the author, and explains that “Flamenco-people” “can be any people, but when you look at the photos, you find that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and completely captivate the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take photos on stage.
He wears his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Fascinated by the Cante de las Minas festival, Bauer began a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a record camera in 1997.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble a classic photograph.
The use of different stylistic means runs counter to the classical basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also reflects flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which does not cease to surprise and develop."
What draws the audience is not the action of the dance itself, the singing or the play, but the personality and character of the artist.
Finding the moment when we encounter the most essential, the spirit that manifests itself in the way of perception, being and experiencing, that was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata Gallery.
This selection of nearly seventy photographed artists is shaped by well-known flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and will soon receive a book edition, which will contain the exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea at the "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "to take pictures of people, to get to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment, whether long or short - this is my passion.
I think in photography, a portrait is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities he sometimes does not even know, or gives him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite such circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of the contemporary flamenco artist called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galleria El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he writes is “courageousness”
Set in an environment he doesn’t know yet and telling stories of events unknown to him, Mario Vargas Llosa plans to successfully realize his new project – he is currently working on a novel whose protagonist is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and traveled to the Amazon.
The eternal favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that currently employs him is "braveness" and that "everything suggests that I should not write" this novel.
“If I had reason, I wouldn’t do it, but I will, and I believe that one day I will finish it,” he concluded his contribution to the festival of exchanging ideas, ideas and words, which saw hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people in the city of the aqueduct in four days.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for Favorite Writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled Juan Bravo's theater to the last place.
With Félix Duque, who introduced him, he had a devoted audience, whose hour of time has passed like water, and who, with an amazing accuracy and a note of humour, remembered in him how he remembered from the original "incredible adventure" the "pleasure of a passionate reader" and from "the power of living more than I am"
The Hispanic novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out whether and to what extent books can change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa stressed, according to him, "affects people" and "forces them to try to get out of their ranks", and challenged the writer, "let's face it"
Due to climatology, the festival in Pozoblanc is lost - spears are missing
The spear performance, which concludes the ceremony in Pozoblanc, was cancelled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition was confirmed.
Therefore, the company, together with Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable meteorological conditions have plagued the festival for a long time, as two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second planned bullfights.
During this time, José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena of Castilblanca.
This is how it was celebrated only on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and the reward for a dynamic and aesthetically good performance was presented on his shoulders.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two spear wounds for salutes and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than Toreador art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bull arena of Los Llanos unleavened fat.
In the second round of hard work, without a single breath, he earned sharp criticism from most of the audience.

Officers stop two people in a van and they get away.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is not to be stopped.
According to a report by the Interior Department of the Basque government, they were pursued and detained by a person in a van, a 38-year-old man identified as A.A.J.
The suspect was charged with drug smuggling and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out road checks on the N-1 in places where it passes the border of the city district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not obey the instructions, accelerated sharply and ran away.
Members of the car immediately began to chase, until the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers further, at which point both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
Ertzaintza officers eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a tour of the Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "squeezed" and did not agree with the data provided in the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detained A. A. J., 28, was taken to the police department to handle the proper formalities before later proceeding with further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for drug-induced driving
Actress Heather Locklear, a favorite Amanda from Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "walked hard on the gas, roaring loudly, moving forward and backward, trying to get out of the parking lot - she went over her sunglasses several times while reversing".
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear a moment after she stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the rescue service because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived at the scene, they found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo the test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress cooperated and the excessive amount of alcohol was immediately eliminated, but "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was evident to the officers at first sight."
Locklear was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance, and around 7 p.m. she was taken into custody, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from the clinic, recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, the IU’s chief general and MP for the United Left, said today that the final decision in the case of former Seville City Hall Youth and Sports Councillor Francisco Manuel Silva, who stepped down last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, would depend on the party’s regional association.
"I'm too federal for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said in a statement.
However, the head of the IU insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of the investigation of Silva's illegal conduct: "The IU has always fought to make such matters as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Sangre de mayo", Garcia's epic bet
José Luis Garci in the film "May Blood" (Sangre de mayo), to which he was inspired by Episodes from the national past Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, revives the famous uprising of the Spaniards against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of about 15 million e.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "drawing the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of the society", which he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, during the presentation of the film in front of an extensive team of artists.
May's blood, over two-and-a-half hours in size, will be released in theaters this Friday and a more than four-hour TV series for Telemadrid is set to air in the future.
As a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s' literary work, José Luis Garci claims that he fulfilled his "children's dream" by filming this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to shoot the film for the two-hundredth anniversary of the 2nd of May, he accepted the offer from Epiz.
The $15 million budget, to which the province of Madrid has fully contributed, means a "unique opportunity" for Garcia to create an environment with backstage and costumes matching the image of "a cracking Spain that was mistaken in the leader for whom it was going to fight - the struggle for independence led under Ferdinand VII to the country's decline and backwardness," he said.
But the director regrets that he can’t count on the financial support that came to the films Sad Wing (Ala Triste) or Goy’s Ghosts – almost double May Blood – so he couldn’t film some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film "Start Again" (Volver and Empezar) works as usual - on the stage together with the actors with whom he usually rehearses before filming and who does not choose casting, because it seems to him "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's profession is to go to theaters and cinemas, among other things."
Many of the actors he chose for May Blood have already appeared in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflower, represents the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but claims that "they are only just emerging".
Garcia does not expect any awards for this film.
“At first, you think you’re working for what comes next, but then you realize you’re only working for a profit, so you’re willing to make another film,” Garci explains with more than 30 years of directing career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual legacy of the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia
Sevillan flamenco dancer pays tribute to another Sevillan dancer.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from her Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dances.
She lived a life of passion, pioneering women's emancipation such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enchanted by Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me - it seemed incredible."
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of flamenco rhythms.
So "butterfly dance" was evoking me guajira or "snake dance" some kind of tango.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic,” she says.
The performance involves the involvement of two exceptional personalities: Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance as well as in "Open Doors" (La puerta abierta), and dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to cooperate with her former classmate.
"Matilde represents an older Tortola, a mature figure.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project and it is a great honour for me.”
In the performance he also counts on the music and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paca Arriaga, who are always behind them, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the drums of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jara, the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of the actor Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who has the role of the eternal one".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who took place for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a lot of influence at some point, but nobody knows her today and even less appreciates her work," Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n said.
The performance starts today at 8.30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Diary of a Newly Married Man" also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly Married Diary" at the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the site where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trinal of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n of the Year" (2006-present).
The "Zenobie and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Trial" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, a renovation of the Nobel Museum House and a travel exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Sun Beam", which was opened in May of this year, and after the provincials had toured the various and
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Andalusian Government also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Diary" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue spreading awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most sacred Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like each other that much.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intention" and, under the weight of knowing that Newman has left, reveals his disillusioned vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He knew that he was seriously ill.
He was still a man for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels cannot be expressed in any way, and I have now lost a great friend," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country have been made better by him."
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of film and homeland died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom, when they are desperately looking for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people without virtues and just a handful of those who are worthy of your admiration - you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from the Drug Addiction Foundation based in honor of his first-born son who died of an overdose, to his own brand of home-made food and bio-food.
A complete treasure for a country that has cost a lot of effort to rid itself of a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but a whole era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was without exaggeration the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dares to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
“That fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us,” says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today has the courage to try to live as Paul Newman has lived – he’s based on honesty and leads a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he liked to joke.
Let him be accompanied in heaven by the pride that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was the most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a selfless philanthropist."
Imperfect races at the Olympic Games in Madrid
Yes, many of us want the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask: are we ready?
If we're going to run yesterday's race, I'm going to say no!
He was referred to as the perfect race, and in my judgment he was the worst I've ever been to.
Such a slew of nonsense that if there were an evaluation right away and I was the examiner, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let’s look at it from the beginning, one by one.
Nonsense begins with picking up a race number, for which one has to leave early.
That doesn’t seem bad to me, but when you go there, let them give you everything (including a chip to avoid overrunning the track).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (the first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after standing the appropriate queue) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (the second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because they are less fabric and are cheaper?
Well, that's a little bit compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go very soon for the chip and the queue took over 15 minutes, he had to give up his backpack.
Over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is in a race where 11,000 people are expected, something incomprehensible.
So, as you would expect, the race started and we haven’t put our backpacks down yet, and when we did, it was much worse with the pick-up.
In addition, the wait was extended by 40 minutes of rain, leading to widespread riots and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow and some, like me, will not see the right time to evaluate the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I assume, did not correctly record my start time.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, this one wouldn't have thought of me.
So I think we're going to have to let ourselves dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At a conference on new technologies at MIT, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system of image recognition and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but able to perform basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger who would move around the company's premises) and perceive what he hears in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
It can also sort attendees by conversation group.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to him, and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see someone and tells her that he's going to focus on her in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Awesome.
This is, of course, the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of the Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and won’t have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer came to the conclusion that if computers had only the essentials, without the burden of commercial uselessness, they would be five times more powerful — man, Steve, they would be cheaper.
Discover as thunder when you consider that the Microsoft version from the version adds to Windows new features and other "extra".
A change of direction would be a meritorious act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing importance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who leaned towards the theory that it was Google’s first step to competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
An operating system will always be necessary because it is the necessary layer to communicate between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It never disappears, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and, conversely, to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the Internet every day than around windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I have a small example here.
I took this photo in a rest room for Microsoft employees in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
There was a poster on the vending machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed, by the way.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let’s count on 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shone in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford's "The Godfather" Coppola, and in addition it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to go into the list of his life roles, we can dive into the image of a typical muscle with a pointed moustache that lifts weights in a nomadic circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton men's tank top, tight and sleeveless.
English speakers call it 'tank', but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, for its ghoulish name - although popularly called 'Marcel' - which has to do with sports, because, according to legend, it was named after boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above other quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost inconspicuous) Belgian flag, which models have the most iconic tank tops as a detail at the neck.
And beware, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, children's clothes, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for a comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother. Whoever becomes a father doesn't bother me."
The enormous appearance of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, though small, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, it means so much more than just that some pretty, famous girls lend their name.
In Paris, she participated in a promotional event held by Mango at its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most important fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
She is kind and shy and will get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to introduce the new collection that my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I attended the announcement of the second year of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and a dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
It was a difficult but also exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for the company Mango, for which you have been working for the fourth season?
My sister and I love films from the 50s and 60s and we have drawn a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to wander around the city and watch women walk around dressed, combine and layer their clothes, which I do very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
For example, I liked clothes from an early age, I still wanted to go to my grandmother's, to check in my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was a sensation, almost better than going to the pilgrimage.
When I became a dancer, I always tried to keep my clothes on.
You know, we dancers rely on how we're adjusted to feel good about our lessons and rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You're in your 30s recently, and you're in a crisis?
No, I'm not.
I'm feeling better than ever, I'm having fun in my 30s.
I find that the woman is already finished, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
From a young age, I do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don't want to miss it.
As for my father, I'm not worried about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
That’s right, and I’m looking forward to seeing them in the movies.
I come from the theater world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything right now and so of course it is not possible.
I look forward to the premiere of "La ultima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let's see how you like them...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the pier with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say it.
It's not like I'm going up the pier as a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to attend a benefit show for her organization, Women for a Better Life, and the clothes we were showing -- I also picked two models from our collection for Mango -- and the proceeds went to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
Many things are said about her, and I can tell you that many of them are not true because I know her.
Besides, I'll stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I will do it too.
I will do what is necessary for the benefit of the women of the third world.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal became known in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme Public Prosecutor's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its goal is to bring the driver back behind the wheel, which is why drivers will also have to take a retraining course.
In addition to the National Office for Transport Safety, the General Directorate of Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75 percent of motorists accused of driving intoxicated more than once will get behind the wheel again.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe beforehand or if a higher than the permissible concentration of alcohol is recorded.
Its price exceeds 1,000 euros and the culprit would have to pay it.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that in the first year after the introduction of this equipment, the offences were reduced by 65 %.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And in order to help its implementation, since the legal regulation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of criminal provisions, however, requires a change of the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Tomorrow, Congress will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing the system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
At 5:40 p.m., a Spanish Air Force plane landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in México D.F., where the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun was just setting, but its rays still forced the eyes to close their hands so that the next pair could be seen coming out of the plane.
The Spanish ambassador and other officials stood under the stairs.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, well, that's great, it won't be able to get to the airport to get people...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport right next to the red carpet and military cordon, which consists of 27 naval soldiers ready to fire an honor salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color, and the princess, very modestly dressed and with loose hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently they reported to her that there is a threat of a storm in D. F.
Before they move into the room where the official delegation awaits, they smile at the photographers and pose for them.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a talkative Mexican TV reporter is waiting for them.
Best subsidized fashion price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion prize than Paris, and there is probably no better designer and bonvivant than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable international presentation to new fashion talents.
The price is subsidized by <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, yesterday looked at her proposals in the exhibition Manga on the Paris boulevard Haussmann number 54 and almost cried with emotion.
Of course, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
Many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to finally have a sumptuous dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
Mango's ceremonially decorated presidential desk looked even more amazing next to Chagall's most famous works.
Nati, who was heartbroken by her brother's recent death, put on the brand's clothes and the ELAH jewellery that had been hidden in her breath, and hung on her son Louis, a nearly two-meter-high elder, accompanied Valentin at the head of the dinner table in his honor.
Andik, the head and owner of the Mango company, took up the welcome, and as a true gentleman he remained, along with Baron Rothschild, without a jacket, as they both offered it to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who arrived at the store in - hand-designed - trousers and shirts and dressed herself in long black sexy dresses for dinner, was touched by a night walk around the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledo, showed us the ballroom and, in remembrance of other times, "caught up one of the poles and snatched herself on top of one of the poles".
Inés Sastre did not hesitate to tour the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone.
The next morning we could admire the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another young man riding a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own linen and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances should be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh l<0xC3><0xA0> l<0xC3><0xA0>, c'est la vie.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not a thousand, but a thousand plus one way to forget the chaotic and furious everyday life.
All of them are summarized in one book, which will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30th.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hasty rhythm that current life brings.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat day-to-day exhaustion and detach yourself from the world of work.
No, the number is no bigger and no smaller than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yogic position, classic massage and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, has collected a whole "menu" of options, adjusted according to the taste and time possibilities of each individual.
The book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If someone believes that it is impossible to achieve peace in areas such as work or personal relationships, the "manual" denies this view.
In addition, it offers additional procedures for being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in your body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn it off, and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don’t mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may frighten you, but in reality it is meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquie.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure many of you have been told that he spoke in his sleep at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fever), or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single reason for her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders such as nightmares, nightmares, enuresis nocturna or sleepwalking, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or inflamed situations.
In any case, this is a little explored phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or vice versa (screaming, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests itself with great force, it would be advisable to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and in this way manifests itself.
We have said that this is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb your child too much before going to bed.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who can relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them gain a certain inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When the somniloquie appears, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that it is harmless to the child and that from what happened, he will remember nothing the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake him.
It is useless because he is not conscious and you interrupt his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and so he rests.
Keep in mind that if you feel that you are having a lot of trouble several times in a row, it is advisable to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If you understand what he says (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and pull information from him.
It will be useless, because when he sleeps, he is not conscious so that he can organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he is saying, but you do not know what he is dreaming about, and therefore why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell your child that you can ask him or her about his or her secrets at night.
Not for fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way back to victory after a long, lean period.
Without playing a particularly big match, the Yellow-and-Blacks created more chances and were able to turn one of them victoriously.
The game did not have a very fast pace during this encounter, in which the attackers were difficult to enforce.
After the captain's first attempt, Kauffmann, who had missed the junction from a distance, began to have the Illhaeusern lightly, and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hire by air, Romain by long leg or also Diebold, gradually came to irritate Dannemaria's defense.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wall in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi on the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved to be decisive, first thanks to two chances of Dannemaria with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after opening the score for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, well positioned for processing the ball rebounded after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
Illhaeusern's goalkeeper, however, did not enjoy the joy for a long time, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates in a weakened state.
Dannemaria, however, was unable to make the most of it, and the eleventh of Illhaeusern, who had only retreated a little to "densify" the defense, had caused no greater difficulty, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the log after great confusion.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before departing for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a drive through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the power of fishermen who severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to head to Guilvinec port in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives there.
The latter pledged to be accepted "in a constructive spirit" and hoped to "come up with concrete proposals".
The president's visit comes at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen in order to get measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
According to Elysee Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions for employing and paying seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with relentlessness.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out a "snail" operation (an operation of slow-moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10 km of congestion.
The holiday port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections in the direction of Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was put into operation on the Quiberon Peninsula.
Sailors demonstrated their determination as early as Monday, when tyres and pallets were burned in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where the trawlers remained in the port, or Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday for a meeting at the ministry.
The "crisis committee" in Guilvinec is due to decide on Tuesday how to continue on the path taken and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the State Fisheries Department, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not give up" and "they do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, head of the Lorient fisheries department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the tax on diesel currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but they believe that the threshold of profitability of the ship is reached only when the diesel is below 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman
Butche Cassidy and Kid have died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes all bowed to the film legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its supply assumptions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that looms over the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft designer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 deliveries with 215 deliveries, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in a span of eight years.
AIG plans to transfer 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurer, which the U.S. monetary authorities have taken over, is considering ceding more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion he was given as a deposit, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
AIG is ready to investigate the sale of most of its activities outside of life insurance in the international field and pension activities in the United States, the daily said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG board of directors met on Sunday evening to investigate possible assignments.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp. aviation leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the insurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must urgently obtain cash in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities seize 80% of its capital, while diluting it into an appropriate ratio of current shareholders.
Paris. Analysis of the historical meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s bailout plan: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) fell by 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trade resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, with the dominant technology component, lost, according to definitive data after the closing of trading, 199.61 points and settled to 1,983.73, and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
Depressed from the beginning of the session, Wall Street literally collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the House bailout plan, a plan that was supposed to allow the markets to find some stability again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to provide Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that sees Congress unable to accept a certain plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late".
“If this project is indeed doomed to collapse (...), the relay will be immediately handed over to the Fed and other central banks in order to ignite the crisis, which would further solidify credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States, “every new day brings the collapse of one financial institution.”
After the collapse of Washington Mutual on Friday, the Wachovia Bank’s banking activities were bought by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly picked up momentum and called for urgent interventions in favour of banks in the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing “not just the American crisis, but the global crisis.”
The bond market has risen sharply.
Revenue from the 10-year cash voucher fell to 3.632% compared to 3.827% on Friday evening, revenue for 30-years to 4.161 % compared to 4.357 % the previous day.
Obama wins points in first TV duel
After the first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday, a second debate was held to determine which of the two candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, won.
The Republican-Democrat campaign command tents were not surprised when both announced their victory in a television duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, however decent, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, the decline in polls.
The Gallup Institution, whose opinion poll published on Saturday attributed Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% for McCain), believes that the Democrat is the winner in the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% attributes the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday through the expected good performance of his co-candidate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
“She’s talented,” Bill Clinton said at the weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain consistently emphasized his undeniable experience in foreign policy, while also emphasizing the "naiveness" of his opponent in the issues that formed the core of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama didn't seem to understand that..." was the repeated accusation.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has enough experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
In such an offensive spirit, there have been Republican television spots since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved himself short and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still didn't get it, while Obama did," the Democratic spot said last weekend, blaming the Republican for not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "common American."
“During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people gathered at a rally in North Carolina.
He hasn't even uttered words like "middle class" or "working." The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the edge of the abyss.
"There could be a decisive turnaround next week," said Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “economic foresight” to Bill Clinton’s during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic nominee, the current disaster is “the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policy, as pursued by George Bush and as supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reiterated that despite Wall Street’s unexpected jumps, he should be able to reduce taxes on 95% of Americans, and also pointed out that realizing the country’s possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial aid plan, which Congress passed last night and which is highly unpopular.
"Did you notice that an election was held in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after polling stations were closed in Minsk’s main square to protest the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people have come to demonstrate against President Lukashenko's regime: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn’t even go to the polls: “What good would it be if they did whatever they wanted with my voice anyway,” says one young man.
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be ready to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including visa bans for 40 Belarusian heads of state and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if elections are considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of 12 parties.
"It's a cosmetic change," says Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because who counts the votes is important, and in our country it's executive power.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by appointing them, not by electing them.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and draft laws.”
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political functioning, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
It stresses that participation seems too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulations.
"What, did you notice that there were any elections?" asks Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
"There was not a foot in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the ones who most suit the regime."
The silence of the night was once again contained in the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - The Blood That's Sure Again
Hema-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted because Hema-Québec has become one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
First of all, he regained public confidence, which was seriously shaken after the scandal with contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is widely known, the national blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated with the Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In view of this drama and the wave of public reluctance, the Canadian Government launched in February 1994 a public inquiry, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and formulating recommendations to prevent such a disaster from happening again.
While Judge Krever delayed handing over the report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this role was taken up by the Gélinea Committee.
Following Gélineau's and Krever's report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec, which was to be administered by Québec, and the Canadian Blood Company to supply all provinces and both territories.
“When Hema-Québec started its activities in 1998, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the Québec blood system,” recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was depressing.
With our continued efforts to increase the safety of blood products and our continued work in this area over the years, we have regained public trust," he says and proudly adds that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Québec population had trusted Hema-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its inception on September 28, 1998, Hema-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
“At that time, we saw many human cases of mad cow disease in Europe, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,” says the woman, who has led the company since its inception in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread in blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, according to which, when we do not know and when the spread of a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, it is necessary to take exclusionary measures.
In April 1999, we therefore refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that sticking to the precautionary principle made sense.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in the donor blood directly the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests previously used were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deaf period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors might be infected without knowing it and without being able to figure it out.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of getting blood contaminated with HIV.
“In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through a blood product to occur.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe the blood transfusion necessary for healing in complete peace,” said the head of the Hema-Québec leadership.
“The challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what kind of germs can appear in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted to the blood by stabs of insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," Dr. Décary continues, stressing that, in addition to a safe supply, Hema-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“The demand is growing as the population ages.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate.”
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14% of people offering blood are not accepted because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where mud fever is raging, they are excluded for one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a condition that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how they age and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to persuade people to give blood, especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donors.
“Life is so unfettered today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood,” Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for major burns.
These tissues are analysed, processed and frozen before they are deposited at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, formerly considered biomedical waste, abounds in blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000th cord blood sample into the bank, and we expect to collect over 1,000 of it annually.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants,” says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood program as very popular.
"Some mothers are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Hema-Québec doesn't have enough resources to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all the hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montreal qualified for the semi-final round of the USL First Division knockout series yesterday at the Saputo Stadium during the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals played on the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 victory (4:3 is the goal balance after both games) over the Sounders of Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a two-sided goalless first half, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino netted the remaining two goals of the Montreal Formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could handle Matt Jordan in favor of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of two matches of the quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
In the semi-finals, Impact will match his strength with the Whitecaps of Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder made a 3-1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round with a total goal count of 5:4.
Impact is due to clash with Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will only be confirmed today.
Short - Kovalev's winning goal
The first attacking trio of Canadiens is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec and Andrej Kosticin yesterday night in Centre Bell encouraged the attack to the victory of Canadien 3:2 on separate raids.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists and Kovalev reaped one pass in this fourth three-color victory out of six preparatory matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during the independent raids.
'I'm not ready yet, 'said the Russian.
"I need another game to feel good."
"He tried too much in the first third," Guy Carbonneau remarked.
“I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause.”
Charest bets north
The Prime Minister does not rule out early elections until the end of the year.
Immediately after the end of the Liberal Party (Parti libéral) Congress, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today's complementary elections.
"To push the limits of our last great northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually engaging way at the end of the Québec Liberal Party Congress in Lévis, without giving details.
During his speech, pictures were projected behind his back in a picture grinder.
On three huge canvases, a loop ran with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
It’s a great opportunity, just like in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out triggering early elections in the fall, though he pointed out that he had a very busy agenda.
The "Plan North" forms the fourth dimension of the "vision" the Prime Minister intends for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a "jewel with huge potential", but did not specify a deadline, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
He mentioned a number of approaches to points that could be further dismantled: in particular hydroelectric power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructures.
The North, according to Charest's list, contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This "territory is twice the size of France in our country", "is in Quebec.
And it is not only in us, but it is in us," he stressed, as if to show that he is referring to a certain national founding myth.
Québec was built largely in relation to the North, the Prime Minister pointed out: the pursuit of gold in Abitiba, Québec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after stalling theatrically to see the huge map behind his back.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional position that has been repeated by all previous governments.
"There is one border line that has not been agreed for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again on behalf of the government," he said.
Otherwise, "it is also necessary to reconsider our vision of the North in the context of climate change," he said, speaking about the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that taking territory becomes an obligation.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The prime minister said that the Québec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP from Ungava), have already begun negotiations with about thirty communities.
The activity was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but the moment when "a common vision will be outlined."
Moreover, the development of the North should be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North plan will be "shared, structured and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a seamless follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was, after all, one of the still shaken topics of the weekend, which began on Friday with a big cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to the leadership of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to convert Beauharnois' headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Peaceful Revolution and the nationalization of water power, to Bourassa, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam hydroelectric power plant, Charest stressed that its launch was planned for 2012.
"I'm only saying this between us, but I plan to be there," he told his member base, causing considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend congress provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, in particular certain “constitutional change efforts” that went very smoothly: PLQ (Québec Liberal Party) demands in particular recognition of the “specificity of Quebec” in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint some members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council who would have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was sceptical in its main features.
PQ (Parti Québecois) chief Pauline Marois again pulled out the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by Landry's government in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, she gave up the implementation of this policy.
If she did, "we would go on today," Marois said alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mercure.
ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we wish it wasn't just a theater," explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from the holiday.
Letters - The Dishonored Land
It was Vic Toews, the former “justice” (o irony) minister in Harper’s cabinet, who allowed himself to say about Louis Arbour last summer that he was a “shame” for Canada.
To defame a woman who has waged a relentless fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the prime minister’s environment and Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not taken back to its homeland a citizen imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
The government, which does not take into account at all that at the time when the actions that were being reproached against him were to take place, Omar Khadr was a young adolescent.
The only government that, despite Canada signing the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets itself rot in the inhumane conditions of a child soldier.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Association of Canadian Lawyers are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can await a fair trial in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it matter that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of this, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” a word that Harper is so bent on and that sounds so empty from his mouth.
The time has come when there is no more morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the will of the head of the so far minority government (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that proclaims Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame, Mr. Toews, is in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian discourse
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he affirms that the world’s largest gold producer has launched prosecutions of three authors and a poor little publishing house for insulting honor in order to spark a “transparent public debate” and demands six million of them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge truthfulness, especially when prosecuted for insulting honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely omits this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate, to bring to ruin anyone who dares to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend and fight in a highly unbalanced fight against an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
Moreover, the tactic in these unbalanced struggles often consists in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will shut the door on the other side and, moreover, will terrify anyone who dares to engage in this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view of the matter to public opinion.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate normally lies in the exchange of ideas, not in the stab wounds.
It was therefore not enough for the mining company to open its books, its documentation, and to have a real debate through newspapers, media, publications, and the funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole matter.
Barrick Gold, however, appears to have no confidence in public opinion and slammed petitions and letters in support of the authors of the book Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" and at the same time despise the views of the same public?
In the vice president’s world, this word seems to refer only to the heavily paid lawyers, not to all Canadians; it is a rather narrow concept of the term.
In a democracy, the right to speak is also given to the oppressors.
Barrick Gold does not understand — or does not want to understand — that the public, who supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and judge the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant’s mouth should be shut (as part of their prosecution of the “public debate” the Barrick company, incidentally, has just filed an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to re-apply to them to use this.
Apart from Garver’s surreal speech, the prosecution initiated by Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to research and seek the truth that is essential to every democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to cite reliable sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that the world’s wealthy businesses do not like without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He's entitled to an answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as it is for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unwarranted prosecution.
Operations to Save Wall Street: Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the biggest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to curb the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it assumes: better control of elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of saved public money, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, and also the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to managers of rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative to the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after the end of the two-day negotiating marathon.
“We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets,” said Henry Paulson, a spokesman for the Bush administration.
“Everything has been done so that the real economy and ordinary Americans are safe from the current crisis on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t do it, the trauma, chaos and disruption of everyday life for Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the past hours, negotiations have started at maximum turnarounds out of fear of the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed rather in favor of the agreement, without neglecting to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama credited the addition of the agreement with some measures, in particular those aimed at allowing owners to maintain their residence, and measures on the wages of state-saved workers.
“When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on television.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied: "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The rough features I've read [show] that it's something we're all going to have to spend and move forward with.
To choose inaction is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back dubious debts and risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions with taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis unleashed by a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then shifted to other, more widespread forms of loans (PCAAs) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft of the agreement from last week is on the conscience of Republican MPs.
Since the Democrats have agreed that some of the “toxic” assets of troubled companies will only be guaranteed by the government, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the hopeless situation is set in motion.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, a measure was attached stipulating that the government would be able to introduce new fees that would help it get its deposit back if, as a result of the program, it had to absorb losses for five years.
The new plan envisages a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion will be added if the president deems it necessary.
An additional $350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will receive shares in the rescued companies, which in case of profit will pay him dividends and which he will be able to sell again when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for the seizure of real estate related to the loans covered by the plan, as well as to set limits on the amount of valuation and compensation paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The plan's founders would like to submit it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet clear whether their plan will have a green one.
Yesterday, both the Republican and the Democratic camps continued to oppose the project.
"It's absolutely clear that Washington can't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But earning money from taxpayers is not a solution.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Sceptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, among them three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us: We ask Congress not to rush too much and carefully examine which way to go,” he said.
At the same time, it was reaffirmed in Europe that this crisis is a global crisis.
After the end of the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which is on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis of risky loans for the purchase of real estate in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of Europe’s twenty largest banks and one of Europe’s ten largest insurers.
"We will not lose this money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos.
“In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And that’s what savers and households can appreciate in today’s uncertain times.”
On the other side of the Channel, so far, it seems, the British government has begun the nationalization of another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Brigley, of which more than 41 billion (75,5 billion USD) were loans to buy real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, the Spanish bank Santander will buy off branches and accounts of clients of the British bank.
Bradford and Brigley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalized by the British government since the financial crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Socially Engaged Icon
His beauty with azure eyes for a long time represented his trump, according to others, weakness.
Did this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensibilities, and unfailing talents that belonged to him also kept him away from the power category that breeds true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the hefty years of American cinema.
Less majestic than Brando, to whom he resembled and for a long time was his rival on film, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often gives birth to beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother a Hungarian.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without exaggerated ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it saw this whole country in love with self-made man, a fighter in the Pacific War, wounded in battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s, then attended the New York Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and soon in film.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also a car racer who placed second at the 1979 Le Mans 24-hour race and a sexual symbol, despite being a exemplary couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With him also leave the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the excitement of his own show-business, which will forever remain to some extent mysterious.
A decent man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's departure this weekend has made film lovers dizzy, while his big roles rival each other on a black canvas of memories.
After him, he defiles more than half a century of ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) resurfaces, a young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in Cat on a Hot Roof, a 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation.
From a less ancient past (1990) we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed at an advanced age by a marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, an abused, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me (In the Sign of Hate), a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which brought Newman to true prominence in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's amazing The Hustler (1961), Martin Scorsese will play the same character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, earning him one Oscar out of seven nominations in 1987.
This face wandering through the ages, that was him.
It's him again.
In his career, different eras compete with each other.
Young people know him mainly thanks to the iconic Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy by the Coen Brothers.
He ended his career as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike several film legends who left the craft fairly soon, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, although he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, pomp and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw it, not without humor, as a "living challenge to underplay", believing that in his performances he was pushing too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the role came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, losers and despairers, whose decline and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known aspects of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, offers a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
In 1984, his son Scott, who had been lost to an overdose, was given the film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sadness.
In a wave of tributes to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said sadly, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main qualities of a deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, a great civil rights activist, environmentalist, independent film, opponent of the decline of Hollywood is also leaving.
We were used to seeing his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, which we may have found rather tasteless, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Hard Childhood.
Thus, rather than being lulled by fame, Newman was engaged in society until the very last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and to the end your father was grateful to his happy planet.
I was honored to be here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a bright and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, an exemplary citizen.
What was produced at the Zuschlagag & spol. invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial will begin in the criminal proceedings against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by a long-term and systematic criminal organization, as a result of which extraordinarily significant damage was caused.
According to the prosecutor’s office, they used the money obtained in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the fulfillment of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and self-government - a total of about 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority also informed it was that the money raised in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real counter value and the undertakings never received by the association.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
Prints for these invoices came from the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of which companies are to produce invoices were decided, among other things, on a tour of the northern shore of the Balaton, to which he sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag.
According to his testimony, the first one was to look out for pensions and restaurants.
In them, he asked for bills for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices submitted in the framework of public tenders issued, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Self-Government of the capital, were then produced.
Most invoices were issued by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his partner Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
On his "study trip," Lados looked out at a pub.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering facility provided catering for a 90-member group from the Biztos Pont association.
However, so many people, according to the head of the company, would not fit into this device at once.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later Együtt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was full of formal and substantive errors.
The pension in Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, yet there were one hundred and thirty guests on the invoice.
The fillers of the forms, however, exaggerated this with a rich imagination even when they listed on the documents a company also dedicated to hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounts, according to information provided to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the documents sounding in the name of Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> did not even appear.
The head of the company Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were stamped in the wrong place."
In addition to the formalities, he added, the fact that according to the invoice they accommodated a hundred people, because they have only eleven rooms that do not have such a large capacity, did not agree.
In addition, food was also indicated on the invoice, and their restaurant has not been functioning for a long time.
The ardent invoice makers also failed to convince themselves that the booked Budapest travel agency only organizes foreign travel, and they foolishly stated on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not coincide with the company’s invoicing practice, as a travel brokerage service in Hungary.
In addition, as it turned out during the investigation, the document also stated VAT, although the organization of travel to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On four documents issued to the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o., the amount of VAT did not agree, among other things. The company’s activities were not covered by the above mentioned 25 % VAT, but by 15 % VAT, in addition, the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was written by hand.
In addition, the "publishers" spoiled the invoice, for example, by stating to one company, as it turned out thanks to the investigation of the public prosecutor's office, as the performed activity of road transport of goods, which the company based initially on investment advice did not perform.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt Foundation and the Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért and the associations of the XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyesület and Biztos Pont are false has also been broken due to formal deviations - inconsistent invoice format and incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group from the association Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért was eating, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices are consciously issued.
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they had to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to the indictment, the leading company Collab s.r.o. was forced to issue a fictitious account by one of the accused Ludovic Györfi.
Biogate s. r. o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 supplied the Jobb Jöv<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation and the associations Atlasz and Vörösfeny<0xC5><0x91> with invoices worth about five million forints, for which there was no real economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which organizations have already forgotten to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov was the authorised representative of the Ukrainian director of the company Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> s. r. o., which deals with the trade in fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but where the company is not to be found.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data obtained by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man from Romania, to whom Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov was to hand over documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the associations Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and the foundation Együtt and Harmadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért and he himself accepted their consideration.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, the Romanian masons established Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were in his favour, because at the request of the co-indicted lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> connected to Zuschlaga.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints to organizations.
The prosecutor’s office concluded that Kubatov accounted for 10 percent of the invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the tender for the Biztos Pont association, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k. t.
In January 2006, the associations Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Szövetség and Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted proposals to the public competition of the Mih<0xC3><0xA1>lye T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They earned 500 thousand forints, but they did not spend the amount on the goals stated in the proposals.
To avoid this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a house search in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the progress of invoice production, as they have already done at the prosecutor’s office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised to explain everything extensively several times, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether this is in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, perhaps the socialists made a deal with him and Zusi will take over.
He may have been offended, because his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, that is, to be placed under house arrest, had not yet been heard.
While the perpetrators of economic crimes, who have caused much more damage than they have yet to pay, are free to walk through, or at least wait for, the end of proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have that possibility.
The psychology of trumping: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been discovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at the University of New York.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people do not want to lag behind in an auction like eBay, so they prefer to pay too high a price.
The research, using an experimental auction, tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group took part in a live auction, and using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method, the active areas of the brain of the experimental subjects were examined.
In both games, participants could win money, but when playing at the auction, an important element of which is to beat the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called striatum, began to work intensively when losing.
In addition to many other functions, this brain region plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the screwing of the price can therefore be explained by an effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, members of the research team from among economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
In addition, the members of the next group were promised that if they exit the game winning, they will receive another $ 15 for the reward.
The third group received $ 15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, was that one group was highlighted as a win and the other as a loss.
However, members of the group playing "against defeat" were willing to go higher than they were in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
“These results cannot be inferred from any previously existing economic theory.
Until now, they have explained the phenomena observed at auctions by the joys of winning and avoiding risk.
Until neurological imaging methods helped us resolve the contradiction between the two theories by now reaching a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
Approximately half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is listed as one of the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are being treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a summary name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities in their symptoms, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but the causative agents of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways, depending on the causative agents of the disease: hepatitis A and E by the digestive system (for example, infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
Travellers should in any case protect themselves by vaccination against the virus A and B, there is no vaccine against the virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, urge to vomit.
Then, on the skin and whites of the eyes, jaundice is formed, the stool lightens and darkens the urine. Treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, a million people die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that, according to estimates, only one in ten infected people are treated with medication.
Also, hepatitis C can have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, the causative agent of the disease destroys liver cells insidiously, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases only in 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, carrying out regular depyrstation is very important.
In three groups, the disease is much more common than the average: among people who underwent blood transfusions before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can already prove routine laboratory examination, if a person notices any symptoms of unknown origin, he should contact his doctor.
With early detection, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, preventing contagion and preventing the development of cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, to the causes of its occurrence and to the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, does it not hurt so much?
According to recent research, belief in God acts as a certain analgesic that could have facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how a person's belief in the god of perception of pain affects, the British newspaper The Telegraph reported.
In a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the pain.
Thanks to a technique that examines the human brain in detail, it has also been shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies, which include scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The test was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkling instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which produced electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: Sassoferrato's Virgin Mary from the 17th century and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's cross-stitch painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would elicit a certain state of piety among the faithful, while da Vinci’s image was chosen because it did not differ much from the first one and, according to them, made a calming impression.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during that time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while separately observing an image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said they felt "safe" when they looked at the Virgin Mary, as if they were "taken care of" and "relaxed, filled with peace."
When watching a religious painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strongly impressive image even among atheists, only to find the right photo.
"We would have to find an image that they would perceive very positively, from the position of mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Bishop of England, Tom Wright, welcomed the results.
“Practicing faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality,” Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on regulating the pain of believers if they were shown some Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar caliber.
Would it mean looking at the quality of the Virgin Mary to achieve even better results?
You're what you share with yourself
On his 10th birthday, Google can declare that people can find it in their pockets at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they were on vacation, what they go for professional examinations, and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s CEOs, this is still not enough.
However, as for the skeptics who parallel the Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for the founders of Google to stick to their original intention, which was: “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to the interviewed Google representative, the company, even after ten years of world-class work, is only at the beginning of being able to work with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would be good for me?” – but software won’t be able to answer such seemingly simple questions until they know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are well aware that during an Internet search, the searched words are accurately captured, including from which IP address they were searched and to which pages they moved after the search.
Thanks to the Personalized Search service launched two years ago, users can, for example, keep a history of their surfing, can look back on what they were looking for and what they clicked on, thanks to which in the long term, findings are generated that are adapted much more directly to them - the same logic will be based on the Recommendations service, through which the system will be based on the previously mentioned and stored preferences of the products.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? – ask users who are afraid when looking at Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the extent of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not elicit guilt in Internet users, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all search terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most well-known example in recent times was probably a coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
Internet users who worry about personal rights could still rest in May, however, when the firm successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: Google must not be forced by any article of the Constitution to provide any information to the secretly requested FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully retrieved nearly 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with reference to the strengthening of the adopted child protection law years ago, but failed to obtain lists of individual users’ search items, or complete lists of websites and keywords, covering a period of two months.)
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is being flogged by those who are afraid of providing their personal information because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be harmed by using Google’s services, and they oppose it with a revolt that belongs to multinational companies with a conservative image.
And so far, the American geek culture and its wild branch, grouping enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees him as a new generation of bigots, a "corporation that is running now", unlike his rival Microsoft, which is considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money from them for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information, and the package of programs acts as much more accessible, more youthful, "cool" than the practice of the official software giant.
However, this may also be due to the fact that geeks accurately understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personal rights, which has brought with it one of the most inclined keywords of recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about cooperation, about intentionally leaving footprints and using the communication channels we have available, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show up.
The average young person can maintain a profile on several community sites, from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily connect with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm, recording his music, all this can then connect to navigation systems, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, in addition to which he can write a photo on his blog.
In doing so, we can read about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it shines: a girlfriend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of mutual friends, easily finds out who her scary friend spent the evening with, or the company can fire its employee only because on his blog he completely expresses his sincere opinion about the top management: one thing is certain, after all.
The one who lives online life consists of what he shows himself, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And anyone who wants to hide something or at least avoid Google’s monopoly has the option (starting with Scrooge, who uses Google’s search engine, but deliberately leaves no trace).
For example, a large number of people do not intentionally register on community sites so that they cannot be found. Online applications of Google from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to giant server parks and that do not build the best possible profile of us.
Public opinion is not too secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms are jeopardizing investment by advertising agencies, and services rolled out at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously embarrassing the lives of not only Microsoft but also numerous other software designers.
Critical observers, however, also find counterpoints to the interests of the regime that seem to be disturbing: the top management, for example, completely rejected employee protests after doubled the fee for the company kindergarten, the arbitrary daily ration of employees was too expensive, according to the company management, but all this is lost in addition to the fact that Google bowed before the government in 2006.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services with its own profiles, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can take the world to new places: while some believe that Google's project aimed at scanning and archiving books and magazines acquires such dimensions that the company will soon have to deal with the latest U.S. court.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can then serve as a good starting point for future generations of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow’s famous novel “Scroogled” describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which a person can be intimidatingly well approached only with the help of Google data.
Two young people helped a double murderer from Ozd to remove the traces of two young people
Two young people were interrogated by police in a case of double homicide in Ozd, allegedly helping to remove traces of the crime, a spokesman for Borsod County's High Police Directorate said on Tuesday.
Persons have confessed to the activity of which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding a crime.
Both teenagers, according to MTI, are being prosecuted on the loose.
Assisting a criminal offence is punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect in the double homicide in Ozd, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into provisional custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of a pre-planned multiple homicide for profit.
During the investigation, it was revealed that the 23-year-old young man owed the 53-year-old a larger amount.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to an establishment in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the young man was preparing to commit a crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, the chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, despite the fact that the Czechs had already excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
This is because the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60% of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles represents the highest amount ever offered to the interested parties on the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far submitted bids.
Prague Stock Exchange chief Petr Koblic said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the collapse of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with about 25 percent, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 percent and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European newspapers
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers already recall the "second September 11th".
We can thank the American president for the global financial disaster, accuses the Roman La Repubblica. The president was not even able to arrange his own party in support of that hastily repaid bill aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about the second September 11th.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the world economy has been brought to the brink of collapse by a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is constantly growing, and the whole world will eventually pay for it.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, there is a risk that Washington will not offer a political tool for resolving the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says the Geneva-based Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline at the money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor further improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to move beyond their national egoism and to unite control of fragmented financial markets.
Last Monday alone, stagnant monetary institutions received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, the Vienna-based Der Standard said, adding that fears that, like the Americans, European taxpayers will have to reach deep into their pockets to resolve the crisis are becoming increasingly real.
The European Union has not seriously addressed the crisis, which is like a tsunami rolling down the old continent, until now.
The "rescuers" may not be waving hundreds of billions of euros at once, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to reach for taxpayers' money in order to avoid even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of a bumblebee
What would perhaps be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitation of detectors of obstacles occurring in the natural world?
For example, with bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was inspired by bumblebee engineers from Nissan. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent collisions.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has developed the BR23C type biomimetic robotic control system, a robotic mini-auto that is equipped with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape, which in fact is very similar to our safety protective packaging,” explained Kazuhiro Doi, General Manager of the brand in the field of technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by folded eyes, which allow bees to see in all directions in an angle of view of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the folded eye, the engineers reached for the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles at a distance of up to 2 meters from BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which immediately turns into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is captured within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bee and turning the wheels to the extent necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this shifting manoeuvre takes place in a completely instinctive way.
“If it weren’t for this, the robotic car wouldn’t be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Lab and the robotic car project.
It must respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology meets the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety protective packaging, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
This process should not take longer than a blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be up, down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees during avoidance, only the possibility of rotational movement, acceleration and deceleration was used in the case of a robotic car.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer service life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, an instinctive, intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process, much less to store data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It does not need to store and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only a memory of a few kilobytes.
It does not need memory with gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step towards developing technology for immediate avoidance, which Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced vehicles within 10 years.
Another possibility of application may be the connection of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding road obstacles, would lead the driver to the specified end goal.
Damn dear child already has a name
The $700 billion economic bailout bill, which is to be split into several installments to buy back low-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further talks, which ended on Saturday after midnight U.S. Eastern Time, Congressional representatives reached an agreement in a days-long debate on a $700 billion rescue package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said only a deal remained.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the compromise: "The program will work and will be effective, but further steps need to be taken."
The written version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise in the stock market.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft legal standard hearing the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be set up, followed by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after which news of the deal was also welcomed in the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
The program differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal that the entire sum of $700 billion should be spent on the purchase of low-quality mortgage-backed securities at once.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of half of 700 billion in the first round, so that 250 billion will be used immediately after the matter as expected by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them securities secured by mortgages that are assessed as of poor quality, then the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will depend on the decision of the President.
The program will be supervised by a special corps, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply combined tactics: it can simultaneously buy back low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can take place within the framework of auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the ministry said.
The legal norm will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for the funds presenting a cause for concern, for which the company will then pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the bill provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent demands of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the prevention of systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the major monetary institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
Bank bosses who are in trouble and waiting for the help of the state, on the contrary, can count on the government to reduce their severance pay - which is simply called "golden parachute" in the overseas slang.
Their payments will be limited only in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the type of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the ministry buys as part of the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold parachutes if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of low-quality loans, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the money for management is not exaggerated.
It must be added that the existing contracts on gold parachutes will not change, the restriction applies only to new contracts, which is supposed to be another incentive to participate in the program.
“This is the first time in U.S. history that there will be a legal restriction on the remuneration of CEOs,” said Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.
In addition, the state will have the right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the program, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, because once the economy and the rescued bank stand on its feet, they can make money on this transaction.
In the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress setting out how the expected losses from the financial sector can be reimbursed to taxpayers.
Of course, there were also voices of doubt on both sides regarding the plan.
“That’s not what the American people asked us to do, because that’s not what taxpayer dollars will protect,” Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, said in a statement.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes that it was precisely those who were responsible for the Wall Street collapse that were pressing for the adoption of the provision.
Industrial prices continue to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month in August 2008, compared to 12.9 percent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Export sales prices in the industry were 1.1 percent higher than in July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
Industrial production prices were 0.7% higher as a cause of changes in domestic and export prices compared to the previous month, up 3.2% year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry rose only minimally compared to the previous month, by 0.1 percent.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing industries also increased slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared to July.
The biggest price increase was in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 percent), mainly due to the monthly increase in prices in the bag and saddlery sector by 4.6 percent, and the production of footwear by 2.5 percent, respectively.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 per cent), the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.9 per cent), as well as - to a minimum extent - in the wood-processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9%.
In the production and distribution sector of electricity, gas and water, which has a high weight in domestic sales of the industry, prices increased by 0.3% in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the 12-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metal-working sector, a 13.2 per cent increase in prices was observed, followed by a 11 per cent increase in prices in the food, beverage and tobacco sectors.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile industries (2.5 per cent) and in the electrical machinery and equipment industries (0.3 per cent).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the price growth rate ranged from 0.6 percent to 9.1 percent.
In total, prices in the manufacturing industry increased by 10.2% over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors exceeded the prices of the previous year by 18.7 percent.
In terms of division by sector, domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in the tangible asset production sectors in August.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3%, in the energy and further processing sectors, prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy and further processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods sectors, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while for tangible assets, prices fell by 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, falling by 3.9 percent in the 12-month comparison.
In one month, our domestic currency weakened against the euro by 1.7 percent, against the dollar by 7.1 percent, against the euro by 7.5 percent and against the dollar by 15.9 percent.
Will you be in the United States next year without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is high hope that the U.S.-Hungarian visa-free agreement will come into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "almost everything now depends on the fact that an electronic system for permitting trips, or controls, will be built in time overseas."
At the same time, she pointed out that the new system will not include an entry permit, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The representative of the Hungarian diplomacy from today continues the negotiations in Washington.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Middle Cross with the star of the Order of Merit for the Hungarian Republic, and will hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout package
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major U.S. parties, on Sunday unanimously pledged their support for a $700 billion government bailout package, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After a few-day marathon of negotiations between Congress and administration officials, it was announced early on Sunday morning that a basic agreement had been reached on a bailout package.
The financial package, which aims to melt down the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain agree that they are the most suitable of the two candidates to bring the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, along with how economic issues came to the fore, Obama gained a certain advantage again, and McCain’s advance, which he secured after the Republican convention of nominating Sarah Palin for the post of Vice President, disappeared.
Obama expressed his hope that the $700 billion package bill would be passed quickly by Congress at an election rally in Detroit on Sunday.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly ... to your jobs, your savings, the entire industry, the stability of the entire economy is in danger," he said.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy obsolete.
McCain said in an interview with ABC: "It's going to be a little bit of a resentment... but doing nothing is just not possible."
According to the Republican senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission supervising the Minister of Finance and the restriction of the severance fee for the top officials he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a major role in the negotiations, but that he was in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill on Monday.

The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident – so analyzes the weak CSU result in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiderites are ready to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Up its Fathers" the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to a well-known political scientist, CSU erosion began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades - and it is these modern citizens who are now turning their backs on them.
The alternation of periods is a problem for the entire Christian democracy, and thus for Angela Merkel.
Debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process, which could be assumed for almost exactly ten years, ended: the undisputed hegemony of one state party.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s, below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, in the so often-repeated Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that the CSU has consistently carried out in this country and which is eating up its parents.
However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of opportunities, which also has its visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters inside it have become more confident, more critical, more reckless.
It is also clear that in recent weeks, the CSU has moved away the most from the classical civil strata; people in the free profession, tradesmen, individuals with graduation and higher education.
Thus, CSU support has already shrunk below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? Party presidents are restrained on coalition issues", deals with the confused domestic political situation created as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens are not yet willing to agree on a coalition.
The elections are behind us, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much insight into their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some federal countries and in social partnerships.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice chancellor.
As he said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overvoted for every fall.
Repeating this direction is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offer.
As he said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is completely open in the party so far, these issues need to be discussed definitely within the ÖVP.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"In order to prevent a red-black coalition, we are ready to assume the responsibilities of the government," Haider said.
We need to break the cycle of poverty and segregation.
The European Equality Summit, hosted by France, the current Presidency of the European Union, has started in Paris today.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz Movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The Summit was opened by Xavier Bertrand, the French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, the European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, on behalf of the French Presidency.
Among the invited representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society organisations working in the field of equal opportunities, the negotiations were held.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, the Fidesz J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> movement pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of workers, Romani people are pushed out of the European labour market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, as a result of poor quality of primary education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the application of other human rights.
Investing in early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish the awareness of these connections in the widest circles - among Romani and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Romani student starts school, the greater the chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"It is the right of the Roma to their citizenship of the European Union to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to the MEP, the cohesion of the European Union is necessary, with an emphasis on the objective and action, in order to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools immediately, and, above all, proper compliance with existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations is important.
"It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, it is necessary to give Roma children the opportunity given by the democratic space, so that they can participate as full-fledged citizens in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> demanded.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", everyone is guaranteed the objective of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, to provide a separate forum to help achieve the goals of equality and the elimination of discrimination set out at the level of Europe as a whole and of individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Mercy
The fate of the duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the embarrassing election debacle, the debate on personal issues has so far been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party leader Erwin Huber and country prime minister Günther Beckstein can still stay in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes, will be decided on the last October weekend by the extraordinary congress of the party.
Members of the highly criticized duo, in any case, let themselves be told that they will not cling to their posts with all their strength.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to bring about personal consequences.
Five years ago — true, still under Edmund Stoiber at the top of her career — the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but it only had a 43.4 percent strength.
The CSU has been a self-governing entity in Bavaria, producing 18 percent of Germany’s GDP, for 46 years.
Although the conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, continue to hold a high position, they will be forced into a coalition in the future anyway.
One of the first signs of reorganization within the party is the fact that the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be Huber’s successor, will also be a member of the narrow intelligence team, which will launch a polling session on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or with the right-wing group of Free Voters.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the duo Huber-Beckstein to carry out the coup, entered the House of Commons on the nomination of the Free Voters, but then they made a mercilessly short process with the ambitious municipal politics.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their energy on stabilizing Beckstein.
In the transition period, Stoiber, who has been spinning the strings from the background so far, is also going to play an active role, the former country’s prime minister and former CSU president called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber scrutinized several offensive remarks to the CDU, which he said would have earned much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a significant role in the country's success in 2005, puts together a joint effort.
According to Merkel, who found it difficult to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier, and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD scored 18.6 percent of the weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single opposition member of parliament was elected to the Belarusian parliament on Sunday.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the illegalities that occurred during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the country's 110-member legislature has been lacking opposition for several years, the opposition grouped under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had kept the constitutional change in the 2006 election with a controversial course, would "resume this president's fourth term in office".
The ODS also dropped the previously considered boycott.
Against the backdrop of the opposition’s expectation was that Russia’s increasingly politically dependent Belarus – which, in order to mitigate the impact of Russia’s ever-expanding natural gas imports, took credit and helped Beltransgaz, which owns gas pipelines passing through the country, to get into Russian hands – wished to improve relations with the European Union.
The release had previously pointed out that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, had placed emphasis on positive shifts rather than shortcomings - for example, a ban on a third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE flash report on Monday already had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates could not appear in the press, especially that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, improvements can be felt in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, even if it continues to refuse to recognize the breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a non-union state on paper.
"We have taken two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "she was too afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, it is not planning protests, but rather trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is hampered by local authorities, but I still see that more and more people, even among the elderly, are supporting the change," Milinkovitch said, pointing out that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the creation of social security to be its greatest success, does not consider the right or officially the most supported layer of pensioners.
“Due to the country’s debt and growing trade deficits, it is only a matter of time before the ‘silent graveyard’ of social security collapses,” Milinkevic said.
Unlike opposition politicians, Russian observers regarded the election as democratic.
The head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Sergei Lebedev, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people don't trust words but actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing but evidence of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced on the arrival and departure of employees.
But from now on, this new measure will work against cunning people, against those who inject themselves and then go for coffee during working hours.
The novelty against sloths was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maure Masi.
“The revolving door,” says Brunetta, “is a tool for better work, better performance, more presences and more services.”
“A new era of accountability and transparency will now open.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
The Chigi Palace will complete the establishment of the Presidency of the Council in all buildings.
For Masi, “the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a common approach with the workers and cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, "There's nothing better than a proper cappuccino at seven in the morning."
During one conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months, the absence of public workers for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient.
“Its payout dynamics,” the minister explains, “has doubled over the past 8-10 years relative to the private sector and is far higher than the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees gathered to reject the norms of the Brunett decree in line with a request backed by Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on the lower absence from work due to illness,” writes the Consumer Protection Association, “the nation of ‘urgent sloths’ is constantly growing.
In Italy, we have thousands of productive and honest public servants who have come together to declare war on the illegitimate norms enshrined in the decree.”
In particular, Tara will be protested against the exclusion of sick pay, which depends on the activity; the extension of the time during which the sick person can be checked, within what time frame control visits will be carried out, and against other norms included in the new ministerial provisions.
Work accidents, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 work-related accidents, three people die and twenty-seven remain permanently disabled.
Inail figures confirm that in 2007 there were approximately 1,200 deaths from work-related accidents.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
In order to regain the attention of institutions, social and informational media on this dramatic problem, Anmil today celebrates in all Italian regions the 58th National Day of Victims of Work Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October.
"The alarming data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic reports these days confirm the importance of the issue of occupational safety," President Giorgio Napolitano said in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Disabled and the Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his keen admiration for the continuous joint efforts to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to participate in public opinion.
“Naturally, the outraged ‘enough’ has been raised, frankly shared in the face of the tragedies that, in their scope, cause riot in the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality again offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Of particular importance are the numerous initiatives implemented in the field of education in order to give young people facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up due to its disturbing social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed, "how the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social situation, how it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort towards the necessary end of this state."
“As far as data on work-related accidents are concerned, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to work-related accidents is alarming,” Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli said.
“We would not want this ‘reduction effort’ to lead to less attention, because just when attention stops, tragedy will break out.
“We believe that there is still too little work being done in general to stop the problem of accidents, and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase checks and inspections, but also to make a stronger impact on the training of workers, right from school age."
“There is still a need for further efforts,” he added, “in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents an exceptional social phenomenon is needed.”
In the end, Mercandelli declared that this was a progressive degeneration of the levels of the right to compensation envisaged for labor victims and the “displacement of supportive care” that the system has been getting to in recent years.
“The goal is to return the insurance guarantee to the worker,” he added, “because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on the spontaneity or gifting from time to time by the legislator.”
Mp3 Players Accused of Exposing Hearing to Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a statement published today by the European Commission, which quotes the opinion of the Committee on Science on Health Risks recently emerged and identified (Csrseri) by the EU in an official report circulated in Brussels.
“From this scientific viewpoint,” we read in the notes, “it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable musical instruments for at least five years, more than an hour a week and keep the device at high volumes, risk permanent loss of hearing ability.”
“I am concerned that such a large number of young people, who often use portable musical instruments and mobile phones at high acoustic levels, can unwittingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings,” the leader continues, “there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to encourage consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate the problem, given the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
"Scientists confirm the need to be concerned and now the European Commission, together with other members and parties who have raised the issue, will examine what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is possible to greatly reduce these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the Scientific Committee of the EU states that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, will exceed the currently applicable limits corresponding to the maximum permissible noise in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be estimated between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno to leave the Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today we will start, in March we will close, in June we will have sums.
Such is the calendar given by Campidoglio to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spa.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the Commission will draw up the Rome Handbooks.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemanno.
“The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas,” Alemanno said, “It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbitrators who remain the Giunta e Municipal Council.
This is not about any exchange of functions, but only about trying to have a place to work on a big project for Rome.
In March, the work will be completed and then dissolved, because this institution must have an exact timeline.
In June, the mayor announces, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work done by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome."
To the one who accuses the Commission of being useless because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno will reply: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Commission's Attali proposals, and I am sure of that in Rome, its contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics breaks down on everyday problems and on the urgency that arises from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the Mayor of Rome wants to stress that "this Commission is neither a wasteful undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not cost a euro and will serve to think through and engage the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic blueprint as a starting point, neither definitive nor immovable, in order to allow our city to rise authentically to the level it urgently needs, and to think unitedly about its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome said, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders, but will look much further" not only in the optics of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? First anti-American president. Now we know why
One well-known American president wrote that it was important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as well as today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election comes to an end.
A lady from Miami wrote on the website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama is bold: he thinks he’s going to get to the top of a nation that’s got two governors and five black senators all over it!”
In fact, these attacks don’t say much”; they are attacks of unequivocally racial origin, and they don’t answer the voters’ question: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with a big lead.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a comment: “At least once in the ballot box, we know who the American patriot will vote for.”
There will be one side of the American mentality that has remained swollen until the very last moment.
Say what you want, we'll take care of it ourselves, who to check, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, the black candidate’s success seems almost certain.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, George Bush is the main weapon.
They asked 1,500 people: what mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, the nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home with kicks in the ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers died and the Americans were not forced to pack.
And yet, Iraq has become a weakness for most of the Bush administration.
Whoever takes the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the United States was also felt by journalists: there is an investigation period in the newspapers. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their assumptions about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, respondents did not openly say they had fewer concerns about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the 2008 crisis is a crisis of a ruined economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism, as understood by the general public, to change fundamentally.
American journalists are permeating clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors believe that journalism is going the wrong way nationally.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against the broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
Larger publishers are paving the way for the Internet, which many see as a “killer” of print.
The “economic pressure” that journalists are pointing out has increased by as much as 79%.
Five hundred journalists said they were resorting to technology in the hopes of “doing something good for their journalism.”
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms—that is, leaders—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "work security" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs within three years are at the national level at 47%.
As for journalists, they are moving at 30%.
When it comes to “certain work” regarding staff (our editors, ndr) in America, it is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on the contract.
In a nation as huge as the U.S., with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radios, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, so it’s a matter of taking it or leaving it.
Leaders almost always get huge salaries, and the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month outside of paying pensions and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument becomes more complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, and up to fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own confession, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STILLS IN GROTTAFERRAT
The President of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the application of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counter-offer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial at his own expense, he was released from house arrest last week, which was converted into a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a businessman with real estate could change his place of residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
This phenomenon manifested itself a few days ago, when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a large proportion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis is splitting the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old soul East Coast, more moderate, friendly to the federal institutions and to the business community, and its new soul, which, on the contrary, is conservative, hostile to "the forces of Washington" and the world.
A soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote I spoke of at the beginning.
But this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the U.S. and in Europe, this crisis seems to act as an accelerator of phenomena that have been incubated for a long time, that are solidifying in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the double category of the Power-State in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which, of course, have strong bonds abroad, but in which, above all, the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, are mostly included.
This has also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families, who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be essentially out of the question or that it has nothing much to add: the obvious proof has been given by the European Union, which is divided, as always, between different interests and different state strategies, and which cannot decide on a single political line.
And so everyone is waiting for the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, the recovery of the market, new rules and, above all, the distribution of funds: at the moment when we are in distress, only the states have economic resources, the amount of financial resources to be able to try to put everything in order.
And they also possess the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immeasurable value, under certain circumstances, which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to possess to the same extent.
This new emphases, which the crisis places on the state-national element, is, moreover, in full accord with the ever-increasing importance which attempts to attribute the latest economic advances to one factor closely linked to it: territorial affiliation.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of grid, increasingly sophisticated technology, immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to deal more and more with such little intangible things as water, oil, grain.
All things, who would have said it, can be transported from one place on the earth to another, but they are in any case connected, absolutely, to a bounded space, territory.
So, whoever becomes their ruler certainly has a lot more cards in his sleeve than who is not and who has the bad luck of living in a place without grain, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novel, which, however, predicts a break.
He who speaks of territory, of the state, of government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Taking into account the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a request for someone who can grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit towards existing leadership, especially economic leadership, which has proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark spots.
And together, something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incapacity and absence that is trying to dominate the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries.
In fact, it seems that there is a growing belief among the masses of the population that their actions should be the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already surpassed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership from the right may feed one branch of the underground, but the strong movement for the abolition of the ruling classes and the traditional political order of Italy is manifested in the sudden electoral "rebellions" or in the unexpected changes in collective moods in recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the conservative rise of the Bavarians to the Bavarians.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, one would say their format, are increasingly having trouble understanding, that is, representing, which, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening again, is growing, is potentially over-cooling.
Before that, it would be exaggerated to speak of a permanent “mass rebellion.”
But we can’t say that it means having your eyes open.
Super glue for walking on walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now the team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists managed to keep the stokilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters.
STUDIUM – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, which was invented by a team of researchers, is the development of materials that already exist, which use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The basis of the adhesive can be imagined as a series of pipes laid out like an ordered pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by gecko legs covered in microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests performed on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the feet of these reptiles, and at the same time "it simply peels off the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton School of Engineering.
-"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps, but researchers are thinking about a far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon pipes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
So far, no superheroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists introduced a glue formed from microfibers as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving across the surface to maintain perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medicines, their ingestion changes the gain or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of juices, both ready-made and fresh, combined with the ingestion of certain drugs, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he is raising a new alarm: just one glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice for life.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
MEDICINES AT RISK – The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in an information bulletin two years ago, exasperating doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department at the State University of Milan, said: “Such findings are usually immediately reported to various international and national pharmacy agencies, which will eventually arrange and exchange informational instructions for medicines.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the drugs you get, and if you come across something unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification.”
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Yorker who teaches at the University of Priceton and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic, and political actions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron was bankrupt, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of implications for the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
A prediction that caused a lot of controversy, and which he was reproached for years, but which proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at the speed at which collapses such as Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public interest,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Central European Bank’s Executive Committee, Krugman is an “econom of great importance” but also a popularizer who has a “very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush Liberalist administration.”
Open Office, we have the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft»
It’s Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personal production package that aims to infiltrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by the SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various novelties: the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window will be added to other, much more essential, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on working with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document even with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models, such as what allows you to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF folder to a graphical model and preserve the original appearance of the page.
From this point of view, we can still create "PDF hybrids" documents that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the features of a spreadsheet or text program.
Cooperation is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel, it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in a text program, each co-worker is assigned one color for comments to be more clearly identified in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to transfer some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should remake the definitive result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
Also, the installation CD can be sent home or to the workplace on request.
And if the topic of freeness can be a tactic to expand in households, it is the Open Office business area that the package bets a lot, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there are also offers of training, consultation and assistance services ideal for small and medium-sized businesses, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video typing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, in the end, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and if we consider that today we are almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of the new version, it is possible that this estimated number can even be exceeded.
Also, Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth case of doping
A new positive case at the last Tour de France: this is Austrian Bernhard Kohl, from Gerolsteiner, the third-ranked and winner of the best mountaineer t-shirt.
The report was quoted by the L'Equipe newspaper.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer positive on Cer, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepola and the German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
The results of Kohl's blood samples are among those that have been performed in recent weeks by Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms the positivity on Cer, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and will have to face the prescribed two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positive outlook for the third-generation Epo is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who announced to the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities about the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and also won the pointy T-shirt of the best mountaineer.
IMGRANTS: NEW YORK TIMES IS ITALY RASISTIC?
Italy "as a country of emigrants only in the last house has turned into a priority target of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
It turns a beautiful country into a nation of racists? So asked in a long article by the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, and began with the case of a young Abdul William Guibra originally from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
The case highlights what the New York Times defines as the “paradox of the north”: the northern areas are at the same time those where “more integration and more work” is registered, but also “the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League”.
To confirm the rising tensions between Italians and immigrants, the NYT cited cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just that.
Also, the new legislation required by Legou, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of a changing climate in Italy.
The tendency highlighted by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting with Benedetto XVI in Quirinale, asked that the state and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to recent research by Sunia, the unions for tenants, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
“The phenomenon has already reached such proportions that entire layers of students have lost the right to study because of the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear,” explains Laura Mariani, head of Sunia’s studios, “in this city, the high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has spurred a process of price hikes that has spread to residents.”
In most cases, rental offers contain several misdemeanors: contracts in a free manner, unregistered, without limited rent, and the associated subleases.
An exceptional intervention is needed for Sunji, which could regulate prices through a tax revision.
If you look at the details of the research, you will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, you need about 450 euros for one bed, for a single room you pay from the minimum price of 650 (Bande Nere zone) to the average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in zones near the university, 250/280 euros are required for a bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome, in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double room.
The values are slightly lower (550 euros per single) in zones near other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We will save only if we move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are needed for a bed, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where the most common rental phenomenon is for students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally recorded: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italian ones.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls are closing in favor of Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is like a blind, like a face without eyes."
The painting, offered by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the big Italian city centers, as well as in rural towns.
The process of limiting cinemas, the birth of large multi-rooms in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of mono-rooms in the central zones of cities is one of the events that seem inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a real cultural crime.
"It's as if we lost a friend, a friend, with whom we shared a bit of a journey and a lot of emotions," feels the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won Tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize in Cannes twenty years ago, and which told the poems of a lifetime.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, 316 traditional-style cinemas have closed their doors, and the highest bills were paid mainly by the halls in the most important cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna came first with a loss of 82 cinema halls, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinema multi-sales: 195 more canvases in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian procedure has developed irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anecu, “it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Then let's not even talk about the lack of subsidy to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous government debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
Between 16 million and 18 million euros per year would be needed to support the sector.”
Interesting is the Bologna case, the first Italian city to worry about closures and decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas in both historic centers and suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief for operators and benefits for the audience in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the restricted transport zone and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand up to the great power of the multiplex, traditional halls need to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to start the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and as I walk in front of the already closed Rialto or Quirinal in Nazionale Street, where I shared so much emotion that I didn’t have to look at the blackened dust inscriptions, I turn to the other side.”
Connection between politics and the 'ndrangheta mafia group, Mayor Gioia Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges brought by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Vice Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione e Rosari Schiavone and Mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
Also in handcuffs are Gioacchino Piromalli, an old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the name of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
“They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense,” prosecutors wrote, when two local authorities expressed their willingness to pay for the consultation to a lawyer, Piromalli.
“This would allow the mafia group to officially enter city offices and make it easier for them to control and manage public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional commission, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are a lot of secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still immaculate.'
The incarceration from this morning follows a July incarceration last year by which police showed that the Piromalli mob group had received a final hit.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioii Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was also the then supposed link between organized crime and local administration - local politicians were deprived of their functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a narrow election in May.
He shouted about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of having designed everything for political reasons, but the judges in the incarceration decree signed this morning explain that the mafia group even went so far as to ask for a change to the A3 motorway project.
Other interrogations ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutors wrote, showed "a willingness to shift the claims of an entrepreneur, a representative of a larger group very close to, as is commonly known, Piromalli, and to adapt the public administration choices to the interests of the mafia group."
When energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It is an endless deposit that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, tides are the new sources of inexhaustible energy upon which the gaze of colossians like Chevron, who is now trying to reach out to these sources, has clung.
The possibility of generating energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in connection with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went away, but now environmental organizations and a new rise in the price of oil gave the sector a new impetus.
In 2007, the World Energy Council (WEC) in London stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of sea wave movements.
That would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides.
Giants are attacking.
The company that relied on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it seemed to be a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, there are more and more companies betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company that is linked to the United States oil colossus told the Wall Street Journal, “and they’re thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation we are considering concerns obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of a project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
This signal cannot be underestimated, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and President Bush has recently come up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, show growing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to cause major ecosystem problems.
For greater energy production, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fears that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of cylinders and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure turns the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
Energy is brought to shore by submarine cables.
So far, there are four facilities of this type in the project phase, which are waiting only for federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping mall and parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the inflow and outflow causes the turbines to rotate, which feed the generator with this rotational movement.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
Special interest at this point deserves the potential of the tide and outflow, say the Institute for Research on Electricity.
Although it is an incoherent factor, tides are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
States such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in energy in 2008 and predicted investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
