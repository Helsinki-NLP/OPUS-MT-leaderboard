Named the number of preparing to send to the Donbass recruits from Ukraine
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Lugansk People’s Republic (LPR), Andrei Marochko, said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send at least 3,000 new recruits to the Donbass.
According to him, in this way, Kiev plans to “at least somehow complete the units”.
"The reluctance of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass layoffs led to low staffing of units," Marochko said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the real numbers of Ukrainians drafted into the army can be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the Joint Forces Operation (JFO).
It was assumed that this measure will lead to the strengthening of the role of the Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case, several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by the Ukrainian special services.

The head of the British foreign Ministry compared the EU with the Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states of the community.
This statement was made by the diplomat at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As noted by the Daily Mail, Hunt thus commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union did not allow anyone to leave it.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only exacerbate the crisis, notes Gazeta.ru.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit talks were at a standstill.
She commented on the results of the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is expected to take place before April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by many factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The issue of the Irish border is also open.

iPhone users complained about problems in the work of the messenger Telegram after the update, released on September 28.
The user's phone number can be identified by his username
Complaints concern gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the application shows a white screen or immediately closes.
Representatives of the messenger reacted to the failure.

Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updating of the application until troubleshooting.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow granted the claim of Roskomnadzor on the blocking of the Telegram messenger in Russia.

In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user upon receiving a relevant court decision.
The audience of Telegram after the blocking in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

Elon Musk is forced to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over the fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, as part of the agreements, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
At the same time, the commission allowed Musk to retain the post of head of Tesla.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
A similar amount will be collected from Tesla.
The money will be distributed among the affected investors.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, included in the list of the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of space corporation SpaceX, neurotechnical company Neuralink and the developer of electric cars Tesla, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share was reportedly set “because of the importance of this number in marijuana culture,” Bloomberg reported earlier, citing co-director of the commission’s security department, Stephen Pekin.
Elon Musk later abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said that he considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
“Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I did not violate it in any way,” the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
At the same time, in August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a collective lawsuit against Musk, complaining about the financial losses suffered.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman’s posts brought them losses.
In particular, one of the shareholders said that the businessman's tweets were misleading, which forced sellers of Tesla shares to buy papers at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also noted that the reckless statements of Elon Musk led to sharp fluctuations in the course.
In September, Elon Musk was accused of stock exchange fraud and the head of the research company Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Musk had not been able to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have been threatened with dismissal and even imprisonment.
This, in particular, said CNBC, the former chairman of the commission Harvey Pitt.
Musk is a “good guy who doesn’t know how to run a car company.”

The Russian Orthodox Church compared the possible renaming of the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations of the Moscow Patriarchate Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, possible ecclesiastical schism and its political subtext
According to him, now that “the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in an acute stage,” renaming the church is like fascist Germany “to give the Jews a yellow six-pointed star.”
"This means to mark the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the representative of the Russian Orthodox Church said on the Rossiya 24 TV channel.
The Metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because “the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country.”
UOC urged the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: sold out, Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Over the next ten years, Russia may have its own racing car.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Kozak said this, summing up the results of the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
Also, the Deputy Prime Minister shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with automakers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of a Russian car "Formula 1", which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our automakers in this direction.
We were talking about plans until 2024, but I do not think that this is possible at such a time.
I think it will be more realistic in the next 10 years.”
From 2012 to 2014 in the "Formula 1" under the Russian license was the team "Marusya".
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship in motor racing in the "Formula 1" class.
I know that there are car sports fans in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team,” he said.
“We are ready to support them morally.
Let’s hope we have such a team.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, among other things, because such infrastructure appeared in Sochi.”
Tomorrow, the Sochi Autodrome will be sold out.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even the qualifications of the stands were almost filled, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.
I can say that revenue this year increased by 72% compared to last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of the Sochi Avtodrom infrastructure throughout the year.
This will be an additional tourist product that will give even more attractiveness to Sochi.
Did not bypass Dmitry Kozak and the main theme of the day for Russian motorsport enthusiasts - the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso.
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to Izvestia.
He is a very hopeful racer.
Next year, for the first time in the history of the Formula 1 peloton, two major Russian pilots will be able to take part.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirotkin in the "Royal Races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams ends at the end of the season, and the results are not impressive: he took 18th place in the qualification of the Grand Prix of Russia.
Hopefully, next season our main pilots will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming came to the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: “To defeat fascism and liberate France, he did more than dozens of divisions.”
According to experts, Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died of a heart attack at his home in London in 1955.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
Where, by the way, my wife and I drew attention to this by a word-loving Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to see in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the bullfighting of the Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, in my opinion, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not at all about this.

From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK almost fell in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald Trump noted a good joke about his successes on the front of the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, now the leaders of the two countries have improved relations so much that they are almost in love with each other, the American president said.
The White House chief said he had accepted the North Korean issue from the previous administration as a major foreign policy challenge.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even reach the country's leadership - there simply did not take off the phone.
At the time, the United States and North Korea were on the brink of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, he was also “brutal” to Kim Jong Un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders “in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, as well as shutting down military training grounds.
All these are the merits of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump flattered Kim Jong-un from the podium of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

At the same time, other practical steps towards the denuclearization of North Korea are still being taken.
The media reported that after the Singapore summit, the United States had already sent several disarmament scenarios to the DPRK, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them "gangster".

Nice called to oust “Moscow language Ukrainian product”
Ukrainian children’s writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for the expulsion of the “Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language” from Ukraine.
To do this, she proposes a Ukrainian product - a "cultural wave, a cultural onslaught".
She shared her thoughts on “the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine” with the Ukrainian edition of “Observer”.
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is currently being prepared - it already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier Russian speech was widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it almost did not remain.
At the same time, according to Nice, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only an extension of the boundaries for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level.
Previously, Nice shared the experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-language regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue Watsons, a bookstore chain whose cashier spoke to her in Russian.
Not having achieved her goal, Nizoy threw a hand at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians “language schizophrenia”, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Nice recently said that the name “Russia” was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The anger of the writer could not escape even the Security Service of Ukraine: coming there and hearing the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking on the door.

“Such a difficult game turned out, in a break held a serious male conversation, and it brought its fruits: scored two goals and did not miss.
“You missed a few matches because of the damage you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
“If you’ve been there for 90 minutes, that’s fine.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end of the day, a little shore of strength so that nothing happens.
And so, the doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev led me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
“What about the atmosphere on the team?”
“It’s no secret that after winning and recovering is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and please the fans.”
"Have you missed the game since you didn't go out on the field?"
"There is one thing, a little bit missed, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thank you to the physiotherapist and the doctors for getting back on your feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

In the referendum in Macedonia recorded violations
Four incidents related to violations of electoral law were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in a referendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece on renaming.
This was announced on Sunday by the press Secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Tony Angelovsky.
Since the opening of polling stations, four incidents have been recorded, which have been eliminated, he said.

The Ministry noted that all violations are being checked.
“The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can safely exercise the constitutional right to freely express their will.
We call on citizens to comply with the laws and refrain from any violations of public order and tranquility and any violation of the secrecy of voting,” the Interior Ministry spokesman said.
Citizens are invited to answer one question during the referendum on Sunday: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year-old dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17, during a solemn ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which passes the border between the two countries, signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".

Vu<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> said that he did not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve peace.
We will add that according to the information of the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier, it became known that the Serbian president had brought the state army into full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
It is about the events of last Friday, when several dozen special forces of Kosovo entered the territory, which is adjacent to the lake, supplying water hydroelectric power plant "Gazivode".
It is specified that this hydroelectric power plant is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time it belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia ten years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize this fact.
In the spring of last year, the parties stopped negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia was almost absent in a negative way
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia has now been much more muted,” the senator said in an interview published Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in previous years, the Russian Federation was sometimes “designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, at least in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which spoke unanimously on this issue.”
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia was practically absent in a negative way."
“If we carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least, the choir was not quite accurate,” the politician noted, noting that Russia “was no longer some kind of wall, which is trained by the tennis ball”.
The head of the profile committee of the Soviet Federation does not exclude that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two, in three."
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sense can be a turning point," Kosachev admitted, explaining that "too many examples of how with Russia's integration it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine yet, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he added.
This is due to the fact that he believes that there is an "adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of our time".
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are somewhere passing a point where the movement will no longer be a backward movement, it will be a forward movement,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.”
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large part, no one was interested, the situation is different.
According to him, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve the world’s problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration.”
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said, stressing that he believes in this sense "this session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus declares its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that in the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Walid Muallem.
According to him, Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of the withdrawal of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports RIA Novosti.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case of the Kurds’ desire for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF forces were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create by October 15 a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government forces in the Syrian province of Idlib.
Terry leads Chelsea youth team
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating the transition to the Moscow "Spartacus".
According to RT with reference to the Mirror, the former captain of the England team John Terry led the youth team "Chelsea".
According to the source, the famous player, who has long been a part of the London club, will lead the team not older than 23 years.

First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the convicted in the Russian Federation for the “espionage” of the Ukrainian journalist Roman Sushchenko for the fact that he has not yet been able to free from the prisons.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of the illegal arrest of Sushchenko by the FSB.
According to her, these days, under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris, an action is taking place, the participants of which announced a hunger protest demanding the release of Kremlin prisoners.
Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, among them there are people who know you well, starving to support Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is no international meeting, no negotiations, no interview, where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Kr.
She also expressed confidence that the tests will harden every Ukrainian, making us "worse, tougher in protecting the national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil."
Ukrinform correspondent in France Roman Sushchenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 at the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage at the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict-regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legitimate.
The Russian prison guards met the last request of the Ukrainian before he was sent to the colony.

The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he lives only because of his wife.

State Duma MP urged to tell schoolchildren about the dangers of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Based on the experience of his work, he noted in an interview that teenagers to masturbation provokes harmful information, which they find on the Internet.
Fighting this is at the level of educational institutions and the family, the deputy added.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of children, this should be done, explaining the harm, because there is a risk determined to the sexual health of the child, both boy and girl.
The problem is objective, it consists in the fact that the maturation of children comes early enough, and then there are large scissors between their puberty and the opportunity to officially enter into intersex contacts.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by the “chandom”, the silence of the “problems of sexual age” and the lack of a culture of adequate education of children.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers face onanism.
The MP believes that practicing lessons on the dangers of masturbation is primarily in schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.
“If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we just won’t be understood, to put it mildly,” he said.

The AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” is breaking another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, the inhabitants of Germany began to get seriously tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country has become a desirable target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The latest polls show that the anti-immigrant party Alternative for Germany is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, climbing to the second place in the ranking of popular sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one percentage point gap can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is impossible not to mention the fact that the AfD, created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists, managed to turn into a serious political force.
The CSU/CDU ruling bloc, which has about 30 per cent, continues to hold the lead in the overall standings.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who heads the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
The Social Democrats were followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The Evolution of "Alternatives"
The Alternative for Germany party was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s policy, but at first it dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany’s “sponsorship” of the weak economies of the EU, did not exclude the possibility of returning to the German mark and the country’s complete withdrawal from the European Union.
Against the backdrop of the deepening immigration crisis, the AfD’s political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party, which occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of “Alternatives for Germany” received seats in the European Parliament.
A video of a journalist who called the citizens of Ukraine a “nation of fools”
The presenter of the political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov on live television admitted that he considers his compatriots “nation of fools”.
They believe in television and read very little.
As noted by Drozdov, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been taught a culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to fight with literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of the apocalypse - the magazine behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is already accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
Armored Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by video game manufacturers, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche for themselves is being mastered by car companies.
So, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its Apocalypse armor Senator APC.
In the free from fantasies, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, which without much comfort, but in complete safety are placed in a full-welded armored capsule.
This bunker, and otherwise the design can not be called, since the level of its reservation corresponds to the standard B7, is installed on the chassis of a powerful pickup truck Ford Super Duty.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from explosions by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
Salon of the Apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
In order not to harm passengers even an explosive wave from a projectile that exploded near the car, the car interior is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.

There is no chance of getting stuck in the Roshel Senator APC.
You can see the Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse armor at a specialized exhibition in Washington, which will be held in October.
The Death of the Universe
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The research of the international team of scientists is placed in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is aimed at publishing in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun reports.
The researchers came to similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Supreme-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
After tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, the scientists, working within the framework of the standard cosmological model <0xCE><0x9B>CDM (<0xCE><0x9B> Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned out to be a little slower than previously thought.
In a press release, the Subaru Observatory noted that the observations made it possible to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the accounting of data of the European space telescope Planck clarified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of <0xCE><0x9B>CDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments in favor of the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Break.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people on pension reform is postponed for an indefinite period
A meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age was held in Moscow on Saturday.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups that registered different wordings of the issues (in total, the Central Election Commission registered five wordings).
They decided to apply to the CEC for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor that the age established by the legislation on pensions as of July 1, 2018, at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension, is not increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legal.
The majority of the participants in the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist Party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and the consent to come was expressed by representatives of about 40 subgroups.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" Turbine's mistakes fell like from the horn of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the arbitrator Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Locomotive" - "Akhmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeship of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this arbitrator has confirmed his unfitness to referee matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the efforts in the meeting of the fifth round of "Spartak" - "Dynamo", neither Turbine himself, nor the leaders of the DSI have made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow down to affect the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private omissions of rough techniques fell like from the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder falls with his hands in his penalty area defender "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbine does not put a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode featuring Idov, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I think there was a deliberate play by the defender's hand in his penalty area.
The turbine was right next to the moment, it can see this episode and its first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen and reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three fell asleep and no penalty was given.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the case when the refereeing by concept supplanted and buried the sports spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Kryhovyak, and when the judge showed him the yellow card, demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Had to show the second "mustard"?
- At this point, Turbine and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of refereeing that some teams put penalties for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and some do not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to him.
So, the arbiter does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the referee is watching who is playing.
Here played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" has serious complaints about the work of Turbine, because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played the accused of rape judge Kavanaugh at the start of the SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate previously drew attention to his emotionality and detailing of his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly confessed his love of beer, but said that he never drank to the point of forgetfulness.
In addition, in an attempt to justify himself on charges of rape, Kavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin in those years.
These moments were also beaten by Damon.
I was just doing a lot of drinking and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everyone knows this,” said Matt Damon, a judge.
Kavanaugh was previously elected as the Supreme Court Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found in her cloned dogs strange behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behaved completely differently than the original pet.
"They don't look like each other.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul,” the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog of the breed of coton de tolear named Samantha, which had to be put to sleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was reported that a chihuahua dog named Miracle Milly, which was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The U.S. thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
The U.S. could begin a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so eager to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main energy suppliers.
About the possibility of a naval blockade on the eve of told the head of the US interior Ministry Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the U.S. Department of the Interior performs not police but civilian functions, including implementing natural resource policies.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement was fully within the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political coloring.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. naval forces, they control the sea routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be related to Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s revitalization in this region, Zinke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to push back Russia and Iran, and a maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along the way, Zinke said.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
There is a club in Russia that I follow.
Former captain of "Chelsea" and England team John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartacus" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
“I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I’ve been following him recently and it was interesting to see him from the outside.
“I can’t say that I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize again for the decision,” Terry said.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the standings, and "Spartak" was placed on the fifth place, having 15 points in the asset.

Expensive violin handed over to pawnshop for priceless
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, a pawnshop worker offered only $50 for an old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an ancient and expensive tool, and sought the advice of an expert.
It turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at $250,000.
Only the bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was not so long ago stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the tool was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the person who handed it over to the pawnshop, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, an exciting confrontation awaits us: Spartak will host Rostov at its stadium in Tushin under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, not at all alien to the "people's team".
Particularly piquant to this meeting is the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, falling behind the far jumping "Zenith" and being in one point from "Krasnodar", who tomorrow plays with "Dynamo".
The red and whites now have a difficult track: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew "Rapid", and recently lost home to "Ahmat".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat in the Cup "Chernomorets", and it is too early to say whether the most popular club in Russia has come close to getting out of the crisis.
"Rostov" three games in a row could not win, but and defeats do not know already five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend the win-win series with such a principled match for himself.
The previous meeting of the Karpinsky "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
Starts at 7:00 p.m.

London has sparked accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, British Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are increasing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, enemies are acting in gray areas with the help of cyberattacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of these is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia will have to pay a high price if it does not adhere to international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year, former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage in favor of Britain, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia holds a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the country’s name.
The referendum is meant to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the country’s name, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fervent supporter of the renaming of the republic into North Macedonia, was one of the first to vote.
The preparations for the referendum and today’s vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Bureau of Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of the observers was organized:
Approximately 100 teams traveled across the country to watch the entire process today, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.

Faye Dulgheri: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the vote.
The observer groups shall record in detail what is happening and communicate with the members of the election commissions, and then set them out in the final report.
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a large role for mutual understanding.
This on the International Day of the Translator, September 30, told professional translator-synchronist Barbel Saxe.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
“The Germans like to plan events calmly, and the Russians, as the saying goes, “have a long time to buckle up, and go quickly.”
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role," the expert said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that the two countries can not do without each other, "it is enough to know history."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no sense in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "establish relations" with Russia and maintain them.
According to her, for Berlin, mania is especially important the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany on the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Valery Belov: God Helped Siberia Today
The head coach of "Vityaz" Valery Belov - about the defeat of "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"The colleague spoke about the fans of "Siberia", and I want to note our fans," - Belov quotes the official website of "Vityaz".
"I hope they will support it as well, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game, perhaps, God helped Siberia today, because they were very rudely mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, we lost the micro - match 0:3 our leading leaders, so it was difficult for us to pull this match, although there were moments.
However, I will still take the blame.
Because, apparently, we missed something in preparation.
Compared to the last game, it was a different team.”
"It's an ugly nephew."
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Spectators of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "indecent nepotism and brazen shaming".
When in blind auditions he first heard the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not return to the performer.
But sonly feelings prevailed, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor objectivity in the first stage.
But the "joke" lasted, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is no longer ready to forgive Agutina such injustice.
Yesterday we, the spectators of the show, were indignant with the naughty and frank dragging of their close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end to the very first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina reasoned in the program "Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father Leonid Agutin "leaked" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by what the audience still want to see in his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience want an objective assessment and see in the finals really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the members of the "Voice" from the Agutin team - they were doomed."
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loved his dad, and today he had to show himself to be a professional.”
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing and whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
“I like the way my dad sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people will come to this concert.”
It's the Voice show, not the Cool Relatives show.
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part."
"Then we should offer our own show to the pope, not a show that is made for the money of Channel One."
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make me understand more than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut drained with a magnificent voice and timbre, and Agutin’s father brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on and off the stage for decades!
Because you can’t get through the slumber!”
"What were you waiting for?
It's Russia!
All around mud and nephewhood.
And money in the family budget will not be superfluous!
The theatre of the absurd continues!"
Users also recalled that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind auditions came out the son of Gradsky.
Then a meter did not come to mind to take his son into his own team.
In fact, he said, "Come on, get out of here, it's all clear."
Agutin was unable to act as a professional.

The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the moon.
According to him, now the scientific community is engaged in the development of directions of such works.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference, the source of which is the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed for the study of cosmic sources of radio emission," Petrukovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used to test robotics, use local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organics on the Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation "Roscosmos" said that in an optimistic version of the Russian Federation can carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.
An offended customer threw out a basket of feces in the store 7-Eleven
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, said he had a tooth on the manager of a 24-hour 7-Eleven store: in May, he put him out of the store for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to avenge his enemy in an original way.
In the middle of the second night, he went into the store and dumped the contents of the basket he had brought on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
In the basket were faeces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" from a nearby mobile biotoilet.
Arrived at the scene of the incident, the police arrested the "avenger".
He was jailed and released on bail of $300.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone else's property and a criminal offense, and was also prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.
Although Simms’s crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the court sentence can be quite severe, as he has repeatedly violated the law: behind him are large-scale theft, robbery, illegal possession of weapons, driving a drunken car and cruel treatment of animals.

This was stated by the US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the US city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that for the Russian economy the only source of income is the sale of energy, and Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe.

Sergey Sirotkin: I could not do anything, and it was very painful
Russian pilot of "Williams" Sergey Sirotkin commented on the result of the race Grand Prix of Russia.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I found myself between two cars that immediately clamped me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, momentarily, immediately.
I found myself in a very bad position.
He's stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the others hit the pit stop, we would get into the “clean air”, and the pace would return, but the rubber was gone.
Plus he fought with his partner, he also had contact with him.
I understand he was a little mistaken.
We were in this situation on the most impassable track of the season, I could not do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore," Sirotkin quoted RIA Novosti as saying.
Recall that Sirotkin in the race at the Grand Prix of Russia finished 18th, the winner was the British pilot "Mercedes" Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpisev called absurd the removal of Glushakov and Shchenko from the basis of "Spartacus"
The President of the Federation of tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of the players of Moscow "Spartacus" Denis Glushakov and Andrei Shchenko from training with the main line-up after he liked the criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera's actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is unworldly stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the division in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them any way you want.
I wouldn't have reacted to that if I were Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Secondly, everyone wants to get sick.
If Glushakov and Shchetenko like, it does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to perceive the situation.
And it doesn’t serve a normal climate in the team.
Today Spartak does not have a game, so this situation did not need to be inflated at all.
Maybe we should have laughed about it together.
“Spartacus” a lot is not in order in different lines, there is indifference after the introduction into the composition of the youth.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match”, – said Tarpishchev.
The match of the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously refused Spartak, was the head of the Chelsea youth team.
"Sirius" pupils discussed with scientists natural-like technologies
Pupils of the Sirius Educational Center in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended the lecture of scientists of the national research center Kurchatov Institute.
The speech of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Environmentally Friendly Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary “Kody Kurchatov”, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as a driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist was published on the website of "Sirius".
The students learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy to produce such volumes is not yet able.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, natural-like technologies, on which young scientists are working today, will help.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural-like technologies, as well as spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
“The advent of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal good.
It is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is the other side.
The development of natural-like technologies is in fact a technological reproduction of systems of living nature.
There is a reversible side - a purposeful intervention in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
Cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction”, – quotes the scientist REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-natural-like technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Diakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBICS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Educational Center in Sochi was created by the Talent and Success Educational Foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The purpose of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cyber Challenges" will be sent to training in "Sirius".

Kemerovchan infuriated herd of rams in the cemetery
On September 30, on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries freely walk horned animals.
The animals ran a large herd between the fences and plucked the grass.
Commentators expressed different views: some of the local residents noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle at the cemetery, and their appetite can even help in clearing the territory of weeds and grass sprouts, but some of the residents of the city did not like the behavior of animals:
"These are graves, not pastures.
There's nothing for the rams to do there.
Of course, you can not say about the rams that they blaspheme, but still this is not the case." (style preserved) - said in her message an outraged Kemerovskaya.
One way or another, one of the witnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and soon the necessary measures will be taken.
Pushing and pulling – how right?
The word pressure does not exist.
That's right, enough.
The word "pressure" in the meaning of "weighting, exerting, exerting" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "sufficient".
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word “pressure.”
But "pressure" and "sufficient" etymologically are not only not close, but even in some sense opposite.
See for yourself.
Sufficient (Church-book, obsolete) - means "sufficient, complete, sufficient, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Satisfying, pleasure is related words.
Previously, it had the meaning of "to depend on nothing, to have a self-sufficient meaning" - "to be self-sufficient."
The Old Slavic "dovl<0xC4><0xA3>ti" is related to the words "command" and "will".
Suppressing and suppressing are completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (throwing sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaid<0xC4><0xAB> - "to trouble".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "sufficient", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d" that is used by "a" in the letter, which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
That's right, it's enough.
But this word is obsolete, in its correct meaning it is no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstance/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “push”.
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that it is a stationery.

Numerous migrant communities and anti-racism organizations have sent an open letter to the Minister demanding his resignation.
With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100,000 terrorists were killed, of which 85,000 terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was said in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the VKS, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of means of destruction from the air: the air and space forces have inflicted and continue to inflict all strikes exactly on the targets of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, for three years in Syria destroyed tens of thousands of objects of terrorists - we are talking, for example, about ammunition depots, fortified areas and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this became a decisive contribution to the promotion of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Dzhebhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of ISIS.
And we are only talking about registered persons, not counting those who have not been identified, Bondarev said.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any time, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory of our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on the distant borders - otherwise this evil "would have flowed to us".

Syria accuses U.S. of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These murders under international law are war crimes,” he said.
According to Muallem, the United States and its partners provided “direct support to terrorists” as the militants and the Western coalition’s goals in Syria coincided and meant “the sowing of chaos, death and destruction in their path.”
The foreign minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria has almost been completed, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and priority in the reconstruction of the country will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of Warring Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. denied all the accusations.
President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on Hungary’s issuance of its passports in Transcarpathia.
By defending Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he will protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are in the east or the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the country’s consul from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that is said by the Foreign Ministry," the President said.
As reported by "FACTS", on September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuance of Ukrainian citizens at the Hungarian consulate in Berehove of Hungarian passports.
They swore an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
The Minister of foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavlo Klimkin noted that the Consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Ukrainians of Hungarian passports, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the prosecutor’s office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the issue of passports to Hungary.
The incident is qualified under the article "State treason".
Putin Secretly Arrives in Siberia
It is known that the last two days Vladimir Putin spent in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the CIS Council, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian “board No. 1” on the Flightradar website indicate that about 6 pm Tajik time on September 28 Il-96<0xE2><0x88><0x92>300 took off from Dushanbe airport and took a course to the northeast.
In the area of Lake Balkhash, the transponder of the aircraft was turned off.
The direction of his flight indicates that the liner could have flown to Khakassia.
According to the Baikal24 news agency, the president was personally met in Abakan on the night of September 29 by the head of the region, Viktor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the sources of the site believe that the real reason is the “problem of the second round”.
Next Sunday in Khakassia will be held the second round of elections of the head of the region.
It was attended by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Victor Zimin (United Russia).
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin ("Fair Russia") should take part in the upcoming tour together with Konovalov.
Khakassian media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new head of the republic, as well as make a decision on the fate of Zimin.
Putin had already visited Khakassia in January of this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president’s favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict that has been going on in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, primarily neighboring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
According to Damascus, the military action is nearing completion and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem told the UN: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and secure thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The Government is continuing its reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to a country that they have had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and to allocate funds for this purpose.
Meanwhile, the United States and European Union countries refuse to provide Syria with assistance, saying that first of all a political solution to the conflict must be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in the “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The Group’s losses are estimated at at least <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 billion.
This amount includes not only fines and compensations.
By June of next year, the automaker must buy or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the management of the company said that the obligations have already been fulfilled in respect of 83% of cars, so that the program will be completed early.
Volkswagen is fully trying to compensate for the losses and restore the trust of customers.
Thus, recently, the management of the concern was changed again, and it was also announced about a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesels on their streets: this right was given to the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against the Jews.
"It's like in fascist Germany to pin a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created," the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel.
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law,” the clergyman believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter implies the renaming of the UOC-Moscow Patriarchate.
The Deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The deputy of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times in history, our forebears and Christians, by faith and spirit, had to profess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information that we have, and the threats of massacres that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something," the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayerful, moral.
The deputy of Lavra also stressed that it is likely that “you will need your physical presence.”
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to be killed, and therefore we will protect our sanctuary."
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra – the Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, you must be ready to protect it.
The Holy Prophet (SAW) said: “Do not follow those who lead the believers astray.”
The UOC has the canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 by the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make dependence on the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew of Rome.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has," said the deputy of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 has been canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos already has our church.
What other Tomos do we need?” said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other faiths have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers have to some extent figured out and decided which temple to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes on the temples that they want to destroy shine,” he said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The Lavra is located on the top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the 13th century.

There were also those who advised Buzova to turn to psychologists or at least read books on this topic.
“Maybe you should read literature on psychology.
What do you need to do to avoid being a victim?” wrote <0x40>liashukgalina.
However, there were also those who supported the singer.
"Ola, don't worry about it.
Your man will not speak loud words to the whole country and then just do not do them," - said Buzova <0x40>arina_prostyle.
"You're a queen and you need a king, and the one who traded you for paper is just not worthy of you.

If we continue to play well, victories will come.
Head coach of the Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyov - about the defeat of "Automobilist" (0: 1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"It was a good game, it was interesting, although it went to the goal," Vorobiev said on the official website of "Automobilist".
“We tried to play very easy.
I really liked the first period.
We didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second period, the rival stabbed us a little, we stood.
But the removal of us a little "fed."
The guys played well, performed a coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play well, the victories will come.
Not scored, with zero goals, the game is not won, but the content of the game was correct.
Good luck will come if we continue to play in this direction.”
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" increased compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“Then there was no foreign team.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other problems, played a lot of young guys.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The car is a good good team.
From the tournament table, it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere both in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are many good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew that the team went without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work out.”

In Macedonia on Sunday, September 30, a referendum is held on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on the renaming of the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens are invited to answer one question: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"

This treaty should resolve a long-standing dispute over the country’s name, as well as Skopje’s path to NATO and the EU.

U.S. approves increase in opiates production in Afghanistan
There was a lot of talk about the sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, militants have launched a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record in the number of bloody attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans,” said Patrushev.
Afghanistan’s troubles did not begin yesterday.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (banned in Russia), settled in Afghanistan.
Less than a month has passed since America and NATO allies launched the military operation “Invincible Freedom” there.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of U.S. troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the peaceful life is even more spooky than it was then.
U.S. troops are being driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they buy back from the militants for money - so long as they are not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller part of the country – 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - in the Taliban movement (banned in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (banned in the Russian Federation).
But they grow fast there.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be pleased with it.
The fact that in 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Colossal growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia into the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of lengthy negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor as Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “Through this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy.”
The ruling Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
Against - the conservative opposition and the President of the country George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia makes no sense to join the EU - it is enough to have partnership relations with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government led by Zaev is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
However, this decision will have negative consequences.
First, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Faye Dulgheri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.”
