Parliament rejects amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament on Thursday rejected a proposal to repeal a section on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko was convicted.
The amendment, which would pave the way for the release of the imprisoned former prime minister, was rejected by MPs at the second reading of a proposal to ease penalties for economic crimes.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for concluding an allegedly unfavorable contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be heard by the court in December.
Tymoshenko described the verdict as political revenge of the regime, suspicion of court bias triggered a trial in the West.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
226 votes were needed to approve it.
The Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unfamiliar place in the desert.
It remains to define the winner.
As is the custom in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but the question is whether moderate or radical.
The Transitional National Council has subscribed to the customary law of Sharia, and we already have some idea of it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, because the hand is cut off for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, possible apostates from the faith waiting for execution and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival tribes will unite the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and certainly would not want.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor the objectively best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans just mentioned for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters took the help of non-believing dogs.
The only apology is that, from their point of view, NATO airstrikes were not directed by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every successful intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We took part in the gunfight, served Islam, and our politicians, in the person of a dictator, got rid of a political ally without guaranteeing any profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
Thus, the problem of expelling "crusaders" is eliminated by the locals.
But will they have Libyan black gold for a mouthful of oil companies without occupation?
There may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, the Sharia Law.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are on the lookout for investors
The statistical slump swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated interquartally, with Germany and France growing.
Today, the stock market is breaking records.
Investors no longer only look at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published preliminary forecasts of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by the expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany sided better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), but France said that it appeared in a slight decrease of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, quarterly the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated and thus confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in the growth of the economy’s performance.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The eurozone and European Union economies grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is at 28.45%.
Italian and Spanish bond yields are rising to critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are starting to feel problems too...
Yields on Czech 10-year bonds are kept below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
Germany says the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrated the 200 million
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro, thanks to a great Czech and a beautiful goalkeeper Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won 1:0.
Czech football, even with a large portion of luck in the second half, defended a luxury lead from home retaliation and again will not be missed at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress of the match in a detailed reportage.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a large portion of happiness in the second.
The Czech national team, thanks to the home defeat at the end, the great Czech and the hero Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won in Montenegro happily 1-0 and celebrates the progress to the European Championship.
Due to the precise defense of the Czech team, the Montenegrins came under pressure only in the second half.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> became the strikers of the match, who burned two big chances.
Even thanks to the great Peter <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, in addition, a prize of about CZK 200 million will be added to the cash register of domestic football.
A lot of fighting football has been played since the opening minutes.
Both teams were difficult to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the midfield.
The pressure of the domestic football players did not come in the first half, because the Czech defense accurately deterred long kicks for defense.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
Created a living shield
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
With their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students prayed in front of the building and then called for the death of the United States and Israel.
On Tuesday, several hundred university students in Isfahan, Iran, created a living shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, where uranium is processed.
They show that they are ready to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran appears to have not stopped pursuing a nuclear weapon.
A possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities is being discussed in Israel.
At noon, before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility, the students prayed and then called for the death of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at crippling Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said the target, in addition to the Isfahan center, would be a facility in Natanz where uranium is enriched.
The menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner sausages
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent of children being obese.
Obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
It shows again how important the environment in which a person grows up and the patterns in which he is surrounded are for healthy development.
On tables in obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half as often as in families of children with normal weight.
Fry fries had by dinner the day before the research associated with an awareness event called Obesity is not a coincidence for more than 19 percent of the obese.
In families of fat people, it is also not customary to play sports, but this applies to most families of today's schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children answered that their parents find time for active movement at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second year of the event Obesity is not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from the 4th to 8th grades have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and plenty of exercise in the family is one of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of children who are overweight or even obese.
“Only half of those surveyed, for example, reported eating five breakfast-breakfast-lunch-breakfast-dinner meals a day, which is one of the basic preconditions for proper nutrition,” one of the survey’s findings said.
No breakfast and evening sausage
Experts point out that for healthy development, relative details, such as regular family breakfast time, are also important.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of schoolchildren have breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst part was finding out that in a dozen households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are much more often consumed.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet lemonade every day (70 percent).
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly play sports, the result for their parents was less than half - 15 percent.
Build your own diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to make their own diet according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite dishes are a lot of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
"The high popularity of sweet lemonades is particularly alarming," the study said in its final report.
For lunch, pasta just above poultry won the main meal.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all, and the popularity of fish and midday vegetable dishes is also low.
Inclination to health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the awareness lecture, obesity is not a coincidence, in many cases there was a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project said.
For example, sweet lemonades were marked by the fact that more children would prefer plain water.
Children were also more likely to check poultry and fish as the main meal of the day and limit sweet foods and dumplings.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the introductory article about the way stylists learn, I complained so little that there was a lot already in the introductory lessons.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three professionals in the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it works on the stage.
And it's gonna get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "stuck".
This time, Director Alenka and I discussed (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly symmetrical figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight.
A stylist must know how to visually soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We got tips on how a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. bigger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too challengingly.
For example, if the difference between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or pants really do not fit, then it is worth to have at least one such piece tailored to you.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are unbeatable.
In a skirt tailored to you you will feel much better than in one that constantly shifts, leans out, lags behind in the waist and the like.
The boy's character can afford to wear clothes with trimming, applications, embroidery or picking.
Of course, there are many such information and types of characters, so I am glad that I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And I'm still afraid that given the homework I've been assigned, there's a lot going on.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity to invent two outfits: daytime and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashionable style of a given personality and the type of character.
I'll "dress" Miranda Kerr, you may know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I am happy in spirit, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained about a hundred kilos (please take into account the exaggeration), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print and then graphically process them.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, then expresses our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic aspect of styling is also important.
The stylist does not only dress physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for specific purposes, for example, trendy handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k told us about it.
But not until Sunday.
A stylist must have a general overview
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about the types of characters, was enriched by three guests from the industry.
Stylist Honza The humble, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
James reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to use it.
And a handy stylist can work with one piece of clothing in different ways.
Variability is key in this case.
So, for example, such a trenchcoat (or if you originally want a trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and a T-shirt as a coat, but you can also wear it on a bare body, put on boats and take pictures as a dress.
Or just roll up your sleeves or collars and immediately the whole look looks different.
"Play with it," he said.
But what I appreciated most was the following advice: "You need to know the rules perfectly for work."
"Then you can start breaking them," said Jakub.
Finally, it is clear to me why we are crushing all the lessons, what to combine with, what to do, why, even if we sometimes see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that the stylist must have much more clothes ready than they can take.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo of clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces sometimes completely different than in reality.
This is something that we need to take into account when creating an outfit.
The fact that image and style sometimes make up half of the success was confirmed by Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miraculous singer, but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to using the services of stylists is rather cold.
Even familiar faces sometimes consider it useless (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone lets us create styling, then we have to count on the fact that he will most likely dictate to us a completely different (smaller) size than he really has.
Then you have to google and see if the boulevard hasn’t written about the fact that the celebrity has lost weight and the like.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario put it on our hearts that it is not enough for a stylist to orient himself in fashion and be able to assemble an outfit.
In his work, he primarily communicates with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to be incited, to stand for your opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to sort out her wardrobe and add nice pieces to it, you can't throw away the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
"Find at least a few things you'll praise and recommend what they can be worn for," Mario says.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "place bag", or bag for the place.
It's the one you put around your waist and you have all the necessary propriety with you.
In addition to bright things such as scissors, hair roller or closing pins, there is also a nylon thread (with which the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips that will clamp clothes at the back, if it is larger (a pin or other clamp would not be allowed), a pin or a pin.
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly water shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where there is a flat surface, the sole could be damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We should not even touch the shoes with the scissors, so that they do not accidentally get damaged.
It really needs skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is only a small fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the pink orchard, no matter who says what they want.
Need for Speed: The Run is an American racing game.
Testimonials
Originally a carefree ride, due to a series of completely unnecessary sloppy mistakes, it turns into a routine morning trip to a shift.
Although the ambition was largely fulfilled, it is not worth it if no one obviously wanted to do anything more.
The new episode with the subtitle The Run aroused high expectations before the release.
He promised that the old Need for Speed racing series would once again move a bit in a new direction and from playable demos it seemed like a game that would not have to be just a number in the genre of action racing.
We were also curious how the inserted passages would turn out, in which the protagonist would get out of the car and run on his own.
But as with the NFS series, many things are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole drags down a few unnecessary mistakes that have been appearing in the series for several years.
So these are not even mistakes, but rather a manifestation of some incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain personal problems and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You drive on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to arrive first in New York.
The idea carries with it several interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then more than fifty races.
It follows that each race is driven on a different track and the stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don’t feel like the game offers the same thing all the time.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to see, although the technical level of graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing world-class.
But driving through the desert, autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains looks visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time diversified by some atypical element.
In the desert, for example, you will wind up in a sandstorm, which significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be overwhelmed by an avalanche.
In addition, the individual races are quite well placed after each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you catch up with time (classic fight with stopwatches), and then you will be waiting for a duel with a single opponent.
From time to time, even the police will get involved in this, which makes all your efforts even more unpleasant.
The novelty is the passages outside the car.
It’s more of an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right moments.
It's not complicated.
Surprisingly, however, there are far fewer of these passages in the game than you would expect (in particular, perhaps only three).
In the end, however, it is to the benefit of the matter, because this element has no chance of becoming annoying and in the context of the above, it is thus among the elements that diversify the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely not something nowadays, but it can not be said that it would be a negative.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-packed racing, the local driving model still fits quite well, even though we could find a better one in the competition.
So far, everything is in perfect order.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
Unlike the driving model, the model is no longer colliding.
From a game of this type we do not expect it to calculate complex deformations and collisions, but if before virtually any impact on any object you do not have the slightest idea how your car will behave, then probably not everything is in order.
Typically, when overtaking or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes you just lick each other slightly, but other times in an almost identical situation, your car ends up in wild pirouettes.
Or even straight forward.
Thanks to the restart system, it does not matter much, but it will reliably defuse you.
Restarts are solved so that if you break or go far off the track, the game will throw you back to the last catch point on the track.
There are only five reboots available in each race.
When you run out of them, you have to start the race again.
Therefore, it is more of a help in case something does not work, than if you can rely on them explicitly.
But sometimes even restarts do not help, they will be solved only by the need to learn a given section of the race by heart.
The big disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some corners, for example, need to pass in a specific way, otherwise you simply will not fit into them.
Other times you will meet "civil" cars in the same configuration at a given place, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially true in situations where you can see an opponent passing easily between two opposing cars in front of you, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to bypass or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "counted" so that the situation always occurs just before your nose.
The opponents have another advantage.
During the whole game you will encounter several places where, again regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent at the same place.
Most of all, it beats at the end of the game on a long bridge, where you drive in the opposite direction.
The opponent must get there before you, perhaps at any cost.
When it drives in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the opposite cars, so at first you get a lot of smashing.
You can understand the intention to make the game more exciting and adrenaline-filled, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably disgust you quickly.
And it's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and sometimes action-packed enough that sometimes you literally can't keep track of what's flying.
And it doesn’t really matter if it’s a concept with 50 unique tracks, sorting races so that boredom doesn’t have a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to watch out for petrol pumps on the road, because that’s where you can change the car, even though in the vast majority of cases you can do with what you just have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sportsmen are suitable for urban areas, strong American storms on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example, on winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand with the challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common to the challenges and the story.
To get a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with cars and ending with backgrounds for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online Autolog function, which compares your results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other difficult to understand is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the subway tunnel (be it), where you drive it in the dark on the tracks (be it).
The tachometer flashes the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (albeit) and in this the metro set arrives from behind and uncompromisingly scrapes you.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a few more days of discussion about whether no one really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors consider us to be really such a fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing special, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes in such a way that at some of the more tense moments the shooting decreases, and in some cases quite tragically.
But this applies especially to storms with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would no longer be useful to you anyway.
The sound page is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to please the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog is a different village" was created, but it can be assumed that because of listening to music, someone will probably not buy the game.
Need for Speed: The Run: Need for Speed: The Run
If the game were to avoid completely unnecessary errors, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of the NFS for the last few years.
This is how the game works unfinished.
It’s definitely fun, but be prepared for mistakes that will blow your eyes with the power of airport spotlights.
Singing choirs of the UK will be heard at the concert Students of Velvet

EU Ambassador Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1>:
Czechs have a reputation for being negative and Eurosceptic
"The Lisbon Treaty has seriously upset the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
To what extent she takes her motto "Clearly and openly about Europe" seriously, she already showed in the first part of the lecture, when she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of the UK could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was criticism that he was indistinct, that he was a gray clerk, that he could not perform any role, and I must say that everyone was blown away, that the role was excellent."
"He is a person who can listen to twenty-seven Member States, communicates well with them and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
She then explained the new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What phone number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one wants to ban mermaids.
Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> also addressed the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success.
The Czechs have dealt with the onset of the financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
She then called the fall of the government at that time a great negative, which greatly damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact of frmol" was not only the Presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis, which is still being resolved today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union has yet to be approved, which is becoming much more complicated due to the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slender and austere, which sectors will be preferred, which countries will be supported more and which less, all are on the agenda of the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: "On Europe intelligible".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, strange words, a lingerie that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that curvy or round cucumbers are not really invented in Brussels, bananas of different sizes, or that someone really has to ban us cheeses?
He also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, Czechs have a reputation as eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
Moreover, she regrets the low representation of Czechs in European institutions.
According to her, many factors are to blame, for example, the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Look, what are you meeting there, what about your Visegrad Four?' and he doesn't look excited about it at all."
In the future, the Union, according to Vicen<0xC3><0xA1>, is waiting mainly for new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
He sees the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe as very real, rather than a new "European federation."
"We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have the Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
“For the first time, it was said that only countries that wanted to cooperate and those that didn’t want to stay away.”
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in enforcing the principle that all topics having an impact on the whole of the Union should be discussed between all Member States, and not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM innovator begins second century of its existence
If someone were looking for a word that most accurately expresses IBM’s strategy, the closest one would probably be “longevity.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is a company perceived as very present, and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this longevity was laid by the company’s first CEO, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the slogan that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" thus became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine that began to appear at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the foundation of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current CEO.
A sophisticated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in the same way as the businessman Bata in the Czech Republic - the people of IBM, as one of the first American employees, had paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system for rewarding the best inventors and traders.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was a genius at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so that it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to be replaced next year by a woman named Virginia Rometta.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and is still the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called pits, online brainstorming, out of which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are enough ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
Institutions with a good name
A strong position in business is ensured by the firm’s strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than just a technology company,” Harvard Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter, the author of the IBM book, told Economist.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” said George Colony, a consultant at Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, the difference between entering the market and creating the market.
IBM – or the “Big Blue,” as it is nicknamed for its logo in the United States – has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is probably the most versatile technology company - it develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the most patents of all U.S. technology companies, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a credit card, a financial swap, a barcode, or a floppy disk.
IBM, with an estimated $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple) when it overtook Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
A Look Forward
Not all products and innovations hit the tastes of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online Prodigy services or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally relate to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, leave them.
Unlike the rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Perspective Technology
IBM’s services account for the largest share of sales, accounting for about one-fifth of all software and hardware.
Back in 1990, it was the most powerful hardware company with more than half the share.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, during which time it invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern financial crisis overtook the world for the first time.
IBM is acting on the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis intact.
IBM’s stock price has risen 120 percent since early 2008, and the company’s net profit has been steadily rising.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything, but not your values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will cope with it.
IBM History: From Cheese Slicer to Space Flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a century ago, originally called Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was not adopted until 1924 – originally a brand used for the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
The basis for the later IBM was the merger of four companies whose history dates back to the eighties of the nineteenth century.
They owned technologies such as the famous "pussy", that is, the clock recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the supervisory board of the company.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival company, to help him manage the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all sorts of machines for business - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years that Watson led the company, the company doubled its turnover to $9 million and began a large-scale expansion of the company to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that after almost forty years in the boss's chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr..
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence, developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM’s people and computers helped NASA fly into space—to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous man-to-moon flight.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "bake" that set the computer standard of the time, called IBM 5150, came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, on the contrary, it bought the consulting part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and began to fully devote itself to consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the past three years is the concept of Smarter Planet.
Its aim is the smart use of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned and the improvement of the situation, for example in transport or city administration.
IBM recently launched the “Smarter Commerce” platform to help traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
It established its branch in the then Czechoslovakia already in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, there is also a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern European Centre is headquartered in Prague and there is also a world-class voice recognition research team.
About an unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said the end!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>r (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from the pink dream and return home.
But now she is not going to wait, and she has set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1> gave Barto<0xC5><0xA1> asylum in her home in the summer, she apparently had no idea how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved out of <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>any after 30 days at her insistence, Pep did not leave the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, seemingly reconciled with her husband's relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
He doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> and Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> had broken up once, the open arms of his wife would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common house, no one will drive him out."
"But he will live it not as my beloved, lost old donkey, but as a man with whom I have certain ties," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, saying that she had already detached herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind that Darina closed his back door.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change that."
"My wife has arranged a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, shopping."
"Darina and I have a normal conversation, except we don't share a bed together," said Lightning Rider.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> also finds a new love, she will not be prevented from doing so.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with, and if he has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all responsibility," Josef concluded.
Worst Women's Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men if they can list some typical female bad habits, they usually all fall out of their sleeve very quickly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female bad habits that can perfectly pump blood in the veins of men?
Shopping carts
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one cloth per week?
Do you like to shop in bulk in discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least tame their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, who would resist just strolling through clothing stores, looking for well-fitting tops and then trying them all (ideally in different color designs) in the cabin?
Although for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become literally a finished hell.
Just remember how many times you've told your friend to wait for you at the front door...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Do these words remind you of anything?
Isn't that right?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an endless carousel.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping tiles, wiping dust, rubbing the bath - at least twice a week.
Do you blame your partner for stepping with his dirty foot on clean tiles, the children for getting dirty on the scrubbed sink and covering the glass living room wall with which you have put so much work into polishing?
In the event that you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not come first within the family.
This innocuous desire for cleanliness can jeopardize your relationships and family well-being.
R<0xC3><0xBD>p<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD>
"Throw those used shorts in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you sniff at your partner several times a day, know that you can reliably dial him.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is all right.
Maybe if men knew that, women wouldn't have to stab them so hard...
Gossip, gossip
For some women, gossip, gossip, but also insults and association against someone are also their own.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Perhaps each of us will release some harmless gossip or slander here.
Hands on the heart, it's all women's property.
But the opposite is the gossip of the grossest grain, which they like and often gossip about, perhaps they despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their environment - especially within the framework of the women's work collective.
Jagr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jagr took part in the NHL match on Monday with two assists to the Philadelphia 5:3 win on the ice of Carolina and is again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the review of the 39-year-old star benefited in both cases Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was named the best player of the match.
Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the game, Jagr told overseas reporters that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the game he was going to give a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you get that feeling," Jagr explained, after which Giroux scored the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later, the second hit of the team had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won a disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to scoring Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in weakness by home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, Giroux.
After collaborating with J<0xC3><0xA1>ger, he scored a third goal, then his shot remelted into the fourth goal of Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league, but he’s definitely one of the top three,” Jagr said.
“I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
“All those years in the NHL my teammates tried to play me, now it’s turning around,” Jagr added.
Carolina still made the game a drama, a goal by Tuoma Ruutu, and again Dwyer, who made it through the penalty shootout, got the difference of one goal.
Matt Read, who ended up renumbering two to one, did not allow any further complications.
"Excellently hit in our Pronger zone."
"He kicked out the disc, I picked up the speed, and (Read) went to the farthest pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," he described the final goal of the match from his own point of view.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
The Candiens, in addition to the experienced bek, lost the double-sided lead and lost after a penalty shootout 2:3.
One of their raids did not change Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
The home coach, rather than the lost points, was hated by the large back row, with only five defenders finishing the match.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were youngsters."
"But there's nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"We were hit by alternations, and we couldn't resist."
"We should have simplified the game more, pushed the puck out of our zone."
We had gaps in that," one of the defenders, P.K. Subban, added.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed thirty winnipeg hits to a 5:2 win over Tampa Bay.
The goals of the Jets, who interrupted a five-game series of losses, were shared by five different shooters.
How travel prices have evolved since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, travel agencies were selling, for the most part, only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled on holiday to the sea to the GDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Sochi in the Crimea by the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
The bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia was also available, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the travels of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from that country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand the queue overnight with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the travel agency.
However, this was not the case.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not granted to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange promise it was not possible to obtain funds (the Western currency) for the trip to the West.
By far, however, most often the Czechs spent their holidays in the Czech Republic, which resulted in a large number of cottages and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this custom survives to this day.
The journey of the Czechs has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria were our maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays abroad in countries around the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel to Croatia, currently the most popular one, until 1989, as it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighbouring Western European countries was abolished, triggering a huge wave of short-term visits, mainly to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
For a long time the Czechoslovaks could not get enough of trips to the West, everyone wanted to look there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in parks in tents, because our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or guesthouse.
A typical feature of the travel of the Czechs at this time was driving their own food, cans, salami, etc. to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely convertible Czech crown, which allowed our tourists to buy the Western currency freely after many decades.
However, our standard of living and, with it, our average wages have risen, resulting in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have been preparing charter flights regularly since 1997, making air travel incredibly cheaper than in the past due to the possibility to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs already had visa-free travel to almost all developed countries in the world, except the USA, which continued to facilitate our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000, when, due to significant demand, the first direct charter flight to exotic destinations was made from the Czech Republic, to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters fly with Czech tourists every year to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by about 100 thousand Czechs every year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, for the first time in history, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in history they spent more than CZK 15,000 per person for one foreign holiday, including the cost of the place of residence.
The general meeting is supposed to find the chairman, but again the pat
For almost five months, Czech football has been without a chairman and there is a threat that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek as the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after the next extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement as to what the electoral process will be.
Without it, it will not even begin to vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k have an interest in leading Czech football.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June and, on his departure, called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, in the post-Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek era, football slipped back into a fight between the two union chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
On September 16th, a new president was elected.
The delegates of the General Meeting met in the National House in Prague in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov for nothing, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of election.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote at the assembly - whether only statutory representatives or even officials entrusted with full powers.
At this single point, since then, there has been a partial agreement, which has been helped by the recommendation of the Constitution for the State and the law, according to which representation on the basis of power of attorney is not possible.
However, there is still debate about the electoral system.
The Executive Committee has not brought too clearly into the situation, which in its meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, has not addressed anything else.
The view of the choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to act in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said Dusan Svoboda, one of the three vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in the association's leadership.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate who will have more percentage support in the chamber for which he is running will win.
Moravia is reportedly willing to make concessions to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech side advocates the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage census.
"But then it would lose its meaning in the two previous rounds, it would completely deny the two-chamber concept," he understands the objections of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which it would be best not to bend the order and vote according to the current statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral code determined by the statutes suits Pelt the most of all candidates.
"I wish to vote as much as possible according to the statutes."
"In order not to invent some substitute nonsense as at the last general meeting," said the owner of Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements he was primarily against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In Nymburk, he said, the new president will be known and believes that the candidates will work together constructively in the future.
"All passions will be reassured by today's eventual progress of the national team to the European Championships."
"Football will again be on a happy wave, there will be more willingness to cooperate," says the official from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience in managing football both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but unfortunately the situation is very divided."
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are efforts to tailor the regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the general meeting to be blocked again."
"But I hope common sense will prevail," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete for the match.
The aeronautical special, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were supposed to travel to Podgorica, namely, he did not fly from Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and was looking for a replacement option for how to transport part of the executive committee to the scene of the barrage retaliation.
In the end, a meeting at the ministerial level may be decisive, which may take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like to bring the divided parties within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot in the game: state subsidies, the credibility of football, as well as the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k goes to fight for the president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of the Pilsen football team, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, saw a strong candidate in front of an extraordinary general meeting who would meet all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even join the fight for the top position.
"If there is a good candidate, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to vote."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is motivated to try to avoid Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, on his way to the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R leadership.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also stresses that if he wins, he would only hold the presidency until 2013, when a regular general meeting is on the agenda.
In his position, he would like to see an experienced and top manager, who is not very connected with football.
"I've talked to some people who might be interested."
“It was crazy for me when some people said they didn’t even want to identify with Czech football at the moment.”
“I want to change that view,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is said to be most disturbed by Pelt’s association with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association, Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation, known behind the scenes as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the votes of delegates at the general meeting.
For Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, it is so unacceptable for Pelta to take office.
"If he had won, the current situation would have been preserved and nothing would have moved forward in football."
“In combination with the support of Berber, who is a prolific trader, this would not benefit football any more,” Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also hints that Pelt's name was eavesdropped years ago in an investigation of a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who also takes his former statement that he would "sell the Pilsen club if Pelta became chairman".
If Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had triumphed in Thursday’s election, he could have imagined a future collaboration with Pelta.
Another candidate, Rajchl, who Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k supported before a September general meeting that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go to."
"He has great powers."
"I could imagine him as the head of the national team."
"But he couldn't manage the association as a manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who drew a lot of attention in September by standing behind the appeal of the panel of judges headed by Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k says he'd dare to run the association.
He refers to his skills in managing private companies, and since last summer he has also headed Pilsen, which, with his support, celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
“I have the strength to make a difference in the football environment, to contribute to a certain cultivation of it.”
"To limit the influence of certain interest groups, which, for example, tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal committee, which goes to disgusting situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who does not hide his antipathies, for example, to Spartan boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
He would also consider the strengthening of relations between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee as one of his priorities, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from the lottery tax into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing."
“If there is a tax on gambling, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they have to tell the truth about where the money will go,” he said.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k does not even take his connection with the Pilsen club as a burden, although he himself claims that the president of FACR should be "super-party".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in the Pilsen club and returning there in a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new statutes of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, which would exclude electoral pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the candidates for President Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, he would make sure that FA<0xC4><0x8C>R had new statutes that would definitively rule out disputes over the electoral code in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will significantly dampen the possible success of today's football team.
Before the September election, Pelta promised to focus on representation and fundraising in the event of an election.
He decided to go to the polls at the last minute before the last general meeting, so he could use a two-month delay to defend his ideas about football management and present it in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been doing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
"He feels it's time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has served for many years in Sparta and the union's executive committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He believes that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, statutes were approved that were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they don't allow different interpretations, we've had a president since September," Pelta said.
It was the reworking of the most important document of the civic association that he considered as a branch to delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing that we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he is trying not to limit himself against his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Heinrich Reichl, whom he recognized for his legal education, and he knew that his opponent would be his first vice-president.
He did not attack Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k for a long time, who, on the contrary, did not leave the thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for a little over a year, he's already had some successes."
“But his attacks were unworthy and he surprised a lot of people in the way of the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them are now doubting his true character," he told Pelt, who remains faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
This should be the hallmark of football.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians or the resounding corruption scandal of last year."
"Immediately after that, I would have rushed to negotiations with the private and public sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate said two months ago.
He also promised that his arrival at the head of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I'd have to get acquainted with the workload of the individual employees first," he said to Strahov, where there was understandable nervousness over the long period of powerlessness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios, which accompany the upcoming general meeting, they believe that on Thursday delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily.
"If the only point of contention is how he's going to vote in the third round, then we can get over it."
“Football needs credibility, and that’s the only way it’s going to win by finally having its leader back,” Pelta said two days before the eventual defining day of his career.
Rajchl promises that FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard under it
If the current vice-president Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was elected the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at Thursday’s general meeting, many people in the association would not be pleased with this.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
He wants to push for systemic change and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work that the previous President Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football, performance football to youth."
"But I'm not saying that I would do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the Czech News Agency.
“I’m a team player and I want to share the competencies in the executive committee so that each member is dedicated to a specific area.”
“And I’m going to give away hard tasks to keep football moving a mile forward in each of these segments.”
“A lot of people probably wouldn’t enjoy it because it would start to work really hard and not just criticize the work of others,” he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said he was considering not running again.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw sticks under my feet and question my every move," he explained.
"A lot of people told me not to give up, because then others would give up."
"It's a trust I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"There's been a lot of work done in the last two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are started processes that will have a resonance, even in a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with concern that if another candidate is elected, Miroslav Pelta, the situation at the union could return to the time before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something I don't think Mirek Pelta can do."
"There are people behind him who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"A lot of things can be blamed on me, but certainly not that I'm on someone's side."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the chosen ones," Rajchl said.
He also refutes the claim that he would only be the Czech president.
"Although some people try to say otherwise, I plan to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it's time to think about splitting the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would go to the first league."
"There would not be such a situation where there are only three Moravian units in the league, which is a problem towards young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k has also joined the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances of being elected.
“I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president and sees that there are clear achievements behind me,” said Rajchl, who considers saving tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, negotiating TV contracts and negotiating the lottery law as his achievements.
But he does not feel complicit in the fact that the union does not pull on a single rope.
While Pelt claims to be "disqualified from restoring confidence in Czech football", Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k considers the second opponent a strong candidate who has a lot to offer football.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year."
"If he had been elected, perhaps he would have continued with the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not have fundamentally changed the staffing in the commissions."
"He wouldn't want to twist it in his favor," Rajchl says.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump to the blue
Julia Stanek
A pebble pool from the perspective of Ufona, a luxurious swimming pool in Budapest: Who travels through Europe, can experience his blue wonder - and after exploring the cities or traveling let his tired feet rest in the thermal baths.
The book will show where the wellness by the water is the most beautiful.
When Iris Meder spent the past one and a half years exploring, her luggage should not have been missing: her swimsuits.
Lying a hint on the water, she looked up into the artistic domes, swimming opposite the marble putti (i.e. a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admiring the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it to her notebook in an instant - with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of it.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the historian of Meder architecture and are now presented in her newly published book "Badefreuden": People's swimming pools in Munich, historical swimming palaces in Schwarzwald, "The solid core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In 13 countries she was guided by her "Road to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited locations in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true swim culture enthusiast.
It doesn’t exaggerate with sports, says Meder – it’s something else in the water.
The furious thing is that swim fans have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful swaying of birds in the park.
“One day I asked why swimming pools always have to be so ugly,” says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice swimming pools."
Water level doubles architecture
Jumping in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all the senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real grazing place for the eyes: "In place of the floor, a person has a water surface in the baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything visually doubles: a high vault, colorful tiles, jumping boards.
The small-format picture book "Badefreuden" provides 190 pages of everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases of wellness - but above all it arouses the desire to jump into the blue.
Notable specimens were discovered by the swimmer Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful healing spas, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi spa in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a thermal bath, the pools of which are filled with alkaline water and are located in a building in the shape of a bottle (Terrosi<0xC3><0xA1>).
In contrast, many heated outdoor swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a beautiful spectacle. While one can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop swimming pool, one can see the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton - and: In the steam baths there is a window.
Perhaps the most remarkable design of the pool awaits spa guests in Längenfeld: the Ötztal Aquapark looks like a ufo that has just landed in the Alps.
From the three upward-open basins in winter, steam rises while in the background of the Ötztal mountain rises to the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, Mrs. Meder's pool collector's smell of chlorine rose into her nostrils.
Many thermal baths can be smelled after sulfur, in the <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d spa in the Hungarian Békescsaba it smells of heating oil to such an extent that one can hardly believe that he got into a healing spa.
The smell comes from healing water containing alkaline hydrocarbons, which is almost black and whose deposits stick to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a rather special wellness experience.
However, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for a nice spa: when she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climatic spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x8D> designed baths were closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked at the decaying windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the weeds growing enormously between the tiles.
The extinction was opposed in a magical swimming pool in Schwarzwald: in the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These baths have already gone through three stages of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that date back to the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was attached around 1900.
Since the careful modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal has been a popular spa place for the pool expert Mrs. Iris Meder, not only because she comes from the Schwarzwald.
"It's a performance to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
At such a palace, immersion in a thermal pool is probably a marginal matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank to Investigate Commodity Trade
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its agricultural raw materials business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the company’s chief executive will take action.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For federal citizens, the point is clear: 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable, according to one study, for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from the trade because it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity exchanges push prices upwards and banks are therefore complicit in the world hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer protectionists is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although big banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley do the same.
Commodity bets were originally intended to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants interested in high-risk trades have detached themselves from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann reacted to criticism: He promised to check the reproaches and said that no trade "is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at stake".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is reviewing complaints from Foodwatch-Report.
The audit is to be closed by the end of the year, and the results will then be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - together with a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the bank would like to announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the trade in commodities or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works self-help on his image.
Thilo Bode, head of Foodwatch, welcomed the report, but also intensified his criticism of the financial sector: “Bets on rising food prices show particularly drastically how indiscriminately the bank is harming the common good today.”
Let Ackermann, as the highest bank lobbyist, live up to his duties.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all items that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"Whether Mr. Ackermann is starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s view seems surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the company’s boss would like to leave a perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not join the supervisory board otherwise than planned.
By turning away from controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he doesn't have to worry about possible losses - his successor should deal with it eventually.
Every second would deny investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Eleven percent said it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments linked to bets on food prices.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank was involved in such transactions: One in two would denounce all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation as a result of a survey.
43% would warn a known bank, 49% said they would consider cancelling their account and move to another institution.
House of the 21st century in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
A story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion at the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and vacant.
Now it is reopened as an exhibition house.
When it is dedicated to modern post-war architecture, bright forms, glass halls, bold sprawls and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technological progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World's Fair is a fitting and famous example.
The Schwanzer pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and lofty steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He made the architect famous by building the pavilion of Austria during the next world exhibitions.
With his legendary four-cylinder BMW-palace plus as a key made by the side building in Munich, he eventually became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the projected pavilion after the World's Fair was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Südbahnhof (Southern Railway Station) in Vienna, was reconstructed and in 1962 the Museum of the 20th Century was opened - it was named "House of the 20th Century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art reached a new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building has been empty and was wasted more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used as a Museum of Contemporary Art in the future.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Belvedere Museum, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
Agnes Husslein-Arco became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a prom art historian with a distinguished career, i.a. in her youth figure skating, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modernity Salzburg, strongly promoted the reconstruction of politicians and conservationists, provided public funds and private sponsorship money.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a cafe and a bookstore should be established, and an office building should be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand Joseph Olbrich’s Art Nouveau buildings in Vienna and won the competition, but he studied at the Technical University of Vienna with Schwanzer and the pavilion was an “extremely important place” for him, where he visited exhibitions “almost every weekend”.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and changed its use.
There were far bigger problems with the current reconstruction: the building was a “catapult for energy,” Krischanitz says.
The profiles of the glass facade windows were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulation glass was used, and the glass roof was replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridge-steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings refurbished.
Two underground floors provided a place for new use, a recessed lighting canal between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the lofty Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion reddish-brown color tone.
And the cinema is still exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument office and a low budget.
“Often there had to be material that was good and cheap and also liked the monument office,” Krischanitz says, pointing to the broken basement floor.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It was said to be difficult with the pavilion "that came here from Brussels," Krischanitz, a typical "drop-in-the-city-history," said recently.
Such architecture is said to be “always in the wrong place” and yet “to build the right self-confidence”.
In this case, however, the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because an urban lucky accident happened: In the circle around the Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City District at the Main Railway Station" with office and residential buildings is being created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: The 21st century house could receive support from another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Temporäre Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already negotiating with the city about the neighborhood at the site in Schweizer Garten.
The railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of millions
The railway has come up with a crisis plan to prevent trains from crashing in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter-induced train outages and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a newspaper report.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with reference to the company's internal plan that it is expected to invest a total of about 300 million euros by 2015.
It aims to improve the use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people for snow removal at railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary shifts during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, railway chief Rüdiger Grube warned after a top-level meeting with government and industry officials about train outages and delays during this winter.
In the last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger transport, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Thus, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for approval by the Federal Railways Authority for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains
For years, the railway has also been unable to cope with the fact that ICE train repairs must probably be checked more often when a ICE train at Cologne Central Station destroyed the axle.
Deutsche Bank pays a million dollar fine in the United States
After a riot around boss Josef Ackermann, there are new trampolines in the US: Deutsche Bank has to pay millions of dollars in compensation there.
As if Deutsche Bank hadn’t had enough problems at home, the giant in the industry has caught up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt institution pays $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in one settlement procedure to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA’s financial market regulator blames a number of large banks for misleading cooperative banks into buying financial products; it seems that they have reduced the risks.
Such securities have lost significantly in value during the crisis and have plunged the banks into the abyss with them.
"We are pleased that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank admits no guilt.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has pledged to pay out $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the support of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and helps with bankruptcy to protect customer claims.
The NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
Now completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator also pinned on other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Mortgage-backed securities are called Mortgage-backed securities.
They are based on bank loans.
When the US real estate bubble collapsed in 2007, it became fatal for a number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mindset.
Even though the events took place a few years ago, there is now a strong wind blowing in the banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits in order to obtain redress or to be wronged.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the biggest wave of lawsuits.
He accuses 18 international big banks that two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Deutsche Bank also faces a lawsuit by the FHFA, with more transactions totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The Investigative Office demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying any exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the request as unfounded and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers because long-term development of companies is difficult to predict.
But now he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Already much earlier he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT-departments of other enterprises.
Warren Buffett’s investment in the financial world is considered a knighthood.
As a result, IBM's mother rock can now be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought 10.7 billion dollars worth of IBM shares since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that even IBM didn’t know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, who even tried to get proper returns during the economic crisis.
"You've done a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has long relied on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old pioneer of computers also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has been avoiding tech companies to this day.
It claims to invest only in companies whose activities it also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached for the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machinery manufacturer.
His Berkshire Hathaway Holding also owns shares in a number of major corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
An 81-year-old man took over Berkshire Hathaway, a small textile company, in the 1960s, and built it into one of the world’s most valuable businesses with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of making money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM’s shares rose one percent before the stock market began.
Big Blue, as IBM is also called, has a total stock price of more than $220 billion and is considered, along with Apple and Microsoft, the world’s most valuable technology companies.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts wouldn't want to play.
Bill Gates is said to be his best friend.
The threat is tangible
After the unveiling of the "Zwickau Cell", Turkish media questioned the German rule of law.
The newspapers are even talking about a "bloody ideology" that is now coming to life again.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This report was reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turks, this brings back a ghost that has long been considered dead: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been in doubt.
However, the right-wing extremist network discovered reveals an extent whose dimensions can no longer be traced.
“Is the bloody ideology coming to life again?” read the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, stressed that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police agent of the department for the protection of the Constitution and feared that the German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted prudently: It recalled the weekend with demonstrations of silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
Several Turkish media outlets are reporting: "Germany's Gift to the Fifty" is the headline of an article in the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murder series.
Also, the publication of the "Hürriyet" for Germany cannot be taken in order not to make this mental connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of a column by Ahmet Külahci.
He stressed that people who had paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany had been murdered.
The most critically discussed in German-Turkish Internet forums is the police’s progress and its late success in the search.
Why didn’t the German authorities think much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
So many are at least rhetorically quick to use drastic means: "If the activity here continues to be carried out so superficially, there will be nothing left for immigrants but their own defense and armament."
"That would be the best self-defense."
"The quality of the clarification and adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very much on the internal peace in Germany," Selen writes.
What it means if inner peace in Germany is threatened is explained by the Mölln and Solingen assassinations in the 1990s.
The photos of the burnt-out area in Solingen are deeply engraved in the memory of the Germans and the Turks.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that distrust and secession can result in right-wing violence.
However, the attacks made the Turkish side feel more reciprocated.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press criticised the failure of German politics after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a condolence telegram to the Turkish president, but he was replaced at the mourning ceremony in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the local Turks paid.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local state legal system is.
In addition to efforts to clarify and re-evaluate right-wing extremism in Germany, this time requires open words.
Scandal Bank at Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has almost gone bankrupt during the financial crisis and has since moved from one crisis to the next.
Now a German has to make up for it.
That's not what Axel Weber thought.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank in July, it became known that he would enter 2013 into an almost equally spectacular new job: the president of the board of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed publicity, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and made friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"Die UBS has made a turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But in September, it was clear that everything would turn out completely different.
One UBS dealer in London has bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wasted some 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, not only a renowned Swiss banker, had to leave.
The president of the UBS board of directors has also been burned since then – and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber has been allowed to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board as early as May - not just in 2013, as the bank reported on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather a professor of economics and an issue banker, and he would certainly need time to work on it.
At the same time, he will take responsibility for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that it deserves the title of “Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe”
Because UBS is huge – until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager – and has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will be left to the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a silent and solid but also cunning asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: It also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
Thus, UBS 2007 managed, on the one hand, with $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has advanced as an investment bank to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, said: “I always used UBS as an example of a good bank to my students back then.”
"From today's perspective, one asks, 'How could I be so wrong?'"
He was very wrong.
In 2007, it became clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, surprisingly, Peter Wuffli, the chairman of the board of directors, who until now was considered to be a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, he knew why he had left.
The bank's investment division wasted Subprime paperwork and had to write off billions.
To keep this up, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
However, it did find investors, but one that it would have been overshadowed recently: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, it was worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, 2006 still the second best-paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster followed: UBS, owing to its misinvestment during the financial crisis, faced a collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks on its territory.
After all, the balance sheet sum of UBS 2007 was more than five times the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“We could not save UBS again,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months, UBS has capitulated to this in a tax dispute with the United States and has shown willingness to release data of wealthy customers who, if possible, with the help of banks, cut taxes.
In addition, she agreed to pay out $780 million — as a refund of unauthorised profits from these trades, including a fine.
This made UBS more or less openly aware that it was helping to reduce taxes.
At the same time, she has lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for wealthy clients: a sanctuary of discretion.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the head of the board and the president of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customer money.
Thus, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas over the course of a few months: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help cut taxes.
And just as it calmed down a bit again, just as UBS was thought to be recovering again, here comes this unfortunate trading anabase: The only dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was wrong.
And it is clear: with risk management in investment banking, it seems to be still not working.
“The Adoboli case may have shown that risk control has changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of a large German bank is also confident: "The problem with UBS is that it does not manage risk control."
Yet it was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago taken steps to become the guardians of the world's great assets: no too great risks, but security for money - also from this side the Alpine republic again collapsed the world.
Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the cliché of a good Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank is headquartered in Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rental shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery stores like Tiffany's are among the Swiss traditional shops like the Sprüngli confectionery.
For centuries, Swiss banks have been based here: from the Nationalbank to the Palace of the Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS reception hall is accessed by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them are massive leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large pointer to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
This idea was sometimes suppressed or betrayed by both Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspapers, and in the end, like all Swiss bankers, he closes deals with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also expanded.
The Swiss have nothing more to say.
"And if they did, they would have adapted to the Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it high profits at first and then disaster: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as the Schweizer Großbank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was evident.
“On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-strong country decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Up to 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save a bankrupt large bank.
How could this happen?
If you are talking to Swiss bankers, you see the problem mainly in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss banks merged into a large group.
A bank was created that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One rich but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on property management and a poorer but more internationally involved bank.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came up with a lot of money to spin the big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intelligent, the modest, who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man of feeling around the stomach, who has developed completely upward from banking science."
But Ospel was said to have relied on Wuffli at the end.
And Wuffli probably made a crucial mistake at the end: “I guess he thought his models were reality,” Geiger says.
"That's a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember executive meetings, at which Wuffli’s CEO repeated the same slogan over and over again: “Drop Goldman Sachs off the throne.”
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
It featured "League Tables", a ranking that documents the success of the banks of the time.
In it, UBS tried to place it completely at the top.
A few steps had already been taken.
In the foreign exchange and stock trade, she took part in the game at the very top.
The business advisers who were commissioned, however, highlight one weakness: In international interest-bearing trade, in the speech of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a great distance behind the largest banks.
UBS may have gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS decided to embark on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank and its venture capital fund were invested in U.S. investments Subprime.
It evolved into a massive machine that rolled over securities to U.S. mortgages and passed on — but also kept the risks to itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out.
“Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says banking expert Geiger.
How big the euphoria is, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when trying to clean up was more difficult than thought.
Positions at UBS have become a catapult seat and are still swinging today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
They need to find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
Banking expert Geiger already has an idea: End investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far.
But the investment banking industry is about to decline, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old was only seen as a temporary solution when the bank broke up with its predecessor, Grübel.
In the meantime, he pushed himself: He is to run UBS’s business in the long term, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3,500 seats cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who's her?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking.
In public, however, he says only that he and his mistress will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
The fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market.
The impending recession in Europe has stripped American investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended impact.

First of all, the financial values were on the sales notes.
The Dow-Jones Standard Values Index saw a 0.6 percent drop in trading at 12,078 points.
During trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broad-based S&P-500-Index ended at 1251 points, a decline of one percent.

In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a drop of 1.2 percent at 5,985 counters.
The industry in the 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the boom.
Businesses were producing 2 percent less in September than in the previous month, according to Eurostat.
“We are not an island, but an addict,” said Steve Goldman, Goldman’s manager.
Europe is not recovering so quickly from the recession, and there are other signs of banks’ weakness.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this outlook: He said in a CNBC interview that it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, it is probably too early from his point of view to invest in European state loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned a decades-old principle and entered the American technology industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM boosted the stock price of the traditional concern and let it first quote almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.

Smart Crows Are Spreading in Cities
In many places, field ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be expelled from cities, experts say.
Some people like them, others would like to get rid of them quite quickly: Crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, but in some villages complaints of pollution and noise caused by animals accumulate.
At the same time, there is not yet any means in sight against the "problem birds".
Field ravens can no longer be expelled from cities, experts said at the first symposium on crows in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible exits.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Conservationists also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravens: The use of chemistry in agriculture is probably increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing development and felling of typical nesting trees make life difficult for birds.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are located, among others, in Westphalia's Soest, in the northwest, among others, in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project of mass killing crows in a rural district triggered negative headlines.
Critics have labeled catching animals in bird traps and slaughtering sticks as particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, fear, brings nothing," said the urbanist and landscape designer Werner Klöver of Leer.
The removal of nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg said.
"Animals are retreating, large colonies are splitting and dividing into other places."
Fear is conceivable only as an exception in hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them out."
Without the surrounding territory, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
A combination of expelling animals from sensitive habitats and attracting them to settle elsewhere is conceivable.
The "information board instead of chainsaws" was promoted by the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens because of the completely different treatment of animals: "One custard in the face, in the end, we can best withstand self-confidence."
Mrs. Jürgens co-founded the Ascherberg Scientific Crow Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, on which information boards provide lessons about the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
In the meantime, the project has already been accepted by tourists.
Also on the criticism of the noise caused by birds, Mrs Jürgens had her own opinion: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: field ravens not only use tools to achieve a treat, but even make their tools as a tool.
Researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested behavior on four field ravens as far as bird intelligence goes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that the stones must cause the structure to collapse to get to the larvae of the pier.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape the stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the cunning crows then had to solve a more tedious problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with the larvae of the pier.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beak.
However, the researchers placed pieces of wire there.
From these she formed all four animals a hook, with the help of which, as a hook, she hunted the vessel by the handle from the pipe.
Three of the four field ravens even managed to do so with a stump.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal for the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for the cup did not come out.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the European Championship 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine in the Play-offs.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.) Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive European Championship match perfect after a 0:0 result in the first game.
The Czechs had enough in the play-offs with the outsider Montenegro result 1:0 (0:0), when the first match was a clear thing.
Croatia did not give the goal with 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland achieved a relaxed 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the Bundesliga Zvjezdan Misimovic changed penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) reduced twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already failed in the play-off matches for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a start to peace.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in long-range shooting and adjusted the 25-meter goal to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not perform in the first half hour, had their first clear chance in goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former Wolfsbury player from English at the head of the standing club Manchester City settled the ball with the head on the lower edge of the log, but the ball did not exceed the goal line (33).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
In the end, referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding stood at the centre.
After the operation against Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card.
On the opposite side, Stark made a controversial punitive kick after the Fabio Coentraa action, which Misimovic confidently transformed.
But after the break, everything was clarified by the European vice-champion of 2004 with four hits.
Petr Jiracek also finished his last doubts for the Czech Republic in the 81st minute.
With this, the 1976 European Champion is leaving for the fifth time in a row for the European Championships.
The team of coach Michal Bilko with the legionary of the Bundesliga Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1. FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second at the initial stage.
The goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech prevented a possible goalkeeper Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok at the last moment (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic fired in the 40th minute from the turn from the border of the criminal territory just around the goal of <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save the place of the already knocked down goalkeeper of the Czechs of the world class, again reducing the attacker FC Soul (50.).
Shortly before the end, Branka finally clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not exceed the state 0-0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to relax his place on the bench of the third in the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can rejoice at his fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
Before 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairytale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the pole in the seventh minute with a shot from a distance, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the rebound ball in the goal.
After this terrible second, Croatia took control, but to an ever greater extent.
Also after the break, the Croats did not get the goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, there were also legionnaires from the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championships since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who took care of the success 4:0 in the first match already for a preliminary decision, in the 32nd minute to the lead.
Konstantin Vassilyev (57.) settled for guests.
Ireland had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
It was only at the last minute that the Estonian defense prevented a possible goalkeeper.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After the unsuccessful defense of the goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was in place and pushed the ball across the line to the state of 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
SAP, Europe’s largest software maker, is investing billions in China over the next few years and is aiming to nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
Around $2 billion (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will flow by 2015, Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional R&D facilities and employ relevant staff,” Bill McDermott, the company’s deputy chief executive, said at the Beijing customer trade fair.
The workforce is now set to grow from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of the world’s leading companies in the field of enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s global more than 176,000 customers are in a booming country.
China’s growth plans are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorf community raised around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
Currently, the stores of the software manufacturer, which employs 55,000 employees worldwide, are running as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"We would now like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to promote sustained growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that will make your head spin.
One piece of advice on how to behave at this point: Carefully tear this page out and make a bookmark of it.
You will be very familiar with all the people in Mr. Englund's novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a kind of beacon - at times when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in various situations.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book we are discussing here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite appropriately, as an "anti-historical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists, as well as discussions about tactics and equipment.
It is not so much a book about what happened, the author explains, as rather a "book about what it was like". It is mainly about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the war experiences of 20 more or less dozen men and women, on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flicker like the flames of candles lit in a church - new ones are added to the tangle of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book differs from classic historical novels.
It rewrites the notion that the First World War was all about the horrific trenches fighting on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skilfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the fact that bee nests fall on them, they have to spend Christmas in the shadow of the pyramids or face the presence of tse-tse flies.
This is a very touching reading almost from the beginning.
War devours the lives of humans like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, which smells like gunpowder.
When gunfire begins to ring in the distance and you are the woman who is home with your children, will you run away or stay?
Who's actually coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on, not even why the whole war has been unleashed.
"The vacuum of lack of facts," said Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, conjectures, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmorough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are generally taken from biographies, letters and other materials already published.
The descriptions of their lives may sound frightening and engaging, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them talk about suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Substitutes, everywhere just substitutes."
"Coffee substitute, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It mentions "meat made from pressed rice cooked in sheepskin fat (and supplemented with fake bone from wood), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds his inner instincts for savagery and brutality, and then he declares about the war: "Finally, you will understand that this is human nature. Not sitting in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and whiskey, an evening newspaper or a good book, pretending that this mask of yours represents civilization and that there is no starch in it."
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely to die soon, and no one will even notice, let alone mourn.
“When one finally accepts that one is sacrificing oneself, one would at least expect that to happen in front of a grateful audience,” he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks concern the departure of old Europe and the onset of new horrors.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive struggle,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures what he calls “the new kind of beast of the coming century: an eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in a custom-made dress who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, meanness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch a sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front lines.
"The most grotesque example of this behavior was the trade in gonococcal pus, which the soldiers were buying and smashing their genitals with in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate rubbed it in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s prose is fast-paced, but not spectacular, which fits perfectly with his human theme.
In dozens of small outputs, it captures the way in which war has unleashed utterly uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I mostly worked with hints rather than complex narratives, such as Paul Fussell's "World War I and Modern Memories" or novels such as "On the Western Front Quiet" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most overwhelming endings that are unparalleled in popular scientific literature.
But I will not tell you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page out of your hero list and set it on fire.
After a previous error, this time per minute, a precisely scheduled
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some wearing helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
No one knew about the action except a few high-ranking officers, and the others were told at first that it was an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the head of the operation, and his presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and, moreover, the wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
Therefore, the police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park from the demonstrators was launched only after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive exercise for crisis behaviour took place in the part of Randalls Island, which was preparing for an event in Zuccotti Park.
Leaders have stepped up so-called riot control training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid movement of large numbers of police officers — with a focus on the Lower Manhattan metropolitan area.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute," someone said, to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise."
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this action, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"Only the highest-ranking members of the department knew that he was going to Zuccotti Park."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city had already learned.
On October 14, city officials planned to clean the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the demonstrators heard about it, hundreds of them gathered in the park before the operation began.
Tuesday's action was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area - dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that a large number of people come and go to the park during the day, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people as possible in the park," he said.
Before the troops set off, they lined up at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplifiers.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amplifiers frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the police force entered the park in their blue windbreakers, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say they did not touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering at the edge of the park so they could infiltrate it if arrests were to be made.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police chief spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing her troops in action, and in addition, some police officers were rude to them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the TV cars on Church Street running along the park’s western border could film without any problems.
The police were moving westward, intertwined with the crowded personal belongings of the protesters, including luggage and plastic bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately grabbed everything left in the park.
Some demonstrators, who refused to move, were pulled out of the park. Documentary imagery appeared shortly after on the Internet.
The most enthusiastic group of demonstrators took refuge in the vicinity of the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some have created a barrier, and the police have started their methodical arrests.
About ten people in the center of the camp tied to each other.
And two people tied themselves to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency services were called in to cut the locks.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests were due to "organizing riots and resisting arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the commander of the detectives in the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "did not participate in the operation's management," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of policemen waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it was necessary to call her.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, barriers were erected.
From these places, the police then developed a protective belt even further away from Zuccotti Park.
At one point, police officers, many of whom were equipped with shields, were seen pushing people further beyond this line.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The most savage action of the night took place south of the park.
Around five o’clock in the morning, one demonstrator south of Pine Street was seen jumping onto the hood of a police car, and several others leaking air from the tires of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for dismissal
Unions representing hundreds of school helpers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday, saying the layoffs were unnecessary and moreover discriminatory, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The trial is probably the last option left to the District Council 37 unions in their attempt to reverse the dismissal decision.
On 7 October, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parental coordinators and other employees, who were among the city's worst-paid employees, lost their jobs. Their dismissal was described by union leaders as a retribution of the city for not allowing it access to a labor-controlled health care fund last spring, with which the city wanted to glue into the city.
City officials categorically denied the accusation.
At a town council meeting last month, Education Minister Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget approved in June.
One member of the council immediately countered by saying that the budget did not specifically mention the dismissal of auxiliary workers.
Representatives of the district of District Council 37 announced that they had already filled out the necessary documents and warned the Ministry of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will convene a press conference, where they will formally announce the lawsuit at the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The defendants in the trial will be Mr Walcott and the Ministry of Education, while the plaintiffs will be eight redundant workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would therefore not comment on the individual charges.
According to a draft complaint obtained by the New York Times, unions focused on the number of people released in poor parts of the city to back up their claims of unfair behavior, arguing that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have long been denied sufficient funding.
They point out that while there were no redundancies in the schools in Staten Island and only minimal redundancies in the Upper East Side, in Brooklyn, 17 school assistants were lost in District 23 in Brownsville, and 46 assistants in District 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, even though it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty.
The budget of Public School 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds were calculated for every poor student enrolled.
The unions argue, among other things, that high school principals may have been confused by the way in which the document authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators was written.
In the document, the word "excess" was used to describe the action, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school payroll to the database of available employees whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint draft says, "and not just moved to the database as available staff."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept the agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, Republicans and Democrats in Congress seem to agree on something about the uprising in Libya.
But before that, the revolution had to succeed, long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the involvement of U.S. troops ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Commission will decide on a statement backed by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate Libyans on their successful uprising and thank U.S. troops for their "courage".
"With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the Libyan people who have started rebuilding their country," Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above-mentioned sentences may seem innocent, but no debate concerning Libya has hitherto been easy.
Over the summer, lawmakers from both sides have repeatedly argued with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States’ military role in NATO’s mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of the differing views of both political parties, so it was never even voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures that would stop funding US operations in Libya.
This put the U.S. mission in Libya literally in legislative purgatory — Congress criticized President Obama’s handling of the mission, but it obviously didn’t irritate its members enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The hesitation of the Congress was finally preceded by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Commission “congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people” and “praises the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their allies who have taken part in the operation to protect the Libyan population, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The statement also "reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal get the full support of the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be re-divided into two halves, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indian), the main representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that would require a balanced budget, which should be the highest legislative priority for almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, promoted by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first amendment to the Constitution on a budget or other topic to be voted on by the entire House or Senate.
For the time being, the other legislators, despite considerable efforts, have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the vote itself.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just minor variations of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of a balanced budget amendment and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents - especially novice Republicans who want to improve their reputation - can boast of their "authority".
The decree on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on the amendment on the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding statement in support of the creation of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss limiting the number of periods during which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that can be president.
Deputy Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a variety of supplements that would, among other things, guarantee the right to quality education and medical care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage and an amendment banning the burning of the national flag remains a permanent proposal.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress appear to be very active in drafting various amendments, they do not differ significantly from the average in comparison with previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 amendments, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales compared to the early 1990s, when, according to statistics from the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 allowances every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th Amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Striked, but not defeated," Gifford says in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being injured by a shooter in a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing along with a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and declaring that more than a return to Congress was worth it.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer, and it was seen that making sentences was still a problem for her, and she needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary because of a bullet wound that pierced her skull in front, penetrated the left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured 13 others, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - describing her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, "Very well."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special for the 20/20 series, which aired on the eve of the couple’s new book, Gabby: A Tale of Courage and Hope.
Special's been watching Gifford's entire recovery since the January 8 shooting.
The videos, shot by Kelly during the first week, show Giffords in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, he can’t do more than lift one or two fingers.
A few months later, Giffords is captured sitting in a wheelchair, and her therapists teach her how to perform simple activities.
A nod of his head.
Lip swells.
And then, her first word, "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" - when she demanded a change in her breakfast.
The ABC videos show that music played a pivotal role in Giffords' recovery: the Congresswoman sang along with a melody therapist to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During the interview, Gifford, who devotes two hours a day to therapy, revealed to Sawyer that she remembers nothing from the day the shooting occurred.
Her husband said that Gifford read the newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who had been killed in the incident were.
The shooter is Jared Lee Loughner, who is detained in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Horrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point his wife said during the convalescence, "I lost."
"So I told her right away, 'Gabby, you didn't lose, 'Kelly said.
"You just got a kick out of it.
But you can do it, you can get back together, and you can come back stronger than ever.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than respect.
The event was a gala night on Wall Street that brought in millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who have no roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines gathered around him.
The ceremonially dressed crowd rose and applauded enthusiastically.
“The men and women serving in the military were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the Spring Benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units somewhat differently, the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee also attended the ceremony.
"They were all presented as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers meant it well.
I know you do.
But what I saw wasn't respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the often measured, sometimes glorifying American public.
The army is indiscriminately included in the praise of its victims.
But this praise is worth something, say the soldiers.
Increasingly, the public acts as if they feel sorry for the individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive for military commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relations with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most words of regret are spoken in silence and in private among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations, where they served as Marines, their father warned them that their service would be viewed from two angles.
From the point of view of some, they will feel respect and wonder, as they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will wonder if “there is an evil, violent veteran hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took a seat in Washington’s government on his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some people who interviewed him were inconspicuously suggesting that he could withstand the stress of working in Washington so soon after returning from combat.
"When you talk about your service, you have to expect negative reactions," Cancian told his sons.
The military’s concern stems in part from America’s indifference to war.
Success on the battlefield is rarely recognized in a country that has little knowledge of its own army and finds little self-interest in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we did during World War II,” said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, recognition by politicians and the public focuses mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to crack down on rape.
This week, it will be decided whether to start a trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the case of rape.
If not, they are ready to file a lawsuit against hundreds of other applicants.
The first-class soldier, Elizabeth Lyman, was 25 years old on the night she was allegedly raped by her military colleague and was 11 weeks pregnant.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at Miramar Air Force Base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend, she bumped into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him, if they could have a drink in her room.
"I've got a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, No, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just minutes after they entered her room, the man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other existing or former members of the military will await a verdict of a hearing that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be brought before the court.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiffs had 17 members at the time, but over the following months their number grew to 28 to 25 women and three men, all of whom claimed to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their colleagues in the military and that the army failed to investigate, punish and prosecute any charges.
Burke says she's going after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
“The military is a directive system,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to prevent efforts to put in place measures against such acts?
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than grouping all the accusations into this case — stacking all the eggs in one basket, she says — she’ll file lawsuits in multiple different cases, if necessary, so that the pressure doesn’t ease.
The Defense Department’s defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who together with his associates filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek discuss in detail the strategy of the defense - in principle, the fact that current or former soldiers can not sue the army for injuries suffered as members of the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court order called Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
However, things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of wordplay: in modern wars it is difficult to find a clearly defined front line.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers have played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: between these wars, 150 female soldiers fell - two-thirds of them directly in combat.
The time has come for modernization in the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, except for three other attorneys.
At Yale Law School, visitors to a veterans’ seminar on legal services are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere fostering hatred for women.
Independently, a non-profit organization of U.S. veterans is gathering evidence for its lawsuit against the military. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorders" that were allegedly found in rape victims so that the army had an excuse to release them - according to activists such as Anu Network Ahagwati's rights include
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against a state organization for dealing with veterans, accusing her of discriminatory practices that should have taken place when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate motions were presented to Congress by a group of senators and lawmakers from both political parties, proposing a number of corrective measures.
According to the Department of Defense’s Office for the Prevention and Management of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains largely unreported, and according to Pentagon estimates, the number corresponds to about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The March report also discusses the degree of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported in the military were brought to justice – half of the civilian justice system.
Prosecutors in the case of Deputy Burke describe the attacks as only the first of a number of traumas.
First-class soldier Lyman, for example, reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it was due to take place.
During the night, she was asked to repeat details of her rape eleven times to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the examinations necessary to determine the rape, and the blood of the assailant was found in her bed - from the wound she had done on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman underwent a court hearing during which she was asked questions about whether she had made love to her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people were summoned to testify as witnesses to the rumor in favour of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was handed down," Lyman said.
"I felt like I was going to give birth right there on the spot - screaming I ran out of the courtroom."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember telling my commanding officer, 'It wasn't his trial. It was mine.'"
The Lymans ordered a visit to a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, calling her ineligible for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without the right to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other prosecutors moves to the next stage or not, it’s a long run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of the discussion."
But between them and the verdict stands the doctrine, which has been criticized since the first moment it saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because their responsibilities do not allow for the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are tough against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change will only happen if good people are willing to fight.
In the absence of a decision in their favour, Burkevo<0xC3><0xA1>, the plaintiff’s lawyer, will gather hundreds of other persons prepared to file a lawsuit and will begin working on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting the army on this issue where there will be no reform," he said.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Examining You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man who presented his anti-immigrant views on the Internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July killing rage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: during the preparation of the attack, he spent a lot of time at the computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After the tragedy of this summer, scientists want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t really that hard,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
Facebook’s stock of personal information is so vast, Bartlett says, that scientists just needed to simply use the ads on the site to pinpoint the demographics they were looking for—something marketing professionals have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe, focusing on them and sending them ads, but instead of inviting them to the newly formed group or offering them some dietary products, they were asked to fill out a questionnaire on their own regarding the level of violence and their relationship to education.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to get results from more than 10,000 fans of 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without ever having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are generally young men who are stoked by rising immigration rates.
But on the other hand, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind a computer screen.”
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and policy researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding state updates, wall posts, and “Like” buttons.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. On average, each of them will provide three different data per day, which makes this social network literally an "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works in whose name the word Facebook occurs has increased compared to five years ago to almost 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the opportunity to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
“It used to be that when you wanted to do a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
"You'd have to get to a side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
“Facebook is breaking up all of this – you’re just going straight to them.”
Others claim that the site can offer a way to identify and avoid a social health problem.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, a research team found that university students who discussed their drinking outcomes on Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that students' peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who publishes too many drunken statuses.
"The problem cannot be solved unless you can diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Dr. Moreno's Washington Post and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify endangered children that we would otherwise not have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself constantly probes the data of its users.
The site’s information team has compiled statistics on the relationship between the relationship status and Valentine’s Day, the 2010 voter turnout and the nation’s satisfaction coefficient (mainly using the information they had access to – advocates of internet freedom have long argued that the site should make its information treasure accessible to research and others).
But Facebook users know that the site is following them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, you need to provide the site with your personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules on how to collect data offline, but online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users even thought that scientists could look at their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they were concerned, they took it that the information was only between them and their friends."
It is also necessary to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
It is not possible to verify on Facebook how much of the information on the profile and posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent many years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook continue to be the best tool that can be used in research.
“When you go out into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” she says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still taking place offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public trial
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "rebel" during his first public hearing in Oslo.
“I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Knights Templar,” he told the court, where 500 people gathered.
“I object to the court because you have been mandated by organizations that support hate ideology and because they support multiculturalism.”
"I confess my actions, but I do not confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform from which to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 weeks, and announced that the competent authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
They all took part to move the case to an early closure.
"I thought he looked cold and inhumane," one of the attack's survivors told a NRK commentator.
"It wasn't pleasant, but I can say for myself that after seeing and hearing the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. When coming and going to the building without difficulty, the journalists present and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge said he was not insane, noting that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
For some, it may be comforting that the June 22 attacks seem to be the work of a single extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the sorrows and confusions that are still in the minds and hearts of the whole nation.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not," said a relative of one of the victims.
"If it were, everything would be much simpler."
7 Lessons from a Lost Conversation with Steve Jobs in a Movie Going to the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to emerge - and they elected him as his genius The Greatest Modern Inventor.
At Jobs’s recently rediscovered interview, which was dusted for a special film heading to the movies this week, it will be for all Apple fans the fact that his creative mind perfectly understood the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedant organizer and a person who fine-tuned every little detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer from "the idea that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work ... [but] between a great idea and a great result product is still a long way to go."
In 1995, Bob Cringely worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Fools, which dealt with the dawn of personal computers. During the filming, a unique, more than an hour-long interview took place.
It’s been ten years since Jobs was forced to leave Apple, and he’s had his hands full with his new computer company, NeXT, and eagerly awaited the general public’s acceptance of the internet.
In the end, only a short part of Cringely's entire interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs' death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
This material, slightly trimmed, forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is heading to selected cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is notorious for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs is surprisingly enthusiastic about talking about his technology philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful person.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when you can see how Jobs thinks through the answer perfectly, to make it as concise and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he acts impatiently on Cringely’s questions and pushes him to get to more important problems and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod, or iPhone, and features terrifyingly prophetic thoughts as Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong, while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read the post-mortem reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as an eager dreamer in the heyday of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things could and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had spoken his ideas, he also began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of the seven scenes from the Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
“Throughout the years of business, I’ve always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same, ‘Well, that’s how it’s done.’”
No one knows why he does what he does, never thinks deeply about business-related things.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
He was completely confused by the way the costs were recorded - they often began with the inscription "standard costs", the amount of which he could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that ensured that they could determine the business costs in a moment.
How he made the barn on the pope:
Jobs recalls the “Blue Box” he built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
Many have been written about this device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm for describing the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
It tells how Wozniak and they tested the devices using a pay phone and switched from one AT&T network to another while using as many satellites as possible.
“We’ve been around the world at least half a dozen times, so when we shouted something on the pay phone, it came a minute later from the second phone at the door,” Jobs laughs.
“We were young and we found that we could build a thing ourselves that could run billions of dollars’ worth of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a little thing that could control a much bigger giant - it was an incredible experience and I don't think Apple would ever have come into existence without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke that Wozniak and I almost finished. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, while posing as best they could as Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to talk to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and just before they woke the Pope himself to the phone, the pair quivered and put the phone down.
How he fell in love with technology (and made a phone call with Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old and was looking for spare parts to build a counter, he found Bill Hewlett's number in his phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how it should treat its employees.
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a CRT monitor and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager at HP, I progressed higher and higher, hanging around that computer and started writing programs for it.
How to invent innovation:
In several places, Jobs talks about how he invents new products while running.
At the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of printed circuit boards, one customer asked him to assemble a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalls the challenges they faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember we had a pretty wild fight... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] to stop having fun, so I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to make a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies get their breath away:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs foretold that many industry leaders would waver in their vision and lose their market share.
“Let’s say you work for IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what next?”
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At this point, sales and marketing are already in power, so companies are run by people who are in charge of just that, while people in charge of their own products are pushed out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products - skill and technical knowledge are essential.
That's exactly what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could literally own the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times bigger than it was, it could have been Microsoft in the 1990s.
Instead of winning, they lost.
How to use innovation as an art form:
“Between a great idea and a great result, there’s still a long way to go and a lot of work to do... and as that great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
During this time, you will learn a lot about him.
You have to make a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force.
You have to keep 5,000 things in mind all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
In the end, it depends on taste – you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in a certain way you try to reflect them into what you do yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I've never been ashamed to steal the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, coincidentally, also the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would have done amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the health care law at a time when their case was being dealt with by a court
On the day the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether to accept objections to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by a law firm to attend the trial.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the motions filed.
One of the cases discussed was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of healthcare that Congress passed last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, which will further fuel the 2012 presidential election, which will be in full swing at the time of the ruling.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as the Attorney General of the United States under George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been advocating conservative legal principles for years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after a court hearing on the case.
It was attended, among others, by Mitch McConnell, the Republican Supreme Representative in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And introducing guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: The pair of judges have been participating in the events of the Federalist Society for years.
There is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are relieved of the obligation to observe the principles of conduct to which lower federal judges are subject.
However, if this were not the case, their conduct would definitely fall under principle C4, which states that "a judge may participate in events that are currently organized by related and other organizations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge must not be a speaker, an honorary guest, or be listed on the program of the event."
Yet the relationship between Scalia and Thomas to the two law firms involved in the case, as well as the company with a huge financial interest in the case, was abundantly enough to alarm activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to code of conduct is contrary to the assertion by several judges that the Supreme Court is acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause.
“The judges drank and ate dinner at the social benefit together with the attorneys waiting to hear their case in court.”
Their presence and assistance in raising funds through this action undermines the legs with all the claims of disinterest, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and told them that they also easily combined their judicial duties with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-ranking conservative activist.
In addition, conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly with Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan served as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared in court.
Kagan's critics pressure her to renounce her involvement in the case, claiming that she fought for the law as much as she could now be unbiased.
Kagan did not suggest that she was going to step down.
Boeing wins record-breaking $18 billion contract for jet aircraft
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 of its products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
But if the company is Boeing Co. and the price of these 50 aircraft is a record $18 billion, that’s something else.
Equally important news is where Boeing got the order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history this weekend regarding the dollar value for commercial aircraft - 50 twin-aisle jet Boeing 777s.
The deal came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
At the 2011 Dubai Air Show, Boeing said airlines had the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the order to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel consumption and passenger facilities.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
“This is excellent news for the entire Boeing company,” said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"The quality of these particular customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
This means that not only do they have money to pay for planes, but the rise in fuel prices - mostly damaging to airlines because it is one of its biggest costs - is not so decisive, because the country itself makes money from higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to higher fuel prices, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates strengthens Boeaing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS to the fore as it tries to undermine Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the first flight of its largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER.
The delay was because customers demanded more payload and range, so the manufacturer took the time to give the machine more engine power.
The price of Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Defeated in Michigan Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Fausto Vallejon of PRI, was aided in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug traffickers.
The sister of Felipe Calderon appears to have lost in the violent state elections for the post of governor in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n. On Monday, she announced that one of her opponents had been helped to win by drug traffickers.
Preliminary results attributed the leadership in the governorship elections of the Western state to Faust Vallej by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
“The involvement of members of organised crime in the entire electoral process, and especially in yesterday’s election itself, is alarming not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for our entire country,” Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s election.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the polling group... confiscated polling booths, built roadblocks... and let people vote on demand for PRI.
The PRI party ruled Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost its presidency.
However, he is planning an early return to power, and winning the election in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have defeated Calderon, who was still running the day before the election, only very tightly.
Calderon, a candidate for the Conservative Party of her brother the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejon as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the leftist Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), which until now controlled the governor's office. For the dissenting and unfortunate persecuted party, it is a very unfortunate loss before the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognise the preliminary results as valid.
Vallejo, a former mayor of the state capital named Morelia, rejects any relationship with drug traffickers and encourages other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon, and it was in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n that he launched a military fight against traffickers in December 2006.
But the violence persisted.
The mayor of PAN, a supporter of Luisa Maria Calderon, was murdered just a week before the election, and many of the candidates resigned out of fear.
But no matter how the results of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n election look to the PRI party, the victory will help the party gain a new impetus.
Enrique Pena Nieto, the PRI’s expected representative in the presidential election, congratulated Wahington Valley and said: “I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year.”
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be an overall decline in the world economy, which would also have a negative impact on the growth of economies in Asia.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help speed the recovery of the currency bloc through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the Bric countries [Brazil, Russia, India, China] were watching all European troubles "too unexcited" and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, would help to reverse the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they definitely should."
The European Monetary Association has been experiencing a severe debt crisis for several months now.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously, and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have stepped down.
Europe’s growing debt crisis has raised concerns that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and calls have begun to come up for the emerging leading economies to unite and help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union's Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Institution - would provide greater negotiating opportunities for Asian partners in European countries.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a decline in exports and a drying out of foreign capital inflows.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless,” he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high growth rate."
“It’s not an alternative, it’s a bare fact, because how else could we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that emerging economies such as India have nothing to help European economies when forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to explain Europe’s help to India’s 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live from $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and enjoy their holidays on the beaches, which would be hard to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, director general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian supplies should be used to maintain well-paid employment for many Greek citizens in poorly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis threatens a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank's forecast that there will be 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 is now facing a "downside risk" due to the European threat.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets must create "unpredictable spending plans" to protect them from falling and a significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Cuts in Defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday in Congress rigged the cauldron, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could endanger national security and trigger a financial chain reaction beginning at the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefield in Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend $450 billion on budget cuts over the next ten years, but is now worried about another $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’ inability to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called imposition would cause a 23% flat-rate decline and the halting of many new projects.
"Because of such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or shipbuilding projects - you can't buy just three quarters of a building or a ship, and there could be serious damage to other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote.
"We will also be forced to separate many of our civilian staff, and since the cuts are to take place so quickly, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
“These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our military and seriously damage its readiness.”
In the end, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta said.
“Although the accounts for financing possible overseas war operations will not be directly affected by this standstill, the operations there will be adversely affected by major changes in other budgets,” Panetta said.
“There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in a delay in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people.”
“The state of paid employees will be reduced, resulting in late payments to suppliers and subsequent breaches of legal and political support.”
Both senators wrote Panett ten days ago and asked him for details about the possible impact on automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
“The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause a rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power.”
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon, when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
“It will only be seen if Panett’s letter and fresh warnings increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and strengthen the voices calling for the Pentagon to be omitted from the list of crippled areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open in recent talks about possible cutbacks, even as he moved to his senior position at the Pentagon with years of experience in budget approval in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was getting into a tough fight.
At a press conference held a minute week, the defense minister outlined a brief picture of what his resort might expect - an army shell, but inside it will be missing the core.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"It'll be like a brigade without ammo."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
“He will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission,” Panetta said.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to cope with a possible enemy."
"As a result, it will welcome aggression..."
In an annex delivered with a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, Panetta specified how the reduction would result in "significant operational risks: late responses to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant reductions in landing and deployment capabilities around the world; anticipated unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the largest defense projects could wait to be completed, including those that are already being tested, and those that are still in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, the design of the F35, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marines wanted to replace the humvees.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its proponents say it is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to Recognize a Lie
A glimpse of recent newspaper headlines suggests how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy accusing him of sexually molesting several women - both sides claiming the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of perjury when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught running a microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie has been able to destroy entire careers and cloak the stability of many countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of misusing finances from his campaign to try to cover up his illegitimate relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that rallied around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
There are stories of cheating at school and university.
There are cases when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to look good in their reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and deceit are acceptable.
How many scams do we face?
Studies show that in one day you lie somewhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first encounter.
Determining lies, or "recognition of lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
But it's not a social game that's similar to, say, Sharada, when one shouts, "I got you." Deception recognition is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities during detailed research projects, especially in the field of psychology and philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
The liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're squirming, they're cocktailing, they're blushing, or they're sewing.
However, do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot the liars and expose them.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from the sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years collecting scientific knowledge from a vast and growing industry related to the recognition of lies, and it is clear that the detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and can help you a lot in today's complex world - especially if your job responsibilities include hiring, conducting interviews, negotiating or leading people.
Good liars are able to read well in others, let them relax in vigilance, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other side accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more "self-centered" lies, while women tell more lies "focused on others" - mostly to protect one's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than single people (but the lies they say are usually "relentless").
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called “initial observation.”
Thanks to him, he will have a later find out what to compare with.
Notice the body posture of the subject, his laughter, work with the voice.
You should know if someone is routinely tapping their feet so you don’t unduly accuse them of lying just because they start tapping their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to identify clusters of false verbal and non-verbal behavior.
But consider it only as a warning signal, not as proof of a lie.
People telling lies can stop moving their upper half of the body when trying to remember their fictional story, they can turn their shoe tips to the door, lean toward the exit, significantly change their posture, or show "relief after the end of the conversation" - exaggerated relief breathing and changing position when it is difficult to confess them.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, just to see what the relief will look like after it is over.
Notice the subject’s language as well.
The famous story is about how Scott Peterson once renounced and used the past tense to claim that his murdered wife was alive, which sparked a nationwide search for her body.
Deceiving individuals can also express themselves in a measured way: “I had no sexual relationship with that lady... Miss Lewinsky” or repeat the difficult question all over again.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "softening language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to the best of my knowledge."
In such a response, we do not know much of the facts, and often this is another warning signal.
There is no magic by which every lie can be revealed, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which a lie can be traced.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of not hitting a liar and a cheater in his personal and professional life.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be redirected after the threat of delaying approval by the US government
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico — which has pitted unions against each other but calmed environmentalists — the company in charge of building the pipeline announced it was willing to redirect the project to get things moving again.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move the planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved anyway.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Nebraska government.
TransCanada’s Alex Pourbax column says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the foreign ministry announced last week that it was postponing a decision to federally authorize the project, from where it would not carry out studies of possible alternative routes that would avoid interfering with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
“This is really a step forward,” Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
A new environmental assessment commissioned by the State Department would likely postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the next year’s elections, but authorities have denied any political role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a request from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
700,000 barrels of oil flow from Alberta to refineries in Texas every day.
Six countries will need to be crossed this way.
The project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by the work force, which estimates that 20,000 new jobs will be created while working on the pipeline.
Legislators in Nebraska, however, opposed the plan and considered enforcing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the State Department found that the project would have only a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the ministry’s inspector general had ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
One was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s advisor in 2008, was not a conflict of interest on the agenda.
Next, whether the company that was hired for the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had links to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of throwing up her toddler fears
The New York family claims that singer Patti LaBelle broke into the lobby of their Manhattan home and scared their daughter to throw up with fear.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan's Supreme Court.
On November 10 last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk delivered the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their house in Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' I said yes and I left to pick her up."
LaBelle reprimanded the pregnant woman irritably.
"She told me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care about your opinion.'"
She became furious and began to speak foully - shouting out loud the most foul expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she began to draw water from it.
He claims that Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother - who still had Genevieve in her arms - and had to stop her until her escort dragged her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Her daughter was screaming so much that she threw up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter requesting an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokespersons are not responding to our calls to comment on the case.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified compensation, but the family’s attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The purpose is to force Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a schoolteacher holding an 18-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change slows down the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment and the economy declined with it.
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, which itself is called the government of change. This government brought with it high expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth and even a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
Low February temperatures have caused millions of losses in agriculture, limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, they are responsible for a decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first semester of this year. In the field of agriculture, there was a historical decline by 31.16%, which disrupted the dynamics of other economic sectors.
According to the damage report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78.03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07% was found to be partial damage. The main crops destroyed include vegetables, corn and peas.
The decline in economic activity until November caused a constant increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased by 68% and increased by 68%. From January to March, 55,053 residents of the state of Sinaloa were unemployed, which represents an unemployment rate of 4.53% with the economically active population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate in the state increased.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, based on the steps taken at the public policy level.
“We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. These include, among others, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints due to legislation approved by Congress in connection with the fight against money laundering. For people who illegally seize dollars, it is not easy to earn them, invest them or use them for something,” he said.
Stopping migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that the demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people leaving for work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and then because even when these people get abroad, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and thus unemployment increases," he said.
Unreliability
The labour market analysis in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the area of working conditions. According to the National Institute of Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the state's employed population works without paying social security benefits.
Other features of the labour market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative area, the lowest salaries are from across the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas by September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of foreign direct investment
Along with a decline in economic activity and an increase in unemployment, foreign direct investment fell sharply in the last 10 years. According to the Ministry of Finance, between January and June, foreign direct investment amounted to $630,697, representing a decrease of 87.74% compared to $5,143,312 for the same period in the previous year.
On the other hand, the Ministry for Economic Development of the Government of the State has reported investments in the amount of 17,280 million pesetas per year.
Debt
In connection with the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the state Congress in July to approve a loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be earmarked for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress approved a loan of 2,600 million pesos. By November, no gains were recorded in the economy and no debt was recorded.
Reactions
According to representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés, pointed to the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, chairman of the National Chamber of Transformative Industries, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We have to work intensively to regain the land we lost this year. In 2012, we have to double our efforts, there was a lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and, in particular, the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government. Let's hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Slowing down the economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frost. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to regain the dynamism that would allow to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services. Therefore, at the end of the year we found ourselves well below the expected forecasts," he said.
Re-defining the mission
According to Theodore Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed to more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we observe that work is underway. We believe that a long-term plan should be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state would be redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources Sinaloa has be mobilized," he said.
The work that is before us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the government's efforts.
“In general, I would say that the government has tried to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,” he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be friendly. I can say that there is work done here and I believe that the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Sentenced to 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic reported that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted of a health-threatening crime, namely possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was apprehended by the Mexican army on 7 June 2010 while walking on Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a pick-up van of white color. He had a black bag in the car on the shelf and a small backpack on the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judge of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Realisation of the Legal Effects of Crimes.
Contributions to projects
Social projects, which are part of programmes such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for migrants, face the risk that they will not be pulled to an end or that they will be greatly delayed due to a lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda said.
The director of urban social development said that if the construction works have progressed so far, now the government threatens to be unable to secure the corresponding deliveries, which require funds of more than 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He stated that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. By this time, only the Federation and the city provided funds for work, so it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They have to provide almost 12 million, and even though the year is coming to an end, we did not get anything at all. And even though we should have received a part already in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we started the projects and they continue very successfully, but we lack the money."
He said that during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla last year, the state failed to meet the relevant deliveries, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan in order to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. In order to get to the mentioned programs this year, we had to get funds to cover what the state did not complete," he explained.
Despite a promise from state officials to hand over these resources, he said a request was sent to Armando Villarreal, the secretary of administration and finance, to speed up the proceedings and get the corresponding percentages as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million and even though the year is coming to an end, we haven’t got a peso yet.”
Court Approves 'End of Analogue Broadcasting' in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has experienced in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) has rejected a constitutional complaint filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which wants to speed up the so-called "off analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021. He noted that there were no necessary eight votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his authority when he issued a decree outlining the individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was dismissed because the qualified majority of eight votes needed for the court to comment on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, which thus remains valid, was not achieved.
The draft judgment prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all issues related to radio and television is a matter reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and exceptions to the law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an effort to fight the decree. Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all actions described in it, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also in charge of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he does not agree with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure measures to prepare public administration through general standards.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he said, recalling that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of the radioelectric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying the change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires decisions on matters of public interest, because digitalisation does not only have a technical dimension, but also "affects economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these questions "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a whole range of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the hands of the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world had already completed the transition to the digital system through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said that it was not possible for the government to introduce into the administration, by issuing a dissenting decree, which to some extent interfered with the powers of Congress, compliance with laws prepared by the legislature.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, they analyze the possibility of counting "voice after voice"
According to data published by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the election of the governor is less than 27 percent. 879 votes from 6074 constituencies have not yet been counted.
The vote-by-vote option appeared in this year's Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n elections, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second places in the governor's election is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted 879 votes out of a total of 6074 constituencies.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the Electoral Authority approved a number of measures that should harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be further recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Electoral Justice Act, because the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force was due to expire in this election period, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted their
On November 9, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms "invalid and illegal" because it has no right to "neither approve nor veto".
Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal, when asked about the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" census, replied that the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the IEM would make it possible for the partial and total census to be carried out by the local electoral body.
In this way, partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and calculation in the relevant field or the President does not have it at his disposal; or if there have been errors and obvious violations of election results.
In addition, an overall recount of votes in all ballot boxes will be possible if there is evidence that the difference between a potential election winner and a candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; each time an explicit request from a representative of the party and/or coalition that nominated the candidate in second place appears at the beginning of the session.
A total recount of votes will also be possible if, after a proper countdown, it is found that the difference between the likely winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request from a political party whose candidate ended in second place. In this case, ballots for which a partial recount was made will be eliminated.
It should be noted that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 constituencies have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Zapalinama, the family confirmed.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. On Monday, a solemn ceremony and a snooze mass will be held.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish was to have his ashes dispersed in the Zapalinama Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortése returned to the capital Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force plane.
At noon, the lieutenant-colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel on the Nazario Ortiz Garza Avenue, where his family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony took place at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and his wish was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapalinama Mountains. That's how he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, he was at the height of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo very young and joined the Colegio del Aire Aire School in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he even drove a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "he barely came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan for his uncle's graduation, so he is convinced that he died while doing what he loved most in his life: flying.
They gave him the last farewell
With Felipe Bacio Cortés, lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to all the honors that came to him to give Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the High School of Technology in Saltilo.
Bacio Cortés died in recent days after the helicopter he was driving crashed. On board was also the Secretary of the government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of the state.
At 18:05, the remains of Saltillan native Bacio Cortés (incinerated) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, in the area where his family, his daughter Amanda and wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers had gathered.
Three Abandoned Dead Body Found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in this area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting at different parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farm in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery took place on a 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of an area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cabin with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the authorities.
One person wore a yellow T-shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him, a man also lay in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three were lying face down.
According to local data, all three people were probably killed elsewhere because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the cottage were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime of the other, as well as a number of traces of bullets, both on the building and on the door.
In Cadereyta detained 11 suspects
The secretary of the National Defense presented 11 people, including teenagers, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnappings, murders, persecution and illegal burial.
According to information published on the first attempt on November 11 in the colony of Los Alveros, eight people were arrested and one person was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured and confirmed to be members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
On November 12, at 6 a.m., military personnel were on a tour in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta, when they noticed a car without a license plate and two people in it.
After stopping the car, they conducted a search and found one rifle, a shell casing and 18 rounds.
Then, on the basis of these testimonies, one of the accomplices in the La Frauda area was arrested on 13 November at about 2 p.m., and when he saw the soldiers, he tried to escape.
They were charged with illegal burials in the municipalities of General Ter<0xC3><0xA1>n, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that holds the country over the abyss of economic disaster.
Appointed Prime Minister Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian president to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that holds the country over the abyss of economic disaster that has put the entire eurozone at risk.
The palace issued a report announcing that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
It is expected to represent a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," he told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The framework is now well-marked," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight the political and financial crisis, which has caused the amount of debt to rise to an unsustainable level.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve the tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore Italy's shattered credibility.
Due to the instability of the markets, interest on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity exceeded the 7% limit, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailouts.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Italy’s Confindustria Employers Association, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last option for Italy to get out of this flammable situation.
Monti's hopes of success have increased significantly thanks to PDL support from Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign by the crisis on Saturday.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts are predetermined for good results,” Angelina Alfano, a centre-right party secretary, told reporters.
Support for the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far a number of its members have opposed a government with a technocratic majority composed of Monti.
Support for Parliament
Monti’s new government must have strong support from parliament to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any obstacle or delay in an effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has joined the pressure and warns that Monti’s failure could mean disaster.
On Monday, Monti opened talks with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women's organizations.
The round ends on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, who allowed a very rapid response to the crisis.
After a brief drop from the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond interest returned to a critical line, responding to uncertainty about whether the new prime minister would reap success.
Saving Italy, whose public debt amounts to 1.8 trillion euros, would be beyond the reach of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next election, which is scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will only give him time to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that the government must be composed only of experts to get Italy out of the difficulties the country has come into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to integrate political figures into the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Of the 22 Spanish footballers, 10 will cross the line of 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one out of 22 eligible players has reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare the 22 players of both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one on FIFA’s monthly rating, have a wide range of A-Class midfield matches on their account, Costa Rica has only Michael Uman, the only defender to have played 50 international matches.
This number reached last Friday in a match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez stadium.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Stars Match and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, have maintained intense activity for over a year at league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within European cups such as the Champions League.
We must also add to the previous experience of the Spanish national team in the complicated knockout matches for the European and World Championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the region. For example, there is Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has on his account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (lose 0-1 in London) reached former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will also face Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the key player of Barcelona, has 106 matches on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially announced last week by UEFA along with other Spanish players who have a hundred matches on their account, among them the already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close with 97 games.
They are followed by Xabi Alonso with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rican side and close to Michael Uman, the left wing J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
In addition, only 5 have surpassed the limit of 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
Minimum number of matches.
With less than 30 games in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31) play.
On the national side with less than 30 games stands Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first match.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of 20 years of existence
“The Costa Rican road is a dream that becomes a reality.”
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
This is what bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil, said.
The group is on the South American continent as part of a tour to celebrate 20 years of existence and will be at a unique stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
He will perform at the National Stadium at 7:30 p.m., alongside the angelic band The X and national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is an example of an interview whose full transcript can be found on La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n's website.
For your Costa Rican fans, this is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
Traveling to Costa Rica is a dream that is becoming a reality.
In South and Central America, we are barely a second time and the experience so far has been great.
I've only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I believe we'll be able to stay here for a few days.
So we're very happy to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally adore the group here, fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your most loyal supporters?
Thank you for standing by us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have been done over the course of a few weeks.
We did some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope to get in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we like to surf, we like the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tours, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no limits on what we can't do.
We will try to show the best show with various songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and introduce our fans to a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's wrong?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’re going to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven’t played in a long time, we focus on them and we’re also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I think it's more interesting for people as well.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic career.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, I'm sure you are.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we were going to be in one big rock band and that we were going to stay in it for more than 20 years.
We are aware of how much we have been given and we are touched that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We are lucky to be able to look at the places we have always wanted.
We couldn't have done better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the creation of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group where the greats themselves are represented.
People from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
Surprisingly, when a movement emerges from a group of friends, it doesn’t happen very often.
From time to time, a group will form in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to emerge from one city at a time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we still play with some.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored to be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stick together and still have the same members after all these years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think, firstly, we are all lucky to be still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are always interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends, and thanks to this, we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We believe in each other, we appreciate each other’s music, and I think it couldn’t have been better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew, it became increasingly easier to find balance.
We try not to go on tour too much, because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people came for music, you will remember that you have to respect music and what you gave it. You must not let yourself be carried away by being famous, rock stars. None of us ever really cared about this.
What do you think of Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote great songs and at first it was something great.
“We’ve been a band for three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that today we are still friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started working in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at photos, I remember Andy, how unbelievable he was, how I laughed at him.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The Las Robertas national band will be tasked with launching the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that that's why you chose them as pre-jumpers?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That is why we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it, and I think he's adding the first thing that comes to mind.
Who is influencing you as a bass player?
Lots of people.
The first to attack me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all night about bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I say grunge, I think of the bands I mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the other bands that were born at the same time, and if music like that is still valid today, it's something great because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney play better music today than ever before.
In the beginning, your music had a slightly gloomy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there are a few songs on the new album that are lighter, but there are also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound like a positive one.
For both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried, and they're songs that are deeply dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone from your family or a friend, these things will start to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make bleak music.
Peru:
Fujimori was hospitalized again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized at a public hospital on Tuesday, where he will be tested for muscle loss in his lower limbs, his doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated on four times and is now under medical control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N that Fujimori would undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases within three days, where they should find out why it hurts and why it loses strength in the lower extremities.
Aguinaga said he believed Fujimori could receive a pardon for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself did not want the pardon because he felt innocent.
He was operated on four times for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, and added to these problems other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a murderous squadron of troops operating illegally in the early years of his reign.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday. Its aim is to achieve the expansion of trade between the two nations and to touch on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n on Wednesday. This is the most important meeting of a large-scale visit full of meetings with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries,” the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy placed the South American country on the tax haven list at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that countries that would remain in the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community. This statement provoked a negative opinion from Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador to this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group made up of the world’s most powerful developing and developed countries. An information exchange agreement has been concluded with the Latin American country since January this year to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to concretize fiscal exchange agreements in order to get off the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) blacklist, which includes countries that have not implemented all the required international standards for tax cooperation.
From a trade point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has resulted in increased trade between the two countries.
Bearded plumber runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the villain Bowser, but he has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in all stores around the world, was created from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to use glasses.
“Mario is a character who has to tell us how stereoscopy without glasses should work,” Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a Nintendo press officer in Spain, said during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this medium" because until now successful shots such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of Time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesman said that in addition to being a 3D shot, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have overcome this level, you can start the "second round" at the levels of the game, which are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose real time between "aggressive D" or one that affects only the depth of action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D in order to overcome various challenges and "do not succumb to optical deceptions".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D is also anticipated with the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that the bearded man's plumber will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player finds novelties in movements, in the surroundings, in disguises and also among the enemies, Luigi will also appear "playful".
Colom Approves Portillo Release to U.S.
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had advanced steps on the issue of extradition of former President Alfonso Portillo, who is to be held accountable in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is the end of the process, which was aimed at Guatemala responding to the request of the northern country, which demands the extradition of Portillo in order to be able to prosecute him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch and that he was aware that the criminal court had already ordered the extradition.
He assured that during his term of office he had “not interfered” with court decisions and allowed any issues that came to his table.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's move marks a step of execution after all judicial and constitutional instances have been exhausted to lead a trial against the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found innocent in the case of embezzlement of 120 million at the Ministry of Defense during his presidency. This process was preceded by the release, but the Public Ministry appealed, bringing the case back into play.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people in a state of emergency
The organization was created to help children without education not to find themselves on the edge of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of Trinio’s existence is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organization has been helping them to overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this, it is necessary to add the long hundred jobs that have been created for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary also served to present the balance sheet as part of a ceremony that took place in the former production facilities of the Fabra i Coats factory and attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, joblessness, drug addiction, or social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unity of the work carried out by the Trinius.
Together with Generalitat President Arthur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor and current eco-socialist councillor Ricardo Goma attended the ceremony.
The big hall of Fabra and Coats was also visited by the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the General Manager of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinius was born in a very difficult time and that the present time also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day is "a good foundation".
The president cited the Trinius as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
“The crisis is nothing new for this organization and the work it does,” he said.
There was an eviction of a house in which giant parties were held.
Aliens appropriated 11 of 13 apartments in a building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon, not resisting
All indications are that the nightmare that the neighbors of number 51 in Balmes Street were experiencing is finally over.
Twelve people volunteered to leave a building they had illegally inhabited yesterday at noon, where they organized gigantic parties to wake up neighbors, leaving the building by court order without having to intervene with the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupants, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical and partially water equipment, painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments, huge parties were held, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the disco emphasizes that the occupiers of the building made unfair competition for her, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the disco costs 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to complaints from neighbors because of the noise, but the problems were not caused by the visitors of the disco, but by the residents of the occupied house and especially those who participated in the parties held here, whose frequency and intensity have increased in recent weeks, according to the angry residents of the neighborhood.
The owner of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months forgave her rent.
The city police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the city group of the People's Party of the PP in the city hall, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, last week demanded that "the building be immediately evicted to end the problems of civil coexistence that the neighbors are suffering, and the destruction of the area".
The president explained that only one floor had been taken up before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers had reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there had even been thefts.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be consistent when it comes to acts against civil responsibility that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police arrived at Building 35 on Mont-Ral Street after being summoned by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
The park or the mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of writing off a procedure that carries with it more than a polemic about the fees
The city’s 16-gate tender opens a debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this self-government printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The leaflet defined the mountain as a large park of metropolitan Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the collapse of the CMB in 1987, the park returned to the minds of many as the upper limit of Barcelona, because the Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not focus on the north-south axis, but up (mountain) - down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with the savages instead of the Yogi bear.
That was the position until September, when the city hall announced a mega-competition consisting of 16 auditions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
The gate, of course, records the idea of the park.
Either this, or someone's trying to put a gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, a park or a mountain?
During the competition, both from the point of view of purely organizational and based on reflection about the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It’s a topic as obliterated as when two members of this old caste, chosen to meet in the elevator, shake hands.
And it was this act that sparked one of the rare concurrences between what the three Barcelona architects and the preeminent university professors think.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure is justified.
According to Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after the issue of the Gulf side began, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so Ildefonso Cerdo's speech on green apples was not brought to the end.
"We must proceed from the principle that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gates to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we should not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as delimitation of zones where it is possible to act".
Modol, like Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience in the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" offering "some dangers".
The danger posed by the "uncertainty that the public place project presents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which in the Forum area had "his swan singing".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
“To define something is to take the next step,” that is, in principle, to go one step further.
"It is necessary to keep in mind the new urban and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM)) can cause a real disaster."
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the Collserola valley slope can be "considered as a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographic reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work done by the Patronat de Collserola, which "should not end up in a garbage dump", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his grémium, that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of pass that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but "does doubt" that it should be this technical profile that will lead the multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills," he adds) that need to be created: "Architects should only be tools."
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the title of this game is complex, because Collserola's global vision is missing in the tender documents: "There have been 16 tenders that address all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would look at the area and understand it as a whole."
This causes that at least he, has signed up for all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate may come across the concept and definition of the architect of the neighboring gate.
In his view, the city hall should guarantee that the zone immediately above Ronda de Dalt should provide a full-length zone of equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino Apologizes to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal to Be Released
After 72 days in prison, the legal representative, Cadino Red, granted a pardon to Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after his legal representative, Casino Red, granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal Court in the district, which was hearing a blackmail case in which Mayor Monterrey’s brother was indicted.
After the Casino Royale assassination, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s was supposed to ask him to pay an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally in a betting house.
After the public prosecution, the Public Prosecutor's Office launched a criminal prosecution of the brother of the Panist mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of the Public Ministry Agent No. 3 for property crimes, he was taken to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained at this location for the next 49 days after a second incarceration order was issued and a Public Ministry agent denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was taken to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a sum of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in a medium-sized prison because he was threatened with death.
During the trial, he was allowed to remain in urban cells in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been collected to prove Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s's guilt, for example, the payment of 1.5 million pesos to casino representatives in exchange for a promise that the operation would be allowed.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal representative, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, arrived at Judge José Luis Pecino and asked for mercy for the region’s mayor’s brother, which will allow him to return to freedom soon.
During the legal hearing, Ramiro Arias, a representative of the Public Ministry assigned to the court, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the associates had decided to grant a pardon, but the lawyer made it clear that the name would remain secret.
On the basis of the official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal. In the proceedings against him, it will not be possible to file any complaint. It is also not possible to apply for damages or punishment.
After a hearing with a legal representative around 3:50 p.m., the court ordered the immediate release of Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The court's secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza prison to inform Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case had been deferred to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come unveiled details of the plane crash that killed the Governor's secretary, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Department of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the investigation into the accident, in which Prime Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people died, show that the helicopter hit the ground with full force, without the pilot having a chance to try to make a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that prior to the take-off of the aircraft, the pilot stated that the climatic conditions allow flights.
"Parts appearing indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings entangled in tree branches 25 meters from where the unit lost its hull."
He also informed that the unit was intended for 19 people, therefore it met all the requirements for the transportation of personnel.
In addition, he said that on the basis of the investigation carried out in the area of the impact, no components were found on the ground.
"The search revealed that parts of the aircraft were not located elsewhere, so the aircraft hit the mainland as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for the transportation of people.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that the most important thing at the moment is to get the results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation can take several months or up to one year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the President’s General Staff helicopter was moving at cruise speed and the accident occurred on soft ascending terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal flight operation," he said.
At the press conference, the representative of SCT, Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, listed six basic points of the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, that is, the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at take-off, in accordance with which the aircraft is moving towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico there were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility up to the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last radar recording of the helicopter coincide, it is likely that there was no loss of control or disruption of the flight path before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft residues in a restricted area:
The information we currently have allows us to assume that the impact occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The pattern of dispersion of the aircraft's remains indicates that at the time of the impact on the mainland, the helicopter was integral.
There was no fire or explosion.
There was no evidence of an explosion or fire at the scene of the accident.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the mainland.
During the field work, the remains of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the inclination goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images where there was probably a breakup along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have come into contact with the ground in several locations.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in the area that is larger than the delimitation area, which reinforces the presumption that the impact occurred in a state when the helicopter was still intact.
Mexican Health Insurance Institute Starts Research on Gene That Causes Obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute of IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and young people. Research called "The genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Biochemistry Research Medical Unit at the National Health Center’s Specialized Hospital of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been set up.
This team relies on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The general public, with or without authorization, can also participate in the research. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where they will conduct tests to young people every council from 8 am.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since October 8, this activity has also been carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Center (East of the Mexican State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children have been obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to identify the components and importance of genetics when it comes to the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people and thus prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the goal is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of parents, for the application of specific nutrition questionnaires.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He specified that every Saturday, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are performed on all participants, blood pressure is measured, the level of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin is determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the development of childhood obesity).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the research reflects health care workers’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
"Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was a 77% increase in obesity in boys and 47% in girls, and a dramatic increase in overweight," said the expert from IMSS.
He stated that one of the reasons for the search for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country differs from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% Native American genetic equipment, 30% European and 5% African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the development of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, obesity genetics is commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fats.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they get an overall assessment of the condition of the children, thereby determining whether they show any known overweight or obesity.
He stated that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and pre-diabetes conditions.
So far, the information is confidential, and doctors give it to parents in writing and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent their children from getting sick.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting all day in front of the TV and using vehicles instead of walking for short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by a large caloric intake, that is, greater consumption of sweetened drinks, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins, and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
There will be no asphalt from UNAM
Rafael Herrera, a scientist at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers, creating a mixture that has better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature.
If the pavement was properly taken care of, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 pits after each period of rainfall in the Valle de México Metropolitan Area, said Rafael Herrera Najera, a scientist at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of asphalt pavements were adequate, it would be possible to remove them.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Bursts, which he delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership was developing modified asphalt with polymers, which should create a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, both at low and high temperatures.
Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believes that this kind of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country, to improve functionality and reduce the formation of pits.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a cluster of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules of high molecular weight called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight called maltens. Together they give asphalt a typical viscoelastic character.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt lies in the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to meteorological conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
A researcher from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Mexico City are covered with flexible tiles consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the top layers is an asphalt insert, consisting of small stones poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that makes up the insert is flooded with asphalt.
During the passage of cars or when creating pressure, it is so possible that the forces in the tiles are well distributed.
If it were modified asphalt, it would decompose even better, according to the chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert the last layer, called a mantle, is placed, consisting of fine stones, i.e. sand also poured in asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of vehicles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since as part of the pavement it will be exposed to a large load, the mantle must have a sufficient thickness and must pay attention to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also a very important factor to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great impact on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is moist, the water spreads inward and it is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of tiles and thus the formation of pits.
He explained that during the creation of pits, the film of the shell is first damaged and only then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, damage does not occur at one time, but it is a gradual process that should be stopped already at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of pits, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of pavement must correspond to the load of vehicles and it must be ensured that this load does not exceed. Only in this way can we prevent frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that when it comes to asphalt, we still have a lot of work to do and research is at the beginning. It is worth mentioning, for example, asphalt emulsions, which are already available on the market in other countries and allow you to easily repair pits without having to use high temperatures.
What was missing from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not get the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of First MajorMiss.
Valle del Cauca did not win the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, won a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the new first multi-mission Colombia.
On the basis of the results of yesterday's final in Cartagena, where she won the final (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19), Marin), Marin<0xC3><0xA1> (19, Marit), and Marit) (19, (19, Marn<0xC3><0xA1>), won the first prize), the first prize, and the first prize, the first prize, the first prize, the first prize, the first prized, the first prize, the first prize, the first prize, the second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, second prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first prize, first
A question that many ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of the big favorite, which in all previous rounds showed that she had to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of the Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who subsequently took the title of Miss Kolumbia.
One of the key factors that decided that the jury chose to name her only First Multi-Miss is the fact that she did not convince by her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was put by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez from the literary editorial office Leamos.
When asked by the candidate, she replied:
"I read a lot. I very much believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me most in my childhood was The Little Prince, a very deep book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the world literature that we should all know. And today I have a book with me from Irene Nemirovski, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was displeased, on the one hand, because of the term "cultivating" and, on the other hand, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned meant to her.
After the ceremony, Melina declared that she was calm and pleased with the result: “The world is wise, what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read it if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle destroyed the favorite position.
Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated and the one who won all the previous awards (Gastronomic challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and the Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other applicants, upset the Queen, who then burned down on the stage.
This was evident during the first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Even though she was shining on both of them, it was known that she lacked the strength and fervor shown by the representatives of Magdalena and Atl<0xC3><0xA1>ntico.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on Canal RCN’s “Home Alone” program, believes that Melinda’s winning the title of first multi-miss confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not end up leaving with the crown of the queen.
In addition, Valle has been rather unkind to the media in recent days, and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Competition.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country’s social needs.
"Beauty in itself is not enough in the Miss Colombia competition, it is necessary to see more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feeling. It is important that candidates are involved in such projects before entering the competition," she explained.
It has also been speculated that candidate Valle has lost points due to the shortcomings of her background and fibrosis, which was evident on the butt, but this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her to miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, who is preparing the Queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls here, "but problems with fibrosis on the butt, which in my opinion was not very noticeable, took away her points until the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that a native of Valle made a mistake when she underwent several surgeries.
"Surgical interventions are fine, but they failed in Valle.
The body was never her strong point, and here she took her toll."
Because of this award, which was first awarded by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimsuit parade, there was a cruel prediction that was fulfilled. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina gave, so that he did not have to grant her the highest crown in the end.
Whether this is true or not, it is certain that Melina has started her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be appointed by the National Competition itself.
However, it will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not reach the highest crown.
This was the work of a Cali resident who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A fingerprint specialist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, last year, a CTI fingerprint expert in Cali made history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc’s supreme leader: “Alfonse Cana” by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprint experts working at the CTI department, this week was the turn of Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked at Choc<0xC3><0xB3> Town Hall, where he often had to dig through the woods for more than five days to get to the place where there were corpses that had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital Valle, and after completing the relevant courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of rubbing the skin, i.e. the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliasar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night, he went to Cauca in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses and that he suspected that one of them was the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, they asked him to take a card with the fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n S<0xC3><0xA1>enz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the place where the corpse was located, he did not recognize him because of his physical appearance.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in the area, without glasses, much slimmer.
But prints don't lie.
Along with the galton magnifying glass, the ink, the transplanter, and the light, Eliasar began to compare the corpse's fingerprints with those of the card.
The eye did not disappoint him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a Puerto Tejada-born man was commissioned to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n whether he was indeed the Farc commander-in-chief.
Finding tracks
For the Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali dactyloscope, the recognition given by President Juan Manuel Santos to Elias Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at the press conference of the Operational Service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, without the possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying corpses, these people help to investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When they are caught, a lot of criminals present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and search the database.
The investigator said that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because at this place the thief was leaning to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case, we could get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who was involved in several thefts.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicion in a murder case.
Recently, they found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it was found that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the fingerprint on the bottle actually confirmed it.
Although it is impossible to 100% confirm that he was really a murderer, it is obvious that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that the objects are “wiped out with chemical or physical reactive substances.”
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used for their collection.
The prints are then sent to Asif, a criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many Colombians out there whose data are not listed anywhere,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as it appears on the CSI television program.
Just like everything that glitters is not gold, not everything you touch leaves traces.
However, if it can be used, an appropriate comparison must be made.
“Resentment” Protests in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to settle.
Most of them waited for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked representatives of New York on Tuesday as they tried to get back to Manhattan Square, from where they were taken in the morning, and then tried to take another New York park.
Hundreds of demonstrators slammed into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get due to a court order that allows the "outraged" to return to settle in place. The second part of the movement reacted to the clearing by occupying a park in the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
“If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through gatherings and peaceful demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the “Observe Wall Street” movement.
Bray clarified that the response of the “indignant” to the eviction of the camp, ordered by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order banning the forced eviction of the site and allowing the demonstrators to continue to reside there.
In addition, "indignant" took another park located at the intersection of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the parish grounds in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and detained some demonstrators. Bray did not know the exact number, but said that he saw that the handcuffs were also put on some journalists.
The organization said several hundred people had settled on the scene, and a delegation of religious leaders had come to express their support and to try to negotiate with the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed. A trial is expected to take place on Tuesday, during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the relocated demonstrators even carried out and distributed copies of the court order and even gave them to the officers guarding the square, triggering “some small clashes,” Bray said, condemning the fact that some police officers had beaten the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits authorities from expelling members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or using "laws that were published after the seizure began, or banning demonstrators from accessing the park with shops or other places they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city suspended the reopening of public space and warned demonstrators that local laws do not allow them to return tents and sleeping bags.
The city's top official personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and was joined by protesters "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he ordered the evacuation of the square because it became "a place where people did not go to protest, but to break the law and in some cases to hurt others", because "some shops received threatening letters" and "neighbors were worried about the quality of their lives".
"The early clean-up was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people," a spokesman for the movement said, accusing the mayor of "doing not respect freedom of expression."
Representatives of the Ocupa Wall Street movement also said that they plan to organize "big events" for Thursday, in cooperation with community and trade union organizations, to recall the two months after which the protests lasted, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be presenting the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Along with Michael Bublé and other notable Canadians, he will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a mercenary in "Baywatch", a bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
Private broadcaster CTV today announced that Anderson, along with sentimental songwriter Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 and will embody the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from online home pornographic footage, appears with his ex-husband, the "Motley Crüe" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in a manger.
As Josef, Peters appears on the stage, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a moderator on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peterse, Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, will appear in a special Christmas broadcast of CTV.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a “fox” at one of her concerts in New York.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP rises by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of declines that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has had to face since World War II.
The first estimates by the Tokyo government put the material loss at $300,000 million, a wound that heals well despite a difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% annually.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - predict the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partially explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
Businesses increased their investments by 1.1%, spending drops by 0.9% from January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to restore infrastructure, to use the scarcity to start completely from scratch.
Japan has awakened, in particular due to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma Yen
Toky was entrusted to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "rescue values" for investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the troubling US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results in July to the yen exchange rate in September.
While markets continue to besiege marginal EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is cautious.
“We need to pay attention to the risks that remain, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
Indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said most member states showed clear signs of an economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, showed that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It dropped four-tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The euro area has even fallen below the 100-point average, reaching 99.13 points.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With rapid and risky margin guarantees and the uncertainty that has reignited again, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to an exit from Europe’s great debt crisis.
The presumption that the “consent” of the new transitional Greek government is given by Brussels’ demands rather than by the genuine convictions of political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period he received in his appointment is likely to be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures would in no way support it and reiterated his demand for a new election to be scheduled for February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate that will culminate in a vote of confidence in the government tomorrow.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not clarify any doubts about his position: "We have pledged to help the interim government, but we have not committed to anything else."
The Conservative leader went a little far in his speech to the EU and the IMF. These organizations are supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs, but at the same time he declared that he will not support and sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already angered by the impact Papandreou has had on the referendum, stressed yesterday that its demands are insurmountable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and representatives of the main parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafay explained that Troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" of 8 billion. But there is no definitive date.
So the Greek spinner has a little more to weave from.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain has "achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which is "that it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is an instrument based on trust in man".
Yesterday, the Queen launched the 5th Global Microloan Summit in Valladolid with the belief that there is “no doubt” that this kind of operation is “completely necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the UN by 2015.
Spain will "continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the world and take this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", to which these loans are intended primarily.
"We have already achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The Microloans Summit is to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform to support the "basic objectives".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to get above the poverty line they currently live under.
The concept of microloans has spread to Spain and other countries of the world after “the pioneer of the idea, Muhammad Yunus, set out on this journey,” the Queen said, adding that it was “an act of justice and the necessary recognition.”
She described her father as an "admirable idealist who embarked on a journey to fight poverty." She met his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to get acquainted on the spot with his loan policy.
This experience was followed by others. The first global summit in Washington and another meeting, such as in the Ivory Coast in 1999, in Canada in 2006. "In all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development," explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, earned yesterday the title "head of the family", which she was awarded in Valladolid "the movement of the poor".
Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thus enabling the fight against poverty to continue.
"Ethical imperative"
Trinidad Jiménez, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said that it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with a period of balohobyt, because such cooperation is a "permanent duty".
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a "serious and honest policy to eradicate poverty", and now more than ever, governments in developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become a victim of austerity.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
State Secretary for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success that celebrates the concept of giving trust to the people to whom everyone else closes the door. Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva welcomed participants in the city, which "opens its doors to a spirit of solidarity that is contagious".
CDU proposes to elect European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was held in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without serious difficulties for Chancellor Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it became it only in the autumn, especially to satisfy party members who consider the government's policy today towards the Greeks and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians lax.
The proposal for the President of the European Commission submitted by the leadership was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates voted against and 10 abstained.
A few-minute ovation at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the chancellor, “the time for change has come.”
This could be reflected in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area Member States, but it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "with the aim of giving Europe one face".
This is, in any case, one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: Great Britain opposes it, and CDU leaders think Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same stance.
But the direction is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by a large majority the proposal to evaluate the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in a strengthening of the weight of Germany.
Driven by concerns about calming the climate inside her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to win a congress by talking about "small" European states or states in difficulty, willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe devotes one paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a job incapacity fraud?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against labor incapacity.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Social Welfare Office, where he will deliver a speech on a topic that has been recurring since 2007 on combating social fraud and redistributing solidarity.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased rigour, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of budget savings, the government intends to force private sector employees into a fourth day of incapacity for work before they start taking support in sickness.
Clearly, without the consent of the company, an employee who becomes ill would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to the newspaper Les Echos, could bring 280 million euros.
And also a measure that would be accompanied by further measures of symbolic scope: to give civil servants one day of unpaid incapacity for work (until now they have no incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of discussion, the right-wing majority is also launching a topic of fraud, this time focused on abuses associated with work incapacity.
"The controls will be much more extensive and moreover: if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview given to RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification seem somewhat disproportionate to the truth about incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and of political strife, which have borne fruit.
The French are not sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008, daily allowances, with their 11.3 billion euros, accounted for 5% of health expenditures.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity and work-related injuries and 54% concerned incapacity for work, i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6.2 billion.
That’s only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to a study by Alma Consulting, on average, the French had 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010, up from 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which hides certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the site dealing with job opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they did not choose any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time carried out by sickness insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to 3 months and 11% took longer.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are not more prone than elsewhere to incapacity for work.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) oscillated in France between 10% and 11.8% versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Cheating on incapacity for work is only a very small part of black work.
When it comes to fraud, these are only of a small scale.
Strengthening legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks aimed at incapacity for work for more than 45 days.
In 2008, CNAM found that 13.8% of the 285,000 checks carried out due to short-term incapacity were "unauthorized or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacities longer than 45 days, 11% of cases of "unadjusted or unauthorised" were counted to 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132 000.
So a total of 169,000 "unauthorized" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work on black.
According to UMP Member Dominique Tiana, the author of the June report on this issue, this figure would amount to 9 to 15 billion euros missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily compensation and therefore infinitely more than the fraud associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to restore its economy.
On Monday, 14 December, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos delivered these words before Parliament, adding that the one hundred days of unity given to his government would not suffice to fulfill this task.
"To put our economy back on its feet, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget rescue plan," the prime minister said as he delivered his first public speech at the start of the debate to vote on confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
Enforcement of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "principal task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake.
As a result, Mr Papademos assumed that the country's public deficit would be "about 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras voiced his support for the measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hand for any new measures," Samaras said at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would impede the economic recovery.
To Mr Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economy and Currency, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties supporting the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalised, says expert panel
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions in which they want to die, and make decisions in this sense.
This is one of the conclusions of an extensive report by the Royal Canadian Society, which involved six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government change criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if such a choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cited a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home, which most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in a hospital.
This average applies to the whole of Canada, while in the province of Québec this number is the highest with 86% of people dying in the hospital.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where such approaches are legalised or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that such criminalisation causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide to persons who are incompetent or dissenting.
On the contrary, Mr. Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed during a teleconference more than numerous cases of these abuses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Downie said.
Canadians are prone to euthanasia
According to a 2010 survey by the Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that we are sending out a message that the lives of old or disabled people are worth less.
When it comes to people who practice assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
In terms of maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose in their list of recommendations that criminal law should state that withdrawal from treatment for which there is a legally confirmed refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also requires that medical professionals be educated to respect the refusal of treatment at the end of life without fear of prosecution.
In the field of palliative care, the Commission urges governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, even in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silencing already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission demands that it be considered euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Mr Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, classified the report’s expert-signatories position as “extreme”, among other things, because it did not restrict the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stage.
“This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 years old could ask to be helped commit suicide,” said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the report’s résumés yesterday.
Deschamps also emphasizes that it seems as if the authors of the report put the autonomy of the person above all other values that shape the social fabric of society.
Because “in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions.”
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a" euthanasia manifesto ".
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, doubts in particular the data of the report regarding the absence of errors in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Urges President Assad to Resign
Damascus talks about "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressures on Syria were intensified by President Bashar al-Assad, who with Russia’s support resists them and talks about a “complot” against his country.
Two days after Syria’s suspension of membership in the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria’s neighbours, have taken a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first ruler of an Arab state yesterday to call on President Bashar al-Assad to kill about 40 civilians and members of the regime’s military forces in Syria.
“If Bashar had the interests of his country in mind, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life,” the King of Jordan, a country bordering Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, regretted that the Turkish mediation efforts under the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
“Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to neighboring Syria, against which Turkey is applying an increasingly hard line.
The United States rejoiced at the “strengthening of consensus against Assad and the dishonest actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are applying an increasingly harsh tone" to the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the regime’s forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa.
According to the NGO, two other civilians were killed “in gunfire and concentrated machine-gun fire in the city of Jobar” in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country was "on its way out of the crisis".
He also reacted vigorously to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus’ membership, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria “will not bow,” he added, reassuring that “combats spun against Syria will not succeed.”
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also favors the idea of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of a regime he says is behaving “paranoidly”.
A new special meeting of the League is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take an opinion on the plan for the resolution of the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which envisaged in particular the withdrawal of armies from the cities plagued by dissension and the release of the imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League’s decision “wrong” while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while avoiding any support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time and sacrifices for Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and start implementing a program that would include “victims” in order to regain the credibility lost in the last months of Berlusconi’s government.
The former European Commissioner discussed with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unionists and employers' representatives today.
He should put together a relatively slender cabinet composed of technocrats who do not belong to parliamentary parties.
“Monti spoke of an important programme with many victims,” said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the designed prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The consultation concludes with Mario Monti introducing a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitano.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked them for time.
"Democracy has precise deadlines" when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is "confident that the markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment as president was initially welcomed by the markets, but concerns resurfaced after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed prime minister should put together a team that primarily includes technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to accept "politics" in it.
He expressed confidence that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the new government will have confidence in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extreme urgency and with the aim of making Italy “a strong link” in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: "Even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy has not changed."
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013, and calls for new tough measures.
Confindustria head Emma Marcegagli, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, focused on the need to revitalise the economy "because a country that is not growing can't keep up with deficit parameters."
Mario Monti, a former European commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, a "professor" symbolizing, according to the authors of the editorials, "a call to prominence" and "another Italy", represents an "epochal change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The big unknown will be the lifetime of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place 200 billion euros worth of government bonds by April 2012.
Soviet scientist helps Iran's nuclear program
Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks said on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the UN agency to identify the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA voiced its “serious concern” about the “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS, which draws extensively from IAEA documents, V. Danilenko (born 1934) was to work for three decades since the 1960s at the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the center to establish a company in Kiev producing "nano-diamonds".
His company's economic difficulties were intended to lead him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he was to collaborate on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear evidence that the development of the detonation system carried out by Iran" was based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one member state reported to the agency - worked during a significant part of his working career on this technology as part of the military nuclear program of the country where he comes from."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Offences Increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and offences targeting Muslims increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or rose little.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase compared to the 13% increase for violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease for offenses against Jews, and an overall 14% increase for anti-religious criminal acts and offenses.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose very easily to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these criminal acts and delinquencies rise again,” Human Rights First, a human rights organization, said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” adds Paul Legendre, one of the organization’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to deal with these abuses,” he adds, and estimates that this could be done by improving police reports of “hateful criminal acts.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the Civil Rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. to punish violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin, and now sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and more like Facebook
Twitter, a microblogging service provider, introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activities of its successors, which somewhat resembles its Facebook services.
The new "activity" and "name" offers allow you to know better and directly the activities of other people who follow you or whose replies ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to track posts, whether they sign in to new accounts, whether they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August on a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, Carolyn Penner, a spokesperson for Twitter, told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for redistribution of someone else's contribution, followfriday pour recommender de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large public avec avec grande avec
On the network, users immediately in their "tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it takes up a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track some elements of my Twitter," <0x40>dannykronstrom posted.
Austria-Hungary
Inscription of the golden rule of balanced budget in the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to enshrine a "golden rule" of budgetary policy in the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's rating agencies (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a ministerial meeting in a situation where Austria’s public debt is 74.6% high above the Maastricht Treaty’s maximum threshold of 60%, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency had been reduced by only one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have had to pay three billion euros more each year in interest,” said Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria follows up on the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be enshrined in a constitution or a law of the same value.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the federal state’s public structural deficit will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while the federal states, as well as the municipalities, will have to report a balanced budget.
The aim is to get public debt under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty within the 2020/21 horizon.
Strong only
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to re-engage in foreign exchange markets if they were to continue to strengthen.
"We will intervene, as we did the last time, if we find too much volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Y. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, it only re-emerged to the historic values that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which had only recently broken the record against the dollar since 1945.
But only since then has it regularly risen in support of the purchases of investors who consider it a “safe haven” in uncertain times of global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar fell again below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar close to the levels that triggered the latest intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
This flare-up of the Japanese currency harms island exports as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of revenues received by Japanese companies from abroad when they convert them into domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the disasters caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this increase in the yen will not kill a fragile recovery in the egg.
The world’s third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter) for the first time in one year, thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-laden households.
But the prime minister concluded that the high value of the yen did not reflect Japan’s “national economy.”
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which began a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s multi-governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, pointed out that the BoJ had previously taken “appropriate measures” suggesting that no additional monetary weakening could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Institute increased by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) its purchases of government treasury vouchers and raised to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates to purchases of various securities in order to flood liquidity.
The euro area:
The prices are rising, the stock markets are failing.
The risk of a debt crisis is still undermining European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to grow.
European exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are falling into negative expectations on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 index loses 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions over borrowing revenues from eurozone countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to generate only a fraction of recent profits.”
“Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, IG Markets broker, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, which it suffered due to market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-starting of uncertainties about the future of the euro area is damaging the currency itself, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
At 10 a.m., the European currency is valued at $1.3570, with a retreat of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency withdrew after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party adopted a proposal at its congress on Monday for countries in trouble to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions affecting interest rates in southern European countries, but also in France, continue to reinforce market participants' concerns.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti strongly demanded time in the markets to be able to remedy the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of her debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the October 27 summit of the eurozone will be his government's "principal task".
Spain is once again in the deliberate direction of the markets as the country holds elections to the House of Representatives on Sunday.
The spread between Germany and Spain’s 10-year bonds reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of the growth figures of the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than the expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies INSEE revised down the figures for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
And in fact, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
For its part, Germany recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first euro area-wide estimates are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balance sheets or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural for an election meeting to be an opportunity to think about such deposits and the place that the energy from the core occupies.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
There are 7 billion human beings on the planet so far, but demographic developments will cause electricity demand to double by 2050 if we do not want to rid a significant part of the world’s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, there will be a shortage of fossil resources to continue generating electricity, while not forgetting the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a theme that is currently disappearing from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany is left alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
But this is not the case for Belgium, which subordinates its decision to find another source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it right to build only last-generation power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by restoring the construction of a single power plant interrupted after the accident of the Three Mile Island power plant.
If the German model based on renewable energy is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts this.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power, which consumes 30% of its electricity, is also one of the biggest consumers of coal and gas due to wind irregularities, which is why CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay an electricity invoice 40% higher than the French households pay.
While in a globalised economy energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industry on national territory, French businesses enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would cause a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, just as they fundamentally do not oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that the energy policy of our country has allowed to build a sector with 125,000 direct jobs and with 410,000 follow-up jobs.
The highly exportable sector brings to international markets a large number of small and medium-sized specialised enterprises creating jobs that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a considerable number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year, which the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled to fail?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magical source for energy production, and that there is no devilish one.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Office for Nuclear Safety, which conducts uncompromising and transparent supervision of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one in Three Mile Island occurred in normal operation and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama was caused by the reactor concept and unforgivable human errors.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the crash was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident in the same way as it did the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the French and German nuclear safety authorities, operators and designers is that an EPR reactor is a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all interested parties who wish to build a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to the competitors of the AREVA Group and EDF and pave the way for them to take a leading position in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so decisive for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - the congestion of police, courts and administrations subjected to a policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "human rights country" of which France boasts.
Recently, this was an administrative harassment aimed at foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the Libération newspaper of May 23) declared that France "does not need foreign talents, bricklayers and waitresses".
But so far, it has rarely been discussed from the point of view of the economy.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
On the right, Jacques Chirac stated in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country where 2 million migrant workers are" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, fears of an invasion by hordes of Polish plumbers into French territory were shared to the right and to the left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are committed to providing to immigrants.
In his programme, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to the banality of stating that joint developments will enable us to solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work Synthesizing the Latest Knowledge on Immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.): among specialists there is a broad consensus on the positive impact of migratory movements.
Restrictions on immigration are crippling growth and damaging jobs.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less skilled, and create pressure to cut their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more a complement than substitutes for French workers by doing jobs in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Few skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as the surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, these additions between French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the wages and employment of French workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration movements would trigger a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
It does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, on average, at 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Labour Organization estimates that in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets in his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy expressed a wish at the beginning of his mandate to come up with the missing percentage of growth "with prized teeth".
These teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, and colonels in Greece.
Some people may have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
However, it is already known from Napoleon that it was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, though a necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and can become an “instrument of oppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization of separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crises of politics and democracy.
Admitting the mistake of a Greek referendum of the type yes-no will have the value of a double revelation in this regard: a revelation of the necessity of a great return of political power, but also a revelation of a disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today and that many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can get nothing if we demand a series of national referendums organised as necessary and disorganized.
Bianca exposed to the European absolutist monarch or jumping with his feet tied into the void of nationalist depths: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want guillotine knives, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - and we would no longer know where to stop the list - because the crisis is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe, bowing to the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, suffering from its incompetence and its lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is being humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it every one of its peoples.
The management of the European project of democratic sovereignty must be restored urgently.
For only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of the government of the markets and prepare the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will presuppose decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise it would lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today is strongly demanding a European economic government.
Yes, sir.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such by citizens, would be a new folly and a new dead end.
We need to take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to "be" republicans.
The interest revolution could not have been enough.
This lesson continues.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be done by building a Europe of more politically democratic and genuine European democratic sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans in order to build Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Chip Card Fair will open in Villepinte, near Paris, on Tuesday.
According to the Eurosmart office, 2011 should end with an increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank cards, phones with a SIM card) by 11% on more than 6 billion units.
The most wearable is the segment of contactless technology, which allows you to pay in public transport or handle purchases by simply approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million smart cards will be sold worldwide, compared to 320 million sold a year earlier.
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (expected to reach 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Having long been in the grip of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big retail chains work for two.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to include a higher gear, it is necessary for banks to equip their clients with them from now on.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the means of payment of the future: a mobile phone.
Today, only a small number of devices are equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology to perform transactions.
"They're late."
"But their real momentum should be next year."
“For 2012, we estimate worldwide sales of 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Crédit agricole announced the launch of a test in the city of Caen, which will run from December to June next year.
About 200 iPhone clients and co-workers will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale announced yesterday that it was preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay with a mobile phone contactlessly.
The terrorist front extends from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the alliance between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are ties between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Boko Haram sect of Niger are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has “been assured of this from now on.”
“The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them,” he said.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two French men in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their abductors in an operation carried out by special French units.
In the rubble after the raid, French and Nigerian investigators were to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The Terrorist Axis
Analysis of the calls made leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria that is the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
“It’s progress, but there’s no doubt we need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” Nigerian investigator Kunle Amuwo said in a statement.
In recent months, this “support” has become more and more apparent in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or its operational practices, which now involve human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as those used by AQMI.
The international community, led by Washington, has since put pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems that Boko Haram has raised.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
Fast success
Boko Haram was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in Haoussa means"Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of the Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its supporters launch a fight against the 'central government'.
These people first focus on churches, bars, and offices.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks against police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army surrounds the city, resulting in 800 deaths.
The founder of the sect, Mohammed Yusuf, was captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its headquarters in the north.
On Christmas Day 2010, the city of Jos was assassinated, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram will attack the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
In August, the United Nations will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on worries all security specialists.
Now that al-Qaida of the Islamic Maghreb has surrounded Mali and the Al-Shabaab Games and Somalis are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new danger to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, during an interview with President Goodluck Jonathan Alain Juppé, he said that France is on standby and ready to "give all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran, or helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are outpacing simplification and ignorance.
Can America, weakened by the crisis, govern the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When you listen to the presidential candidates, the voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating noisy statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
Often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel merge with each other.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the Republican Grand Old Party nomination race, has threatened to call the Chinese to the World Trade Organization and accuse them of “manipulating their currency,” a topic that has been raised in America by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Worse still, if this must involve the launching of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated foreign policy vision, is almost stuck in a position that “smooths” emotions.
He demanded a hard but constructive dialogue with Beijing (the current position of President Obama).
But Huntsman, who ranks last in the election estimates, remains unheeded.
The Image of President Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfare language.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb."
He also pledged to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his duties to Israel.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, demonstrates embarrassing ignorance of documents.
He recently called for a sharp stance against China’s military threat because Beijing is “trying to develop nuclear capabilities” – apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned a nuclear weapon since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the US military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and another candidate, Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy, in 2008.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They emphasize the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the boys from Iraq, his excuses regarding Libya, and thus attribute to him the label of a weak man.
But the attack is not easy.
The population is judging President Obama’s national security policy, which removed Ben Laden, rather positively.
Since Iraq, he has no confidence in military interventions that lead to embarrassment.
And with the argument that America needs to be reconstructed economically in order to resuscitate its leadership, Obama is on the right track.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry of Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline directly connecting Eastern Europe to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to work.
It has to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to properly celebrate this event.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part in the inauguration of Nord Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly under the sea last Tuesday.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned the control valve of Russian gas into the Western European network.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow to Western Europe each year through the first pipeline with a length of 1,224 km connecting the region of St. Petersburg with the federal state of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline, which has to be completed at the end of 2012, will enable a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas to be supplied, which is equal to the total French consumption.
And it is already recalled the possibility of building a third pipeline pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge building is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic states strongly opposed the project.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being driven across the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some power: the possibility of putting pressure on Russia by threatening to shut down its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream to the "new German-Soviet Pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that it is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, through its support for this Russian project, has gained greater confidence in its purchases.
But this is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, because the project has created gaps between Europeans from the east and the west.
Russia barely managed five years ago to enforce its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are coming to an end.
“This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon confirmed at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating the point at which major gas contracts are a matter of both political and economic importance.
All this explains the broad smiles of Gazprom’s leaders present in large numbers at Lubmin, the gas supply point.
The construction of this pipeline is also an important technical act.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with a concrete sheath to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It rests at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, minefields from the Second World War had to be avoided.
“For security reasons, nearly a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to increase measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, which in its entire length is not interrupted either by valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was supposed to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were only reluctant to see Russian state-owned companies settle permanently off their coast.
“In the event of a malfunction, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute,” explains Jens Müller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely to the builders, because the welds were designed so that the leakage occurred once every 100,000 years.
Control of the condition of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by an underwater robot pulled by a ship, while the inside of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is introduced into the inside of the pipe and is pressed with gas.
At the finish line, it will provide accurate information on any deformation of metal parts during the entire three days of the journey at 3 m/s.
The remote gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is simply secured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish line.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
The leading position remains Gazprom, which holds a share of 51%.
It was joined by the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies set up a joint venture called Nord Stream in charge of the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years with a renewable contract all of its gas transportation capacity.
“Gazprom will profit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported,” said Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of work is expected to reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs have risen to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the exit gate of the gas.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has received one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine - brand notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded 50 years ago, wants to bring back the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, the hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable with its black rectangular plates and its white leaves as if they have aged over time.
After all, the notebook Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, will then decide to launch a new design but distributed notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, takes up the introduction of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, to adjust the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought back to popularity an old and forgotten object that was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand’s leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is far from secret production from the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to assemble an artificial portrait of the buyer, since the notebook will attract the businessman as well as the student or professionals.
The image of Moleskine’s notebook is that its owners are cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-minded.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost one hundred employees, and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and, through the FNAC chain of stores, to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he was able to assert his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, through the tumultuous development of emails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently the brand opened the exhibition "Zach<0xC3><0xA1>zka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival, she also released new notebooks reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifies its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand extends to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which is writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the number of unemployed disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th Week for the Employment of the Disabled.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% compared to 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
“No,” says <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Disabled Employment Week.
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher."
"However, there's still a lot to do."
It should be said that there are numerous obstacles for unemployed persons with disabilities before they go to work.
These are the elderly: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate, and of the 2.3 million university students, only 10,000 are handicapped.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and represent the “core of the problem,” according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses accept disabled workers.
So much for objective brakes.
There are unspoken ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité Association found that the managers surveyed had a "weak level of knowledge about disabled people" with an "exaggerated idea of people in a wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from reaching the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 Act.
The last known figures, dating back to 2008, show a status equal to 2.6%.
“We’re now moving around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization charged with charging businesses that don’t comply with the law.
Proof is the number of 'penalised' enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which fell from 59,000 to 46,000 enterprises between 2007 and 2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, put a lot of pressure on businesses,” explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates true awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling:"What luck"
Before they challenged the French nationals (Bleus) on Tuesday evening (20h45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match would bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke to his player only words of praise.
“I am very happy with Eden and his progress, even with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," says the French player Lille.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and national team matches, "it's one and the same, it justifies itself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my mark."
Gambling, investigated against Romania on Thursday evening for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "glow up".
The term “joy” cannot be overlooked.
Play against Bleus, whom he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their victorious campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he said.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
All the more so, because opposite"there are Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crucified ourselves immediately."
"The power to play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens kindly reminded me of "pride."
"Pride" to fight"match - holiday".
"Pride" also states in the quality of "neighbors" that France, a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna, "again became a very high-level team".
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will be missing at the next European Championships, a technical footballer would like to see himself on a plane with the French in 2014 in the direction... Brazil.
“Our little Belgians will become big,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll realize it for the next game." Including that against France.
Portugal is very confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento starts a barrage against Bosnia Bosnia (22h00) this Wednesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
The Portuguese national football team, which has been at the helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left to play and one opponent - Bosnia.
With the knowledge of Friday's result (0-0) in the hell of Bosnia's Zenica, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had more than an hour of lead, but it was not able to give such a rare goal that would relieve him.
"It's a good result, but it still carries a risk because we didn't score a goal outside."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will advance in front of an audience that should create a boiling pot there, even though the match definitely seems to be “very balanced,” says the optimist, but cleverly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced match, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's indecisive match in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score a goal and win.
An indecisive match can be enough for Bosnians, who also need to score a goal.
“It’s a good result, but it still carries a risk because we didn’t score a goal outside,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and that has players with great individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in putting maximum pressure on the Bosnian team from the start, so that "they will not be given time to think."
Good idea, provided it turns out to be realistic this time.
