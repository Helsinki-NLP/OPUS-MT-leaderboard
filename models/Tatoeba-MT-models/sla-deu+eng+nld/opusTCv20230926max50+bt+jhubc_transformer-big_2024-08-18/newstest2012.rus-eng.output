Parliament does not support the amendment that gives Tymoshenko freedom
Today, the Parliament of Ukraine, in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to cancel the article according to which the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko, was convicted.
The amendment, which would have led to the release of the former prime minister in prison, was rejected during the second reading of the bill on commuting sentences for economic offences.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia, which was deemed unprofitable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider Tymoshenko’s appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the verdict is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process is also suspected of bias.
The proposal to repeal Article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, according to which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 Members of Parliament.
It would require 226 votes to ratify.
The Victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya already has losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried somewhere in the desert. Without him the war is over.
It is time to identify the winners.
Islamists usually win in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the customary law of Sharia, of which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is cutting off a hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society made up of rival clans will be united by the Qur’an.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and that we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is not the only one of its kind, nor the best, and most likely would not be suitable, for example, for the population of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic militants accepted help from unbelievers.
Their only excuse is that, in their opinion, NATO’s raids were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after each strike.
And if you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of profit.
In view of the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not have to worry about the expulsion of the “crusaders”.
Although without occupation, will oil companies get Libya’s black gold for almost nothing?
And then the West will finally be able to boast of selfless protection of civil rights.
Unless the Shari'ah's followers put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight of investors.
A statistical storm swept over Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries released data on GDP in the third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was stagnant, with Germany and France showing growth.
Today, the debt market is breaking records.
Investors are already looking not only towards Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany was doing better than expected (an increase of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%). France reported a slight decrease, by 0.1% (the initial information assumed stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, compared to the previous quarter, GDP was in a state of stagnation. According to the Czech Statistical Office, this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economy of both the Eurozone and the European Union showed growth of 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' forecasts.
The Greek economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield of its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The profitability of both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Despite the fact that the situation in the region is deteriorating, the yield of Czech 1-year bonds remains about 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech national team was selected in the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and celebrate an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team successfully coped with the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Yiracek, they won 1-0.
In the second half, the Czech team was lucky to retain a significant advantage after the home rematch, and she will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first half and good luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly due to the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Jiracek; won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrates the European Championship.
The excellent defense of the Czech team allowed the team of Montenegro to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> and Vu<0xC4><0x8D>ini<0xC4><0x87> became the most unsuccessful couple of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The magnificent Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech is one of the reasons that the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year. And Czech football will earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute the game was very intense.
Both teams had difficulty with the combinations; the game was played in the center of the field most of the time.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the host team in the first half. Long-range strikes over the defensive line were carefully intercepted by Czech defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
Several hundred university students have created a human shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
In doing so, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
At noon on Tuesday, the prayers of students before entering the building were followed by a prayer for the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a human shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
In this way, they have demonstrated a willingness to defend their country’s nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) pointed out that everything indicates that Iran has not abandoned its attempt to acquire nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
At noon on Tuesday, prayers of students before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant were followed by a prayer about the death of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at maximum paralysis of the Iranian nuclear program, the targets will be, according to the Israeli press, installations both in Isfahan and in Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Food for obese children: No breakfast and sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 weigh more than normal; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to the latest study, children suffering from obesity usually come from families leading an unhealthy lifestyle.
We again see the importance of the environment and the behavioral patterns that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage appears on the tables of children suffering from obesity, almost twice as often as in families with children of normal weight.
More than 19% of obese children ate french fries for dinner on the eve of a survey related to an educational event called Obesity is no accident.
Moreover, families of children suffering from obesity do not play sports. This, however, applies to most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15% of children said that their parents find time to play sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of the last academic year and involved nearly 900 primary school students across Bohemia.
Obesity is not an accident held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Vesobn<0xC3><0xA1> zdravn<0xC3><0xAD> poji<0xC5><0xA1>t'ovna and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 schoolchildren from 4 to 8 grades have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and sufficient exercise are the main determinants that cause a rapidly growing number of children who suffer from either overweight or obesity.
“For example, only half of the respondents said they ate five times a day, according to the breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner scheme, and this is one of the prerequisites for proper nutrition,” the study concluded.
No lunch and no sausage in the evening.
Experts warn that even such relative details as the constant time of family breakfast are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast together.
Most families eat breakfast separately.
The worst discovery is that in one in ten families, people don’t eat breakfast at all.
And yet, breakfast is the basis of the correct daily diet.
The study found that fried food is more often consumed in families with children suffering from obesity.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet refreshments every day (70%).
Although more than 40% of children regularly exercise, this figure is more than halved – up to 15% – when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the products offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"Food preferences in Czech children aged 12-15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Their favorite food includes a large number of flour, meat and sweet dishes.
“A particular concern is the high popularity of sugary soft drinks,” the study concluded.
As the main dinner, the pasta defeated the bird with a slight advantage.
However, the children showed little interest in legumes, fish and vegetable dishes.
Striving for a healthy lifestyle
The study also found that children were willing to change their eating habits, provided they were provided with relevant information.
"Many participants in the control group of the study demonstrated a significant shift in preferences towards healthy eating when they filled out a questionnaire after the end of the lecture Obesity is not an accident," the project concluded.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet soft drinks - more children began to prefer them just water.
In addition, as the main dish, children more often noted birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet dishes and pastries.
A stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article about training for stylists, I lamented the amount of information at the introductory classes.
I had no idea what would happen next.
Lectures by three experts in the field; tips on choosing clothes for non-standard figures; and a workshop on how it all works in real life.
Further - more.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
The training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is really full of information.
This time with Alenka, the director, (there is not a single man in the course) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boyish figure without proper shapes, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to emphasize the figure of women like Jennifer Lopez, i.e., owners of a lush chest and thighs and a narrow waist, and not to dress them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the volume of the waist and hips is so large that it is impossible to pick up a skirt or pants, it is worth having at least one thing sewn to order.
You will clearly not regret the invested funds, as perfectly sitting clothes are invaluable.
In a skirt, sewn to order, you will feel much better than in the one that constantly moves, rolls, strips the waist, etc.
Owners of boyish figures, on the other hand, can wear clothes with ruffles, applique, embroidery or folds.
Given the abundance of such information and types of figures, I am glad that I have a whole week to realize all this.
And yet, I'm afraid, that's too much, given the homework we've been given.
Each participant of the course had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: for the day and for the evening.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know about Victoria's Secret's advertising campaigns.
I am happy for myself, because it is much easier to dress her than, say, Britney Spears, Christine Aguilera, who has recently recovered by a ton (please bear in mind that I am exaggerating), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut clothes out of magazines or find them online, print and process them using graphical programs.
The Moodboard - the so-called result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep the graphic component of the style in mind.
Stylist not only dresses real people, but creates food pages in magazines (based on special instructions, for example, fashion bags, coats, etc.).
This is what stylist and designer Mario Kamenik told us.
But it was only on Sunday.
The stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, full of information about the types of figures, was revived by three guests - specialists in this field.
Stylist, Honza Submissive; fashion designer, Jakub Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Yakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn in the usual way, over jeans and a T-shirt like a coat; but it can also be worn on a bare body, without zippers, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
“Play with him,” he said.
However, I most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you need to know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,” Jacob told us.
Here I finally understood why we’re going to go through all the definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, while in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention fashion shows.
From Ben, the photographer, I learned that the stylist should have more outfit options than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review of ten pages (equivalent to ten outfits) I must be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that the item of clothing in the picture often looks and works in combination with others is not at all like in reality.
We have to keep this in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style is half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn’t have striking vocals, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
The attitude to the services of stylists in the Czech Republic is still quite cool.
Even famous people often consider it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look - a second time).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to call us a different (less) size than the one they actually wear.
Then we turn to Google and find out if the tabloids wrote anything about some celebrity getting fat/lost, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it was not enough for a stylist to understand fashion and be able to pick up an outfit.
Our job is basically to communicate with the people we dress; that’s why it’s important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to evaluate people, not to condone them and stick to their opinion.
“If a manager asks you to look through her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can’t throw away her entire wardrobe by telling her that her clothes are terrible.”
“Find at least a few things you can praise and advise what you can wear with them,” says Mario.
He also showed us what specifically should fit a work bag.
This is a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to the obvious things such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, such as bags or hats), special clips to fasten the fabric on the back in case the clothes are too large (bulls and similar items are prohibited because they spoil the clothes) or a set for a seam.
In order to distract from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned how to properly make linings on the soles of shoes.
Even when filming in a studio where the floor is smooth, the soles can get damaged — not to mention outdoors.
And here we are, sticking.
You should not touch the shoes with scissors so as not to spoil them.
It requires real skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
These skills did not appeal to me.
This is only part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend courses.
I’m starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn’t that easy, no matter what you say.
V Need for Speed: Escape takes place in America.
Revision
What was supposed to be a carefree walk turned into a routine morning trip to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were satisfied to a certain extent, but this is not important, since no one clearly wanted to do extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subheading "Escape" was associated with great hopes.
It was expected to move the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game will take a worthy place in the genre of racing games.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the protagonist gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, in the end, a lot is different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade race, but the overall impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary mistakes that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in fact, this is not a mistake, but a manifestation of an inexplicable laziness of developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You become part of a story whose protagonist, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You get in a car on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your task is to get to New York first.
This idea has some interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race takes place on its own route, individual stages take place in a diverse and interesting environment.
There is no sense in the game that the same thing happens all the time.
Despite the fact that the graphics are at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some tracks are nice to look at.
However, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, through the autumn suburbs or high in the snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race from time to time revives an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains you need to be careful not to get under the avalanche.
The individual races are well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that’s enough.
For a while you try to overtake several opponents (essentially a regular race); then you try to improve the time (standard race with a stopwatch); or you compete against one opponent.
Among other things, you occasionally run into the police, which further complicates your task.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It’s just an interactive animation where most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's nothing complicated.
Although it is surprising that these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
In fact, it turns out that it’s good for the game because it doesn’t bore you; given all of the above, it’s one of the things that makes the game more entertaining.
The racing model follows in the footsteps of previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a disadvantage.
If you’re looking for an imitation of real life, you’ll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
It's all very well so far.
However, after a while, the problems begin.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
From such a game you do not expect complex transformations and collisions, but if you have no idea before the collision with the object, how your car will behave, something is wrong.
Usually, by overtaking or passing cars in a dense flow, you sometimes slightly touch another car. And yet sometimes in a practically similar situation, your car begins to swirl furiously.
Or it's broken.
It’s not so important thanks to the reboot system, but it’s enough to ruin the fun.
Restarts are arranged so that if you crash or leave the track far away, the game takes you back to the point where it was interrupted.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you will have to start the race from the beginning.
This is useful if something is not working out, but you can’t fully rely on it.
Sometimes restarts are not enough, and you have to memorize a separate section of the race.
An important drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just don’t fit in.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain place in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars moving in the opposite direction, whereas when you get there, the cars are already positioned so that you need to either go around them or drop the speed.
It doesn’t matter when you’re near them; everything is arranged so that the situation always happens right in front of your nose.
Competitors have other advantages.
During the game you discover several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent overtakes you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge where you drive in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent must stand before you no matter what.
The fact is that when he drives in front of you, he worsens your vision, which leads to one or more accidents in that area.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and filled with adrenaline, but it is so obvious that it quickly begins to cause irritation.
It’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the game is entertaining and sometimes so full of events that you don’t have time to pay attention to what’s going on around you.
It doesn’t matter what doesn’t make you miss – a concept with fifty unique tracks, a sequence of races or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of gas stations along the way, as they are where your car can change, despite the fact that in most cases the one you already have is quite enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for cities; powerful American cars are suitable for straight sections of the highway; and exotic super-sportsmen for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain trails.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; these are races on individual sites that you will learn during the game.
Here you win for your personal business both medals and points common to the challenges and story modes.
Many opportunities are available to get a higher level of driving: ranging from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is associated with the online Autolog feature, which, among other things, compares the results you have achieved with the results of other players, and provides communication with the public.
Here’s another flaw that’s hard to understand; it’s an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car get into a subway tunnel (let’s assume so), where you race the tracks in the dark (let’s assume so).
Your speedometer shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let’s assume so) when a subway train suddenly hits you from behind, turning your car into a pile of scrap metal.
For several days, our editors have been discussing whether, when creating the game, no one really thought for a second, or whether its creators really consider us such fools.
The technical component of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression of the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even stunning.
Although it is a pity that at some critical moments the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, decreases.
This is especially true of incidents with a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for the amateur.
In order to please the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack "included compositions from different styles"; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
The overall impression of Need for Speed: Escape is quite messy.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Of course, this is a good entertainment, but be prepared for the fact that the flaws will blind you as an airport spotlight.

Ambassador to the EU Viceneva:
The Czechs have a reputation as ill-wishers and skeptics of the euro.
“The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable dissension between the various organizations.”
“I didn’t expect there to be such a brutal war.”
“It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles,” EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
She proved how much she adheres to her motto "Clear and open about Europe" in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them so simple and understandable that many lecturers from the Faculty of Law of KU would be envious.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
“At first, critics said he was an ordinary gray office mouse that couldn’t perform any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he did with his role.”
He is a person who can listen to the 27 participating countries at the same time, communicate with them well and who has a clear idea of which direction the EU should develop.
She explained her new position as a representative for international relations and security as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy towards countries such as China or India.
No one is going to ban our cheeses.
Vicenova further focused on the programme, which is key for the EU in the past, present and the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency successful last year.
The Czechs were dealing with the impending financial crisis; they overcame this crisis and organized an Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
Currently, the Czech Republic’s representatives in the EU are very busy.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the ongoing fermentation.
In addition, it is necessary to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult, given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be scarce and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which will receive less; all these issues are in the forthcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans that she brought to Brussels: “About Europe, Intelligible Language”.
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curves or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheeses?
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multi-speed Europe – Our Future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered Eurosceptics; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive aspects of things.
She wants more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that several factors are to blame: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and a Slovak joins us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, why is the assembly again the Visegrad Group?' and he is not happy about it at all.'
In the future, the Viceneva Union expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, she considers the idea of a two-speed, if not multi-speed Europe more realistic.
“We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone.”
“We have a Schengen area and we already have an institution of enhanced cooperation.”
“For the first time, it has been said that countries that want must unite, while those that don’t want can stay away.”
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe," Vicenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in advancing the rule that all EU-wide issues should be discussed by all member states, not just eurozone members.
Brand history:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find the word that best expresses the IMB strategy, the closest ones are likely to be “long-lasting.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The longevity of the company was laid by its first boss, the dreamer Thomas J. Watson Sr..
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the life of the future giant unfolded (as well as the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began to publish in 1935).
Moreover, it was the basis of the corporate culture that Watson carefully built.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving towards the future.
IBM survived and thrived for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, this has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred years,” says Samuel J. Palmizano, the current CEO of the company, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Complicated system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care in the same way as Father in the Czech Republic – IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
The same is true for IBM’s long-term relationship with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company found brilliant application to talented people. It was one of the first global companies to eliminate all discrimination, which gave it an excellent choice.
It agrees with an anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan under which a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmizano next year.
She worked for IBM for thirty years; she is currently Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
Over the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorming, during which many future innovations arise.
Not surprisingly, there are a lot of ideas - about half a million people work in the company.
Organization with a good reputation
A strong position of the company in the business is provided by a strong internal and external image.
“From the outset, in terms of concept, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company,” said Harvard Business School professor and author of the book on IBM Rosabet Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, it’s a company that helps solve business problems using technology,” adds Joge Coloni from consulting firm Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between entering the market and creating it.
Within a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company – developing hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services – from servers to nanotechnologies.
It holds the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, with five of its employees receiving the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, an ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a barcode, and a floppy disk.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM this year became the second largest technology company (first place at Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking Forward
Not all of its products were to the taste of buyers and fit into the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online service Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is determined by moving forward, you can’t be emotionally attached to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That’s why IBM easily lays foundations on multiple platforms – if they don’t work, it gives them up.
This is different, for example, from its competitor Microsoft, which is based and experiencing crashes on Windows, its operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s main revenues come from services, with about one-fifth in each case coming from computer programs and hardware.
Whereas in 1990, with a capital of half, it was the strongest equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-profit assets worth $15 billion. At the same time, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who increased the number of investments during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM has not harmed the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the stock price of IBM has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net earnings have grown steadily.
IBM’s corporate motto is to change everything except your own values.
Therefore, we can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this flexible giant will cope with the situation.
IBM History: From Cheese Knife to Space Flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago. Its original name "Computing, Tabulation, Recording Corporation" was quite complicated.
It took the name IBM in 1924. Originally it was the name of the brand used for the company's branches in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, the history of which begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the legendary "table clock", i.e. the clock that fixes the time when employees come and go from work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who until 1930 also headed the board of trustees of the company.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the director of a rival company, to help him run the company.
Then the CEO pushed the founder of IBM into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of an unshakable corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, started with the production and sale of various equipment for business - from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson’s leadership, revenue doubled to $9 million, and the company began a large-scale expansion to all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later, his son, Thomas Watson Jr., took his place in the director's chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control spaceflights – to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 – man’s flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which defined the computer standards of the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously buying the consulting department of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus fully concentrating on consulting and services with high added value.
Over the past three years, IBM has made great strides with its Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to use technology wisely in areas where this has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban governance.
In commerce, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire trading cycle.
IBM’s traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country simultaneously located in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is headquartered in Prague, where a world-class speech recognition research team also works.
Rachtarzhova about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Rikhtarzhova (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richter (53) became the bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and has outlined clear rules for her future life.
“Pepa can come home, but not as my partner,” Rikhtarzhova explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova provided Bartoszova with shelter in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Iveta to leave Rzic after 30 days, Pep did not leave the singer.
In fact, he publicly admitted that he loved her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to accept her husband's affair; and now she finally said goodbye to him.
I don't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richtarzh and Bartoshov ever parted, his wife would not accept him with open arms.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will drive him out.”
"However, he will end his days not as my favorite, lost and found old fool, but as a person with whom something connects me," Richtarzhova said, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
As long as Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that."
“My wife has decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision.”
“Our union is still in operation; I am in charge of repair, garden, house and shopping.”
“Darina and I communicate perfectly normally, only we don’t share the bed anymore,” Richter told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Rikhtarzhova finds a new love, he will not interfere with her.
“We don’t sleep together, and I don’t care where she goes, with whom or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I'm fully responsible," he said.
Worst Women's Habits: Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some typical bad female habits, they usually list them all at once.
Dear ladies, will you recognize yourself in the following lines, describing several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping (disambiguation)
Is your spouse complaining that you are constantly shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at big sales?
If so, then your shopping can be considered a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to somehow control their passion for shopping.
And yet, who among you will refuse to go shopping for clothes in search of perfectly sitting clothes and try it (preferably in different colors) in fittings?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you told your other half to wait outside for you...
Eternal dissatisfaction
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five kilograms - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah? Yeah.
Then you are part of a group of women who are obsessed with their appearance.
Not that you need to stop looking after yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the constant complaints of their partner about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women irritate them.
The most important thing is order and cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Washing the glass, cleaning with a vacuum cleaner, washing the floor, wiping the dust, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
Are you criticizing your partner for stepping on a clean tile in dirty shoes; kids for the dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on the window sill in the living room that was so difficult to clean?
If you suffer from this “deviation,” try to realize that it is not good to go to extremes; and that order and cleanliness should not come first in your family.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as your entire family.
Aspiration to Command
"Throw your underwear in the basket."
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet towels for dishes should not lie on the floor."
If you make comments to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Perhaps if men understood this, women wouldn’t have to command them so often.
Gossip
Some women like to gossip, insult, and weave intrigues against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how and why.
Every once in a while, we all gossip.
Let’s be honest, that’s the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others. They, especially in the women's working group, pose a great danger to their environment.
The successful transmissions of Yagra and Voracek helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transfers of hockey striker Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r Jagr helped Philadelphia beat 5:3 on the ice of Carolina. He again became the most successful Czech player of the match.
In both cases, Claude Giroud used the experience of a thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another transmission and was named the best player of the match.
Two successful transfers of the match also belonged to Yagr Yakub Vorachek, who played in the same team.
After the match, Jagr told foreign reporters that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"I told him before the match that he would score a hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel things like that," Jagr explained, after whose actions Giroux scored a goal at the first opportunity Flyers gave.
A little later, the second goal of the team also had a "Czech track".
Locking Harrikeins Voracek took possession of the puck and handed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the circles.
A second before the first break, home player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with a numerical advantage, but at the beginning of the second half the Flyers again led.
Especially the fat.
Following Yagra's successful pitch, he scored a third goal; later his goal was converted into a fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
“I like to play with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three," Jagr said, praising his centre-back.
“I never thought at the end of my career I would play with a hockey player like him.
“It makes me happy.”
"I want to support him."
“All these years in the NHL my teammates tried to help me, and now it’s my turn,” he added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Ruutu and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger did a great job in our area."
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed moved to the far end."
“I was aiming for him and I’m glad that it worked,” Voracek described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal defender Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not finish the match against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper body injury.
Together with an experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 2–3 after a penalty shootout.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec could not score during one of their attacks.
More than losing points, the home coach was saddened by the large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended with only five defenders.
“The situation is bad.”
“We finished the match with only one experienced player, the rest were young people.
“However, there’s nothing we can do about it, we just have to put up with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement by replacement, it was amazing and we couldn't resist."
"We needed to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone."
"What was our weakness," added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec helped Winnipegz defeat Tampa Bay 5:2.
The goals of the Jets, which interrupted a five-game series of defeats, were scored by five different players.
The dynamics of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, only five state-owned travel agencies could operate in the former Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was severely restricted, travel agencies at the time mostly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, on vacation, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which entailed significant restrictions on the travel of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was necessary; otherwise an individual trip was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered travel to the West, but it was necessary to either stand in line all night, with a sleeping bag, or have “good friends” at the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permit was required for travel to the West. It was not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often, the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this habit continues to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic, thus, experienced a real revolution.
While until 1989 vacations in the GDR or Bulgaria were the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we are no longer aware of is that, until 1989, we could not freely visit Croatia, currently the most popular, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the need to obtain a visa to the neighboring countries of Western Europe was abolished. This marked the beginning of a huge wave of short trips mainly to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their trips to the West. Everyone wanted to go there at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism at that time was the desire to bring their own food (canned, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of a freely convertible Czech krona. After decades, our tourists can finally freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which around 1997 led to another important circumstance.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to prepare regular flights operated by charter airlines. Compared to the past, flights have now become incredibly cheap due to the ability to book wholesale discounts.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs did not need a visa to visit almost all the developed world countries except the United States. This made our travels even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000. The great demand led to the historically first direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights take Czech tourists to warm exotic countries. This winter, flights from the Czech Republic will depart to twelve exotic destinations.
Currently, about 100 thousand Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the need to obtain a visa for Czech tourists. Our country thus forever joined the most developed world countries.
For the first time in history in 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 kroner per person for vacation abroad, including their expenses at their destination.
The general assembly must choose the president, the threat of the pat returns
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president. There is a risk that Ivan Gasek's successor, the head of the Czech football association (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will be held in Nimburk on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement as to which electoral rules to follow.
Without this, voting for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are eager to lead Czech football.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned from his post in June. Leaving, he urged his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, the Haschek era has once again plunged football into discord between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became quite obvious on September 16, when it was necessary to elect a new president.
The delegates of the general assembly arrived in vain at the National House in Prague, Smichov, as the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the election procedure.
There was no agreement as to who had the right to vote at the general meeting - only the legal representatives or also the officials to whom the powers had been granted.
This point has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation based on the powers granted is not possible.
Disputes over the rules of the election, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help much, although at its meetings, both regular and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
The views on voting methods have changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is: how to move to the 3rd round and avoid the pit?
“The dispute is whether to follow the established norms or to find another model,” said Dusan Svoboda, one of the vice presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R, who represents professional football in the association’s management.
Based on the model provided for in the charter, the winner of the third round is a candidate who has received a lot of support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees to a compromise - to consider the winner of the election the candidate with the largest number of the total number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that in the total percentage ratio the winner must get at least two-thirds of the votes.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with the arguments of Moravia. He says that it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with existing norms.
Somewhat unexpectedly, Tomasz Paclik agrees with his opinion, although the rules of the election, determined by the charter, suit Pelt more than other candidates.
"I would like to see the elections go as far as possible according to the statute."
"I want to avoid all sorts of representative stupidity, as at the previous general meeting," says owner Victoria Pilsen, who is a candidate for the first time; and in his statements, he largely contradicted Pelt.
Pelt remains an optimist.
He believes that the new president will be known in Nymburk; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
“All the emotional ferment will calm down after today’s expected release of the national team in the European Championship.”
"Football will be on a happy wave again, people will be more willing to cooperate," says the representative of Yablonets. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
“I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very ambiguous.”
“This is not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules.”
"This could cause another breakdown of the general assembly."
"I hope common sense wins," Reichl said.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, individual negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was to deliver, among others, the Vice Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Reichl to Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction. They were looking for an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of the replay match.
After all, the ministerial meeting, which is expected on Wednesday, could be crucial.
Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like the opposing parties within the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV with the new Czech sports directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik enters the presidential fight because he does not see a suitable candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the Pilsen players Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paclik would see a strong candidate that would meet all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not even claim a high position.
“If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself.”
"But such a person has not yet been found," Paclik told <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
Paclik’s motive for entering the fight against Miroslav Pelta and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl is to try to prevent Pelta, the alleged favorite of the elections, from entering the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R administration.
Moreover, Paclik emphasizes that in case of victory, he will remain president only until 2013, when the next general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this position to be held by an experienced top manager who is not too connected with football life.
"I've talked to a few people that might be in mind."
“It was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at the moment they don’t even want to be involved in Czech football.
“I would like to change that opinion,” he said.
At present, Paclik's main disagreement with Pelta is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berber, president of the regional football association in Pilsen. Berber is a man of controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the voices of delegates of the general assembly.
Paclik, therefore, considers it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward."
“With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more detrimental to football,” Paclick said.
He hints at the fact that a few years ago, Pelta's name was recorded while tapping phones in an investigation of a corruption case; Pelta managed to escape the sentence.
“I don’t know what prestige Pelt’s victory would bring to football.
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclick. He now does not mention his previous statement that he will "sell the club Plzen if Pelta becomes president".
If Paclick wins on Thursday, he could imagine collaborating with Pelta in the future.
This opinion is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Paclik supported in front of a general meeting in September, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very capable.'
“I can represent him at the head of the national team.”
"But he can't run the association."
“I also don’t stick my nose in what I don’t know,” said Paclik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of the judge brigade headed by Ludek Matzela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclick claims he risks running the association.
He cites his experience in managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Pilsen team, which with his help celebrated its first triumph in the league in May.
“I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change for the better.”
"To limit the influence of certain groups of persons who tend to exert influence on the disciplinary and appeal council, which leads to disgusting situations," Paclik said. He does not hide his antipathy, for example, to the Director of Sparta Daniel Krzhetinsky.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FA<0xC4><0x8C>R and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level for the allocation of more money for sports from lottery fees.
“This is one of the key issues that the new president must address.”
“If gambling is taxed, as political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they should clearly state where the money will go,” he said.
Paclik does not consider his connection to the club Pilsen a burden, although he argues that the president of FACR should be independent.
Pelta is associated with Jablonec, and Reichl with Prague Dukla.
“This is not an ideal option.”
"And yet I don't see the point in hypocritical transferring my shares of the club Plzen to someone else, since I'm going to go back there in six months," says Paclik.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R rules that will avoid Elective Pat
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FACR rules in order to avoid disputes over the election rules in the future.
Prior to Thursday’s talks in Nymburk, the Jablonec official remains optimistic and believes that the attention from the election will significantly distract from today’s expected success of our football team.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he wins, he will focus on both representation and receiving funds.
He decided to take part in the election at the last moment before the last general meeting. A two-month delay could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a broader context.
“People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday.”
“They feel that now is the time for someone to head the association,” says the man, mainly associated with the Jablonec club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the association’s executive committee.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
“Unfortunately, rules that weren’t as perfect as we all thought were adopted at a general meeting in June.”
"If different ways of representation had not been adopted, we would have had a president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to the rewrite of a key civil association document as a false target for delegates.
“If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt fails.”
“This is a fundamental issue without which we cannot exist,” Pelta says.
In addition, he says that he is not trying to stand out from his rivals.
In the past, he has stated that he can present his cooperation with Jindrich Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is fully aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Paclick, who constantly criticized Pelt.
“He’s been in football for over a year and has had some success.
“However, his attacks were indecent and many people were surprised by his campaign methods.”
"More and therefore some of them now doubt his true identity," Pelta said of his competitor. Pelta himself claims that he is faithful to the declarations he announced in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team must represent the whole football.
“I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the Bohemians or the consequences of last year’s corruption scandal.”
“Immediately after that, I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee enough money for the entire football,” the 46-year-old candidate told <0xC4><0x8C>TK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of football head would not lead to layoffs of staff.
"I will need to know the job descriptions of individual employees." This was his message to the Insurance, where the prolonged period of inter-government causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the planned general meeting, he believes that on Thursday the delegates will come to Nimburk not in vain.
“If the only issue is how to hold the election in the third round, we can handle it.”
“Football needs the confidence it can only gain by finally choosing its leader,” says Pelta, who remains an optimist two days before a key day in his career.
Reichl promises that under his leadership FA<0xC4><0x8C>R will begin to work actively
If at a meeting on Thursday, Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Reichl, the current vice president, becomes the president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association are rumored to be dissatisfied.
Reichl promises that if he is elected, there will be a time of hard work.
He wants to establish changes in the system and make members of the executive committee responsible for certain areas in football.
He also promises to solve the problem of the Bohemians; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole.”
“From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national teams, professional football and youth football events.”
“I don’t want to say I’ll do it all myself,” Reichl said in an interview with <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
“I’m a team player and I want to distribute the powers in the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area.”
“I will carefully distribute the tasks so that in each of these segments, football takes big steps forward.”
“It probably won’t appeal to many people, as it will mean hard work, not just criticism of the work of others,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidacy.
“I know I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know if it makes any sense; and that I will not be surrounded by people who put sticks in my wheels and question my every move," he explained.
"However, many people have told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
“It’s a trust that I can’t give up,” he said.
Moreover, he says that his motivation is to continue the work he started with Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don’t want to override it.”
"Procedures have been initiated that can bring results in a few years, and I do not want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association may return to the one that was before Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
“I believe in a systematic approach, and that’s something Mirek Pelt is unlikely to be competent in.”
“It’s surrounded by people who would play football in a way that is only accessible to the elect.”
"I can be accused of many things, but certainly not of subjectivity."
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just the chosen minority,” Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies accusations that he will only be the president of the Czech Republic.
“Although many people try to say the opposite, I plan to do the most for Moravia.”
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Reichl said.
While Plze<0xC5><0x88> manager Tomas Paclik entered the presidential fight, Reichl did not dare to assess his chances of winning.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes," Reichl said. To his successes he attributes savings of tens of millions of crowns on unprofitable contracts, negotiations on contracts with television and negotiations on the law on the lottery.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that there is no unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning creditworthiness to Czech football", he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
“No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen this year.”
“If he is elected, I hope that he will continue what Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started without significant personnel changes in the committees.”
“He wouldn’t distort the facts for his own benefit,” Reichl said of his rival.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the water
Yulia Stanek
Children's pools with universal fiber optics and status pools in Budapest. Travellers can try the incredible water of Europe - and relax the tired body in the jacuzzi after a city tour or walk.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Iris Meder could not do without one thing during her research trips for the last year and a half: without her swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she looked up at the tastefully decorated domes, sailed to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
She was in a hurry to add every pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 swimming pools – and now has collected impressions in her recently published book Badefreunden (The Joys of Bathing), which includes everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic swimming palaces in the Black Forest and “functional concrete buildings” in Taunus.
Her "trip to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries. In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true swim culture enthusiast.
She has very little enthusiasm for the sport, Meder says, but the water is different.
The only drawback is that swim fans have to put up with blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while runners can breathe the tempting smell of coniferous forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
“I once asked myself why swimming pools should always be so terrible,” says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Slap in the pool and refined oils in the sauna - the health factor in baths is so significant, because, according to Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be a real pleasure for the eyes, if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the floor in the pool, you have the surface of water."
“The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building.”
Everything is visually reflected: high ceilings, colored tiles and springboards.
The 190-page illustrated edition of Bathing Joy contains valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases – and makes you want to jump into the water.
Reservoir collector Meder discovered several outstanding specimens during a study in Hungary.
She discovered nitrate-rich water in a karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolec) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (V<0xC3><0xA1>rosi Term<0xC3><0xA1>lfürdö in Yasberen), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old baths.
From the many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, there is a stunning view. You can see the whole of Zurich from the rooftop bathing area or view the snow-covered Arlberg from the outdoor pool in St. Anton. And in the steam room there is a window that allows you to see what is happening on the ski.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld. The Aqua Cathedral in Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rises from it, which seem very small against the background of the Etztal Mountains.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The pool collector Meder did not find the smell of chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell of gray. The baths named after Arpad in Beke<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ab smell so much of oil that it can be difficult for you to believe that you are in a wellness source.
The smell is caused by hydrocarbonates in alkaline water. The water is almost black from the silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool - a health experience of a certain type.
Iris Meder, however, at some point was disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the outdoor pool of the Czech baths in Luga<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she found that the territory was sealed.
The baths, designed by architect Dusan Yurkovich in 1902, were closed.
When Meder looked into the windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald is the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already passed through three stages of construction. You will find not only neo-Romanesque elements of the period after construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, added around 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace – the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder – and not only because it is native to the Black Forest.
“It’s a real achievement to combine such different architectural styles so skillfully,” says Meder.
Plunging into a thermal pool in a palace like this is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural products
Deutsche Bank is investigating the trade in agricultural products.
Christian Theves
Will Deutsche Bank stop selling agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Ackermann tasked the working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The Executive Director plans to make changes in January.
Hamburg - Hamburg
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 percent of Germans consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products as trade exacerbates the problems facing the world’s poorest people.
The findings were drawn from a study conducted by the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on behalf of the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report’s author, Harald Schumann, demonstrates that betting on the world’s commodity exchanges raises prices – and banks are thus implicated in world hunger.
The campaign of consumer advocates is directed directly against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, although major banking houses such as Godman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are trading in the same way.
Initially, bets on goods were conceived as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
However, most experts now agree that players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand – and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism. He promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade "is worth putting the good reputation of Deutsche Bank at risk".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank Board of Managing Directors - with recommendations for action.
The head of the bank then plans to announce the changes, following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may decrease or stop altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode was pleased with the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector. "Bets on rising food prices are a blatant example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest."
As the main lobbyist of the bank, Ackermann has a certain duty, according to Bode.
“The Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's starving people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann’s quick reaction is surprising at first, but the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not move to the supervisory board as planned.
Repealing the controversial speculation in the food market could improve its image.
He also practically does not have to worry about expenses - with the consequences will have to deal with his successor.
One in two would refuse to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization’s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday. The study was conducted for the Forsa Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people took part.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits that ultimately lead to commodity speculation.
43% would recommend leaving the bank, 49% said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
The pavilion in a new place
Ingeborg Winsowski
Architectural history with ups, downs and a happy end. The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and was abandoned.
It is now being reopened as an exhibition centre.
The Austrian pavilion, designed by Carl Schwantzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, bold that expressed faith in technological progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix of Architecture in 1958 for its lightweight floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
In the end, he became famous around the world in 1973 for his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and her sister - a bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as a 20th-century museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "Twentieth-Century House" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not have walls on which to hang works of art, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna received a new home.
The house had been empty since 2001, and his condition was getting worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krischanitz has so far restored the pavilion, which has been dubbed the "21st Century House" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in all senses a joyful event.
Agnes Husslein-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, contributed to the new venture.
Husslein-Arco, a graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Salzburg, convinced politicians and custodians to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made a decision about how to
The new museum was to accommodate the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Wotruba Foundation, a cafe and a bookstore along with modern art. An office building was also to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Secession by Josef Olbrich, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was an "extremely important place" for him, where he attended exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that stood in front of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last reconstruction were much more serious. The building was an "energy absorber", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, a fiberglass-reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced by a high-strength safety glass.
The steel beams of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created a space for new use of the building, a fallen light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still an elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it used to be.
All this under strict control of the museum management and with a limited budget.
“We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would have been approved by the museum department,” Krischanitz says, pointing to the uneven flooring in the basement.
The building remained flexible and light despite constraints, challenges and transformations.
Krischanitz recently remarked that the pavilion "from Brussels" was rough - a typical story of "drops in the city".
Such architecture is “always out of place” and yet wants to “stimulate real awareness.”
The house of the 21st century is in the very right place, because when planning the city happened unexpected luck. A completely redesigned "main station district" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur. The 21st-century house may be complemented by Krishanitz’s second building – collector Francesca von Habsburg purchased Berlin’s Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reportedly in talks with the city to position it next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans multimillion-dollar winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid train cancellations in the winter.
The number of employees should double.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter train cancellations and delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn’s internal anti-crisis plan, Bild reports that a total investment of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million is planned until 2015.
The investments are designed to improve the efficiency of locomotives and the railway network, even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and engaged employees involved in snow removal from roads and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the required shooters within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger transport, as it lacked reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many new regional trains awaited the approval of the Federal Railway Service for years.
There were also some delays with the delivery of ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of ICE trains much more often over the years after one of the ICE trains broke the axle at Cologne’s main train station.
Deutsche Bank to pay <0xC2><0xA3>1million fine in U.S.
New troubles have come after the unrest around Josef Ackermann, CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank faces a fine in the United States of many millions of pounds.
As if Deutsche Bank had little trouble at home, the past of the industrial giant in the United States has now overtaken it. Deutsche Bank headquartered in Frankfurt will pay $145 million (106 million euros) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
The problem arose around the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Authority (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
“We are pleased that we have resolved this problem without the parties going to court,” Deutsche Bank said in a statement.
In the agreement, the bank did not admit its guilt.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matts welcomed the prompt response from both banks.
The National Credit Unions Authority (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer deposits.
The NCUA is fighting for compensation for the losses, which are poured out with billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks and filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
Doubtful mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They are backed by internal loans.
This decided the fate of a number of financial companies when in 2007 burst the bubble in the real estate market in the United States.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the crest of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still battling the storm.
Investors and regulators have put forward a large number of claims, demanding compensation or punishment of fraudsters.
Behind the biggest wave of claims is the Federal Agency for Housing Financing (FHFA).
It accuses the 18 largest international banks of having acquired collateral for about $200 billion from American credit institutions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Deutsche Bank also faces prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for “substantial losses” but has not yet specified the exact amount.
The Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests $10 billion in IBM
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always stated that he does not invest in computer and IT companies, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM’s annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
According to Buffett, he should have realized much earlier that IBM primarily offers services and buys computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett’s investments were seen as a knightly act.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title of "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he bought shares of IBM for a total of 10.7 billion dollars.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM until recently knew nothing about his involvement.
He praised the management, who managed to make a profit even during the financial crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
For a considerable time, IBM has focused on high-yield IT services such as data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, who is now more than 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
So far, Buffett has avoided tech companies.
He said that he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight rail transport, in the production of lubricants and in mechanical engineering.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rück), along with some 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquired Berkshire Hathaway, a small textile company, in the 1960s, and built one of the most expensive companies in the world with the help of skillful investments.
His way of life, however, remained modest,
He has become a cult figure for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible instinct for making money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
IBM’s stock price rose 1 percent before markets opened after Buffett’s investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is also called, is worth more than $220 billion on the stock market, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, said he was not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
Imminent danger
After the discovery of the "cell in Zwickau" Turkish media began to doubt the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers speaks of a “blood ideology” that is now rising to the surface again.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of a right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and concern were a reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community of Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has brought to life long-forgotten fears. There have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There has never been any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network now discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The Revival of Bloody Ideology?" was the headline of the online version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret informant of the secret services, and expresses concern that the German authorities may find themselves dragged into a right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly, commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a tacit picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral labour agreement in a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
The cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
Coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German publication Hürriyet also did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel.
"Begins to smell bad" is the title of Ahmet Kulahji's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful round-up were sharply criticized in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities hadn’t thought about tracking suspects in right-wing extremist circles before.
Some authors have come to rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as clumsy, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves armedly."
"It will be the best self-defense."
“The peace in Germany depends very much on how the entire network is opened and on the legitimacy of the punishment,” Selen writes.
The crimes in Mellen and Solingen in the 1990s were an example of how peace in Germany was threatened.
The photo of the burned ruins in Solingen is deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown so clearly to the Turks living here that they are in danger, and to the Germans that distrust and indifference can result in real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failures of the German police after the attacks. Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Mölln.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the burnings in Solingen, but his participation in the memorial ceremony in Cologne was received by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech counted the taxes that the Turks pay in Germany,
It is as if he has determined the value of a man by the taxes which he pays.
The current coverage in the Turkish media again showed how the mistrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
Clearly showing what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banking scandal on Lake Zurich
Most of Europe’s leading banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling with one crisis or another ever since.
Now the German has to take it back to the right course.
Alex Weber probably didn’t know he was going to get the part.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the post of head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he will start working in an equally spectacular position - the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; an unexpected and profitable career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and making some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better."
“I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel.”
But in September it became clear that everything would be completely different.
The UBS trader in London bypassed the bank’s security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grubel, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to resign.
Since then, the chairman of the board of directors of UBS is considered sick, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, he will take the post of chairman of the council in May, not in 2013.
It's not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist of the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He suddenly found himself responsible for the bank’s strategy, which once again proved that he had long earned the title of “the biggest banking scandal in Europe.”
UBS, on the one hand, is very large – until recently, it managed the largest assets in the world – and, on the other hand, it has not emerged from scandals for years.
It seems that the proud Swiss bank spares nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a stealth and sustainable but at the same time agile asset manager with ambitious goals and the desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus having in management more money of wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
and as an investment bank entered the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking who has long taught at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich, explains: “I have always brought my students UBS as a sample of a good bank.”
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask how I could have been so wrong."
He was really wrong.
It was only in 2007 that it became clear that something was going wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffley — who was considered an outstanding intellectual and equally brilliant banker — abruptly stepped down from his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment division of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS reported a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to counter the crisis.
The bank was indeed able to find investors — but investors, which many bankers would have politely refused recently — one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that even its name was not disclosed.
It was only the first blow.
In April 2008, things got a lot worse.
The bank had to announce new billion-dollar losses, and the chairman of the board, Marcel Ospel, the second-highest-paid chairman of the board in Switzerland in 2006, resigned.
In October 2008, there was a disaster. Due to a lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was faced with a threat of collapse, and the state had to save it.
The National Bank bought toxic securities for an undisclosed amount of billions from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with a mandatory conversion to become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country realized the dramatic consequences of the fact that huge banks had settled in a small country.
After all, the final balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was five times larger than all of Switzerland’s production (see chart).
“We won’t be able to save UBS a second time,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the U.S. and said it was ready to hand over data from wealthy customers who may have been evading taxes with the help of the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursing undue business revenue plus fines.
UBS thus more or less admitted to being a tax evasion tool.
At the same time, UBS has lost what has always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy customers – the veil of secrecy.
After this scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same as before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors then resigned, and
The customer’s money has started.
Over the past few months, the bank has lost confidence in both main areas of its operations – in investing due to failed speculation and in asset management as a result of aid and encouragement of tax evasion.
And only everything calmed down and it began to seem that UBS managed to turn the situation around, as happened this crash with the scammer trader. A single trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed that something was wrong.
One thing is clear - risk management in the investment department is not yet working.
“The Adoboli incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough,” says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of Germany’s largest banks also has no doubt: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t have a risk control tool.”
It is caution that has long made Swiss bankers the custodians of the world’s largest assets – not an unnecessary risk, but a security for money, whether the world has collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
Swiss bank safes have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste in chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still fits the image of a worthy Swiss private bank – only it’s a little bigger.
Its location is a classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on the Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rental rates for shops are some of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find jewelry firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been located here for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse and elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
A heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas. Next to the emblem of the bank is a large pointer "Safe".
UBS knows what its customers need – reliability.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concepts of banking – or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss bankers, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - in particular, in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
The Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if there is something, then they have long adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits - and then a fiasco. No other financial institution in Europe has lost as much money in the jungle of sub-assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
“On that Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country with a population of seven million people undertook the largest rescue operation in the country’s history,” Lukas Hassig wrote in his book The Crash of UBS.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could it have come to that?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed that was already too big for little Switzerland at the time of the merger – and a bank that continued to grow.
This was helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS complemented each other. One was a rich but high-level bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
Internationalized investment bankers suddenly gained access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the omnipotent wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wulffley, Executive Director of UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I’ve always believed that Wulffley and Ospel are a dream team,” says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wolffley, an outstanding intellectual, modest and profoundly understanding of models and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, has come all the way up, starting with an intern in a bank."
But Ospel eventually relied on Wulffley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the meetings of board members, at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to move Goldman Sachs.
The U.S. Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he headed the “turnier table”, where the successes of the banks were brought.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make part of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weak spot. By the parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failures in U.S. mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
Striving for growth, the bank itself and the hedge fund it founded invested in U.S. substandard securities.
This evolved into a large mechanism that combined securities based on U.S. mortgages and sold them further – continuing to bear the risks itself.
Even when other banks have long been looking for a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
“UBS was buying until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire,” says banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the growth, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as attempts to put the bank in order proved more difficult than it seemed at first.
Posts at UBS have turned into a children’s game with chairs and to this day remain unreliable.
Anyone who heads this huge bank faces an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Banking analyst Geiger already has an idea – to abandon investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about their Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not yet ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activities need to be significantly curtailed.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually seen only as a temporary solution when the bank suddenly broke up with his predecessor, Grubel.
Over time, he has managed to show the character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, heads UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernotty plans to bring the investment bank back to the state it was in in the mid-1990s.
It cuts 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What is UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably asked by Axel Weber.
In public, he has so far only said that he and his wife are looking for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe are dragging down the US stock exchange
The impending recession in Europe worsened the mood of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis can be overcome in the bud.
The general relief that followed the changes of governments in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half full rather than half empty — but now the problems are again coming to the fore, said Mark Luskini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were on sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index closed at 12.078 with a 0.6 percent drop.
The market barometer in the course of trading fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The wider S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, falling by one percent.
The Nasdaq technology index lost 0.8 percent, trading at 2,657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in 17 countries of the euro area has significantly reduced production and is adapting to the end of growth.
The statistical service Eurostat reported that in September the companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
This message has thrown American investors into skepticism. "We are not on an island. We depend on them," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe is unlikely to shake off the recession quickly and that banks are showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett was only able to confirm these fears. In an interview with CNBC, he said that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything it takes to end the crisis.
Therefore, in his opinion, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the trash can and invested in America’s high-tech industry.
His more than $10 billion investment in IBM raised the stock price of the oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The shares closed, almost unchanged, at the level of 187.35 dollars.
Buffett said he paid an average of $170 per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathway fell by 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The bank converted almost all of its remaining share of the China Construction Bank into cash, earning $6.6 billion.
The bank mainly plans to maintain its capital quota with net profit from sales in order to comply with stricter regulations.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing won, reducing losses on the Dow-Jones.
The stock price rose 1.5 percent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.
On Sunday, Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777-series aircraft worth a total of $18 billion.
Including the option to purchase another 20 aircraft, the total volume is actually $26 billion.
Approximately 710 million shares have changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange.
Shares of 719 companies rose, 2,281 fell and 79 remained at the same level.
Shares of 630 companies ended trading with growth, 1913 with a decline and 82 remained at the same level on Nasdaq with a turnover of 1.38 billion shares.
Smart Crows Fill Cities
Graches are considered problematic birds in many places. Experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to drive out of cities.
Some love birds, others would like to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents complaining of dirt and noise in many settlements are becoming more and more.
The problem of birds, however, has not yet been solved.
At the first symposium on crows, in the city of Ler in East Friesland, experts argued that it was no longer possible to expel the crows from the cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for Alternatives in Cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected turf, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, expanding construction and the felling of traditional nesting trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the city of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz, Achim near Bremen and Leer, there are large colonies of more than 600 parent couples.
The controversial project of shooting crows in Lehre caused disapproval of the headlines in 2005.
Critics have described catching birds in traps and hammering them with sticks as a particular cruelty.
“Normal displacement and intimidation don’t do anything,” said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Lehr.
Beating nests with jets of water or cutting trees often have undesirable consequences, said environmentalist Manfred Kaiser from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals disperse, and large colonies divide and spread to other areas.”
Bullying is possible only in the form of exceptions near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We will have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option."
Separately from the surrounding areas, the problem in cities will not be solved, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kölner.
A combination of scaring birds away from sheltered areas and encouraging them to return to other areas could be a way out.
"Information stands instead of chainsaws" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We need to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem."
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational crow route in Ascherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the life of highly intelligent turtles is given on information stands.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed her opinion on complaints about noise produced by birds. "Noise transmits a lot of information. They have a lot to say to each other."
The mind and wit of these birds have entered the legends. Gracius often not only use the tools to take possession of a good-looking piece, but also make the tools themselves.
Behavior researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested a measure of bird’s mind on four grates.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they had to tap the board to get the moth larvae.
Without much training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the board.
In another experiment, intelligent graters had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larvae in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not get the prey with a beak.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used wire to make hooks and used hooks to hook the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three out of four players managed to do this on their first try.
Ronaldo leads Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks to win at the last minute were not long held.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championships.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with a score of 6:2 (2:1), perfectly shaping its fifth exit to the Euro after 0:0 in the first stage.
The Czechs had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against the outsider of Montenegro after a net victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss their chance, playing 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland easily scored 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.
Former professional Bundesliga player from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovi<0xC4><0x87> and captain Emir Spahi<0xC4><0x87> reduced the difference by two points thanks to the effective penalty in the 41st minute and a goal in the 65th for Bosnia.
Sena Luli<0xC4><0x87> received the second yellow card in the 54th minute.
Portugal has already knocked Bosnia out of the 2010 World Cup playoffs in South Africa.
Portugal made an excellent start at Estadio da Luz in Lisbon.
Ronaldo took the early start, making a free kick into the goal from about 30 meters.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani demonstrated his long-range abilities, from the 25-meter mark, increasing the score to 2: 0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half hour, got their first chance thanks to the striker Edin Djeko.
Former Wolfsburg player from the leader of the English championship Manchester City in the 33rd minute sent the ball head to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Jiracek scored for the Czech Republic
Then the focus was on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding.
Following the attack on Elder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute, Stark decided that the Portuguese player simulated, and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for playing by hand after Fabio Cuentran's foul - Misimovic implemented it.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champions scored another four goals.
Petr Jiracek dispelled all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are heading to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled at coach Michal Bilek's team and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlets (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the beginning that could have been catastrophic.
The goalkeeper Petr Cech in the 9th minute thanks to an instant reflex prevented a potential auto goal of Tomasz Sivok.
Montenegro's best chances were when the duo of Stevan Joveti<0xC4><0x87> and Dejan Damjanovi<0xC4><0x87> were on the field.
Damjanovic in the 40th minute struck from the edge of the penalty area and almost scored a goal to the Czech Republic.
After the break, the bar saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper Chech after the striker FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now little doubt that national team coach Gus Hiddink will now vacate a seat on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002, the Croats are in the final round of the European Championship for the fourth time.
The Turks almost managed to start perfectly in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maximir Stadium.
A long shot of Seljuk Inan in the seventh minute hit the rack, and the striker Kazym Kazym failed to hit the ball in the net.
Croatia then woke up and increasingly took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legionnaires Daniel Prani<0xC4><0x87> (Bayern, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field together with Mario Mand<0xC5><0xBE>uki<0xC4><0x87> of the Wolfsburg team, who lost to Ivan Peri<0xC5><0xA1>i<0xC4><0x87> from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro entry since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - who already looked confident in their place after winning 4-0 in the first stage - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal by Stephen Ward.
Konstantin Vasiliev from the team of guests equalized the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland took a good pace from the start, but only in the 23rd minute Robbie Keen from Los Angeles made the first clean goal
At the last moment, the Estonian defender managed to prevent him from bringing Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing the defense of goalkeeper Paul Londonk, Ward was in the right place and, dropping the ball across the line, changed the score to 1: 0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe’s largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and nearly double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said on Thursday it plans to invest about $2 billion (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
“We will create more research and development opportunities and employ thousands of people,” Bill McDermott, one of SAP’s chief executives, said in a statement at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.
The staff of 2,500 people should grow to 4,500.
The leader of the global industrial software market plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of more than 176,000 worldwide.
The growth of China is an important component of the company’s 2015 strategy, which is included in the Dax listing.
SAP plans to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Waldorf company earned around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12.5 billion.
The business of a software provider with 55,000 employees around the world looks better than ever.
SAP has been present in China for 20 years.
“Now we want to change the scale of our operations,” McDermott said.
“Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by relying on informatization in China.”
Mass murder - the human dimension
Peter Englund’s intense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of actors from which the heart freezes.
Here’s a tip on how to read further: Carefully cut out this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund’s story unfolds, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon at times when, like one of these men and women, you will get out of the way and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as “working on anti-history.”
It has few known names, important treaties, or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, agile journalists, or discussions of tactics and military equipment.
It's not so much a book about what was, it's a book about what it was like, it's about "feelings, impressions, experiences, and the state of mind."
The book "Beauty and Sorrow" weaved together the experience of the war years of 20 more or less unremarkable men and women, on both sides of the front line, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone gets captured, loses a hand or a leg, goes crazy or dies.
Their lives flicker here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some are extinguished at this time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is also an amendment to the notion that the First World War was only a severe trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and sorrow" skilfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall bee hives; one of them celebrates Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unresolved problem is tsetse flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, smelling smokeless gunpowder.
When you hear the cannonade and you're a woman and you're at home with your kids, will you stay put or run away?
Anyway, who's coming?
Almost no one understands what is going on and why it is necessary to fight in this war.
“The lack of facts,” says Mr. Englund, “is filled with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, obsessions, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" traces the fate of such people as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are taken mainly from memoirs, letters and other materials already published.
The stories of their lives can be scary or exciting, but they are highly alive thanks to Mr. Englund's collected small moments and fragmentary details.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says: "Erzatz, everywhere Erzatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about Erzac food in Germany.
He describes “meat from pressed rice cooked in lamb fat (and decorated with fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peel; shoes beaten with wood.”
He notes that there were “837 registered meat substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes.”
Some stories tell of honor and courage.
One American notices in himself the craving for cruelty and says about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men were created for, and not to sit in comfortable chairs with a cigarette and a whiskey, an evening newspaper or a bestseller and claim that this show is a civilization and is under your crumbled shirt with buckles."
The British soldier, on the contrary, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or grieve.
“When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen in front of the public,” he writes.
But this is the opposite, terribly similar to "a condemned man who is hanged in secret."
Other remarks concern old Europe, which is collapsing, and new kinds of fear.
“Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “the war of the factories.”
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the beginning of the century: a beautifully expressed and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-stitched suit who arranges a massacre while sitting at a desk."
People act in an unforeseen way: lowly actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund spoke about the soldiers who tried in every way to catch sexually transmitted diseases from prostitutes in order to avoid serving at the front.
“The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea pus, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into the hospital,” he writes.
"Very desperate rubbed it in his eyes, which often led to lifelong blindness."
Mr. Englund’s prose, translated with Peter Graves of Sweden, is flexible but careless, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war “liberated completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People begin to ask why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often indirect, such as Paul Fassell's The Great War and Modern Memory, or novels such as Erich-Marie Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this uncharted pantheon.
His book has the most amazing ending that I can remember in non-fiction.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it’s like he reached the page with a list of characters from the book, took it out of your hands and lit it with a match.
After the previous error - carefully calculated raid
The operation involved hundreds of police officers, some wearing protective helmets.
The night hours from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because Zucotti Park was supposed to be the least crowded at that time.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, the others were first told that they were going to exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the events, his presence underscored the importance the Police Department attached to the operation.
There could be no question of repeating episodes of recent weeks such as the use of peppermint gas against protesters, which was contrary to the rules of the department and caused a hurricane of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So, after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation began to liberate Zukotti Park from protesters.
The authorities were preparing, watching how the occupation unfolded in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were held on Randels Island with the expectation of Zucotti.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid displacement of a large number of police officers — referring to Lower Manhattan.
The last exercise took place on Monday evening on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at the "last minute", - said a source familiar with the orders, in which the task was referred to only as "training".
“The few cops I know who were summoned to this case were not told they were being sent to Zucotti Park,” said the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
“The only people who knew they were going to Zucotti Park were in the highest positions in the department.”
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but retreated in front of hundreds of protesters who rushed inside before the deadline, hearing about these plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including forces from the districts - a team of police officers who were usually used to control criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost like at work, come and leave the park during the day, making 1 hour of the night a good time to attack.
“It was right to do this when the park is the least crowded,” he said.
Rescue vehicles with spotlights and loudspeakers gathered at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The spotlights and pre-recorded announcements carried from loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When administrative officers in their blue windmills entered the park, many protesters simply packed their belongings and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, gathered around the perimeter to enter in case the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, a spokesman for the head of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they were not allowed to see how the police operate and that the police treated them rudely.
Mr. Brown said that cars with cameras on Church Street, along the park's western border, could take pictures.
When police marched west through a pile of protesters’ personal belongings, including bags, plastic mats and plastic bags full of clothes, the Sanitary Department’s teams followed her, collecting what had been dumped.
Some protesters, who refused to leave, were pulled out, photos of it soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took positions near the camp's kitchen, near the center of the park.
Some built barricades, and the police entered, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together by the hands.
And two people chained themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the castles, emergency services were called.
No arrests were made in the park until around 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The sweeping operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for “violation of public order and resistance to detention,” he said.
The most senior officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, head of the department and senior officer in the department.
Phil. T. Pulaski, the head of the department's detective department, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operation," Mr. Brown said.
A second group of police officers was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case they needed to get inside.
The fences were placed on Courtland Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw police from these positions extending the perimeter even further beyond the boundaries of Zucotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, ousting people even further.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one protester jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others said they were blowing air out of the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one policeman and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The union of serving staff of schools will sue the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school staff who lost seats last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students study.
Trial is probably the last tool available to a District Council union 37 attempting to overturn dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, a coordinator for work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their seats on October 7 as union leaders called a political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by labor groups to close a hole in the budget last spring.
City officials categorically denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed in June.
One council member parried, telling him that there were no indications in the budget that the school's support staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37th District Council said they had filed a complaint, warning the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against him; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal filing of the lawsuit with the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
The lawsuit will identify Mr. Walcott and the City's Department of Education as defendants and list the eight temporarily dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all black or Latino women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint at the disposal of the New York Times, the union has focused on a number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools have lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and there were few in the Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 auxiliary school workers lost their seats in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working at 36 free secondary school in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: “These are not areas of wealthy parents who can find money to fill budget gaps.”
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it counted additional funding for every poor student who entered school.
The union also argues that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice authorizing the dismissal of parental coordinators.
The notice used the word "excess", although "excess" is more often said when a teacher from the school's payroll moves to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents were fired,” the draft lawsuit says, “and not just transferred.”
The mission is over, Congress is ready for an agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (Democrat, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), which praises the Libyans for a “successful insurrection” and the U.S.
“The point of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is a confirmation of the support of their democratic aspirations on the part of both parties.”
The language may seem harmless, but no discussion on Libya has been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties argued with each other and with the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the U.S. military’s role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and never got a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
This left the American mission in a sort of legislative purgatory – when Congress is irritated enough to criticize Obama’s approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually knock the ground out of its feet.
Then the events overtook the indecision of the Congress
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was assassinated.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “wonders the people of Libya for their incredible courage and extraordinary perseverance in the pursuit of freedom” and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “reaffirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measures get full support from the Foreign Affairs Council or split lawmakers like the June bill?
The latest version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the leader of the Republicans in the Committee.
Luger’s spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
The measure, proposed by House of Representatives member Bob Goodlat (Republican, Virginia), would be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or anything else to be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this convocation.
Other lawmakers have not yet been able to table their amendments in plenary, but not because they have not tried.
The Goodlat amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that address a wide range of issues that have been introduced in this convocation.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments only in the House of Representatives and some more about “control over federal spending.”
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who want to decorate their resumes - the opportunity to brag that they "proposed" such a proposal.
The budget control act, which passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office of members of Congress, and House of Representatives member Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to lift the limit of two terms for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) has proposed many amendments that guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for many years, as well as another one banning the burning of a flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states object to them.
No matter how much the members of Congress have sought to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th, they introduced 66.
This pace is fading compared to the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they were not more successful than they are now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was approved in 1992, but it was actually made to Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated," Giffords says in his first television interview since the assassination attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot her in the spotlight at a public event in Tucson, House of Representatives member Gabrielle Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday night, blew up a melody from the Broadway show “The Sun Will Return Tomorrow” and said she wanted to get better than returning to Congress.
Appearing on the "20/20" ABC News with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate sentences and needed help walking.
The program showed her a difficult path of recovery from a bullet injury that shattered the skull and pierced the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the debt ceiling bill.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult."
Asked by Sawyer how she felt, 41-year-old Giffords replied, “Very good.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 hour special, which was shown on the eve of the release of the new book of the spouses Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.
The special edition spoke about the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on January 8.
In a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she lies on a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and physiotherapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
Nod your head.
Pull out your lips.
And then her first word was, "What."
A few days later, Giffords said the second word - "toast", a request to change the menu of breakfast.
The video shown by ABC shows that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see a congressman singing along with the doctors "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" by Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" by Tom Petty.
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, said she does not remember the day of the assassination attempt.
Her husband said he read Giffords an article in the newspaper about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed then.
Suspect assailant Jerd Lee Lafner is being held in a Missouri prison and subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords Sawyer said.
"Heavy, hard, hard."
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, “I’m defeated.”
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just beaten.
And you'll get through it, you'll get better, and you'll come back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more pity than respect.
The event was a holiday on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad of helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines lined up around him.
The audience in the tuxedo applauded him standing up.
“The soldiers were seen as heroes,” said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, which also featured the then Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
“They were treated like orphans,” the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect, it was pity.
The exact opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have been established between the army and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
Soldiers are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, say the military.
The public increasingly behaves as if they feel pity for people in uniform.
“We are not victims at all,” said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon leaving for Afghanistan.
“But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy.”
This is a sensitive topic for warlords who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger faced by returning troops in the last years of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and only between combat veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat as part of the Marine Corps, retired colonel Mark Canshen warned them that non-military men would look at their service from two points of view.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they crushed the rebels and visited exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is “a brutal evil veteran behind the mask,” said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and returned to take up a senior government post in Washington.
While looking for a job, he said, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking if he could withstand the stress of working responsibly in Washington right after the campaign.
Kenshin recalls how he told his sons, “When you talk about your service, you have to count on the negative effect.”
The embarrassment experienced by the military stems in part from American indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that is little acquainted with the army and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as we did in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Burnough, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mainly focused on the depth of the suffering of the soldier.
Troops are estimated by the number of campaigns they have made, by the number of comrades they have lost, or by the magnitude of the losses.
The army is facing increasing pressure from supporters of the fight against rape
This week’s historic court hearings will decide whether to accept a lawsuit by 28 men and women against the army on charges of non-resistance to rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up with the next one.
Private First Class Elizabeth Lyman, 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, was allegedly raped by her co-worker at night.
It was in October 2008, when she returned to her barracks at Miramar airfield, north of San Diego after dinner with a friend, and met a fellow man carrying a packet of 12 beer bottles.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
“It was a red flag,” Lyman says.
But the Texas native has retracted her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instincts."
A few minutes after they entered Lyman's room, a man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former servicemen will eagerly await the court’s decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by lawyer Susan Burke of Washington, D.C., initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but rose to 28 in the following months — 25 women and three men who all claim to have been raped or threatened with sexual violence by co-workers and that the army did not properly investigate, prosecute or prosecute after due process.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the army because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burke also says she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Its strategy: instead of gathering all the plaintiffs in this case — putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak — it will open up a lot of things if necessary to maintain pressure.
A defense team from the Department of Defense led by federal prosecutor Neil McBride has taken steps to end the case.
The court documents received by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy – mainly consisting in the fact that former or current soldiers cannot claim the army for damage suffered in the armed forces.
According to the doctrine referred to in the 1950 Supreme Court ruling by the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages caused by persons in military service.
“The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the military service of the plaintiffs,” the documents read.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
Result: 150 female soldiers died between the two wars, two-thirds of them in combat.
It’s also time for the army to become modern, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her lawsuit, three others are being prepared.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Law Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military academies on charges of promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, a nonprofit association of American veterans of the Vietnam War is preparing a lawsuit against the army, at the center of which are diagnoses of “personality changes” that are put to the victims of violence in order to remove them from service, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati from the human rights group Organization for the Action of Women Soldiers.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Affairs Office in December accusing it of discriminatory practices to consider applications for pensions from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate bills proposing a series of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Ministry of Trafficking’s Sexual Abuse Prevention and Control Service, 3,158 rape attempts were reported.
But, as you know, the attacks are often not reported, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates, this figure is about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of court cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of known cases went to court - twice as much as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case call the attacks on them only the first in a number of other injuries.
In the case of Lyman, she reported rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell the details of the rape 11 times separately to the fiancée of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the assailant - from the cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier in the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive characterization to the accused, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
"I thought I was having a baby right now - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I got out, I remember my commander saying, 'It wasn't a trial against him. It was a trial against me.'"
Lyman was ordered to go to a military psychiatrist who eventually diagnosed her with a personality change that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with an unfavourable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her classmates will move forward is a difficult question, says John Terley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: “In my opinion, they are able to move forward.”
Between them and the verdict is the doctrine that has been criticized since it came into being.
I've been criticizing the Feres Doctrine all my life.
The army has been lagging behind for decades because it does not have the incentives and deterrents it imposes.
He adds, “The odds are very much against them... but it’s important for them to try.”
These things will change only when decent people want to fight.
If the hearing is not in their favor, Burke, the plaintiff's attorney, will assemble hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform,” she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just an ordinary guy expressing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to the July massacre in Norway that killed 77 people, appeared at his first open court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack at his computer, communicating with the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, the researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
It's easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting to them is not difficult at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European cyber populism at the UK’s DEMOS Research Centre.
The stock of personal data on Facebook is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site’s advertising tool to highlight the necessary demographic with scientific accuracy – something marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million right-wing fans across Europe and then pushed them to advertise, but instead of showing them a new group or diet product, the ad asked the user to go through a survey that asked questions about their level of education, attitude to violence, and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 participants of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - even without leaving the office.
“It’s a whole new way to do research,” Bartlett says.
Some of the results are not as striking: right-wing online advocates are mostly young males dissatisfied with immigration.
But unexpectedly, “those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor.”
DEMOS’ work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to explore everything from health issues to social trends that are expressed in ‘Likes’, wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three posts per day, Facebook’s “super-update” information sparks a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with a site title in the headline by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it provides an opportunity to study people who cannot be approached on the street with a notebook.
“Earlier, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them.”
“You would have to join the party and they would never accept you,” Bartlett says.
“Facebook excludes all of this – you’re addressing them directly.”
Others say that with the help of this site it would be possible to identify and investigate social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more at risk of alcoholism than students who remained silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ peers, such as their dorm mentors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who updates drunken statuses too often.
“You can’t solve a problem without identifying it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children’s Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify children at risk who would not otherwise have been detected."
Facebook is also constantly extracting various kinds of data about its users.
The site’s data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine’s Day, midterm voter turnout in 2010, as well as the National Happiness Index (mainly using information that only they have access to – champions of cyber freedom have long insisted that the site should make its extensive data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for conducting offline research, online data is publicly available.
“I don’t think many users have even thought that a researcher might be watching their profiles,” says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, about a study he conducted in 2006 using public student pages on Facebook.
“As far as they could imagine, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the subject of the study is extremely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how much information in the profile and on the user's page is true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn said.
That’s why, despite years of work in technology research, Selvin thinks that a notebook and a pen are still the best research tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace going into the real world and communicating with real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about social, and much of social research is still happening offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik will appear in court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to organizing a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first public appearance in a Oslo court.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance and Knights Templars of Norway," he said in front of 500 people in the courtroom.
“I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I admit the actions, but I don't admit the guilt."
Judge Torkyel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought with him a pre-written speech, to address the victims' relatives at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, barred him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came here to find answers to their questions.
“I thought he looked cold and inhumane,” one survivor on Ut<0xC3><0xB8>ya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
“It was uncomfortable, but I personally felt a little better after I saw and heard the suspect.”
Dressed in a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked into the eyes of journalists and survivors as he walked in and out of the building.
Despite Breivik’s strange idea that he was part of a large “resistance” movement, the judge ruled that he was not crazy and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may find it reassuring that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of one extremist, not a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the grief and confusion that the entire nation is now feeling.
“I would like him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” a relative of one victim said.
“It would be a lot easier if it were so.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs’ Lost Interview Shown at the Theater This Week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider to be the biggest discovery in a newly discovered interview, recalled ahead of previews in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also the meticulous organizer and modernizer of the production process, who believed that many business executives suffered from the "disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea separates a huge amount of skillful work from a great product."
Back in 1995, Bob Kringle created the TV series Triumph of the Nerds about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more than an hour with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By that time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was kicked out of Apple, and he was already working full-time at his new computer company NeXT in anticipation of mass Internet development.
While a small portion of Kringle's interview was used in the Nerds, he says the originals of the interview were lost during transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that a complete VHS copy was found in the director’s garage.
This filmed material, slightly edited, became the basis for the 68-minute Steve Jobs film: The Lost Interview, which comes out at Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of detailed interviews, Jobs here seems unusually prepared to lay out his technological philosophy and business strategy.
And incredibly thoughtful.
At four different points during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers—reflections of 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more accurately.
There are also moments where Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by Kringle’s questions, forcing him to move faster on to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In a pre-Pixar, iPod and iPhone Lost interview, there’s something ominously prophetic when Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong and offers his own vision for the future of information technology.
It’s one thing to read about posthumous appraisals of Jobs’ work, but there’s something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs that we see here, an alarming dreamer on the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Shortly after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time in business, I kept asking, 'Why are you doing this?' And the answers you always get are, 'Oh, that's just how it's done.'
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks very deeply in business.
Here's what I learned.
Jobs continues to describe in detail his attempts to rationalize reporting in Apple.
Disturbed by the way in which expenses were recorded, often beginning with “standard expenses” that were taken from the ceiling and then adapted using “clarification”, he created an automated structure that ensured that they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
The Joke on the Pope:
Jobs details the “blue box” he crafted with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device before, but the euphoria of Jobs here when describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using a phone-automatic, ordering a conversation and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
“We covered the globe half a dozen times, and you were yelling at the phone machine, and it penetrated a minute later into the neighboring phone machine,” Jobs says with a smile.
“We were young, and all we learned was that we could engineer something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us knew a little bit, but we could have mastered a little thing that could control a big thing — it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple could ever have appeared without it.
Jobs continues to describe in detail one famous ploy he and Wozniak practically coped with by calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking the Pope to his phone, struggling to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with an American diplomat, the two burst into laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and Bill Hewlett's cold nickname):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to assemble the frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett Packard.
“It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP’s employees visiting the company’s research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw “the very first desktop computer.”
It was the size of a suitcase, it had a small monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to go to HP as a teenager and go around that car and write programs for it.
About Improvised Innovation:
In several interviews, Jobs talks about the invention of new products on the fly.
At the dawn of his career, when he went to sell a handful of boards, one buyer asked him to assemble a whole computer.
Working only 30 days on credit, he had to think through the assembly and delivery of ready-made devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember the furious controversies ... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to collect a mouse that would cost $300], and I was fed up, and I went out, and I found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we were able to collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
For companies that are losing energy:
Long before he led Apple’s renaissance, Jobs accurately predicted how many industry leaders would err in their vision of the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the types of people] who eventually come to the management of companies, and the people who make the product are supplanted from the platform of decision makers.
The product genius that led to this monopolistic position is being supplanted by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products—required skill.
This is what happened to Xerox.
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
It could have been ten times bigger, it could have been Microsoft in the '90s.
They were defeated by victory.
Innovation as an art form:
“A great idea is separated from a great product by a great amount of skillful work... when you unleash a great idea, it changes and grows.”
You will learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are trade-offs you need to make – some things you can’t force to make electrons, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head — these concepts — by bringing them all together.
Ultimately, it all boils down to taste – it all boils down to trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and later – trying to bring it into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We have always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to become the best specialists in the field of information technology in the world.
If it weren’t for information technology, they would have done amazing things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with opponents of the health care law while the court considers the case
The day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically contentious issue of whether he would listen to President Obama’s dismissal of the health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were celebrating a dinner sponsored by a law firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions submitted for consideration.
One of the issues on the agenda was a motion backed by 26 states challenging a sweeping review of health care passed by Congress last year, a law that brought together conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the trial; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour turnaround debate is expected in March 2012 and the outcome is likely to be an impediment to the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court ruling is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and argue that the health care law should be repealed will most likely be Paul Clement, who was deputy attorney general during the presidency of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual lunch of the Society of Federalists, a long-established group constantly advocating conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
Lunch was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the court hearing.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the health care law.
Honored guests for lunch? Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been attending the events of the Federalist Society for many years.
This is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they obeyed, they might fall under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: “A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, honorary guest, or be mentioned in the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia and Thomas’ apparent closeness to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the government.
“This staggering breach of ethics and indifference to the code runs counter to some judges’ claims that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the General Court.
“The judges drank and ate dinner at an official fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now being tried in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in raising money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas hardly pay attention to critics who say that they are very willing to mix court cases with the involved groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
What’s more, conservatives argue that it’s an ethical question for Judge Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the level of the First Instance Court.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to hear the case because she was too involved in protecting the law then to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives record-breaking $18 billion order for planes
Emirates is ordering 50 wide-body Boeing 777s and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is more than $1 billion.
It is hardly news that the company receives an order for 50 units of its products.
But this is an important event when this company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co., and the price tag for all these 50 aircraft is $ 18 billion.
Just as important is where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, the growing gold rush of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast published Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing has announced this weekend its largest order in dollar terms for commercial aircraft - 50 two-pass Boeing 777 aircraft.
An incredible order came from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft that will raise the total price tag to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts significantly better fuel economy and passenger comfort.
The price for six aircraft will be more than 1 billion dollars.
"This is really very good for Boeing," Morningstar analyst Neil Dior said.
“The quality of these particular buyers is quite high.”
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they not only have the money to pay for the planes, but also the rising fuel prices, which are usually detrimental to airlines, as this is one of their biggest spending items, are not so damaging because the country is making money at high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel aircraft orders when prices rise, Diora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
Emirates’ order strengthens Boeing’s leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to encroach on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing’s victory at the air show came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of the largest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
He postponed the debut to increase the axial load after buyers demanded to increase the payload and flight range.
Boeing Co shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister loses election in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n
Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n claims that the drug traffickers helped opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s sister did not appear to have fulfilled her bid for the governorship of Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n during the fierce state elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers had helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the post of governor of the Western state is called Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
“The interference of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole country,” Luisa Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n said in a radio interview the day after Sunday’s vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the elections ... they grabbed ballot boxes, put obstacles ... and made people vote" for the IRP.
The IRP ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
She is preparing to return, and the victory in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this attempt.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems only slightly ahead of Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who led the ratings until election day.
Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the HDP, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or the DRP, which now owns the governor’s chair, came in third – a serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Morelia, denied links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to acknowledge the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
This is the home state of President Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and he chose Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence still continues.
The mayor of the HDP was killed a week before the election when he campaigned for Louise Maria Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, no matter how terrible the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n may look, victory will give the party a driving force.
The man to represent the IRP in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: “I think this victory should be very inspiring in the run-up to next year.”
ADB urges Asia to help save eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has ordered India and China to be prepared to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that will halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of ADB’s Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should “do everything they can” to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries are looking at Europe’s difficulties “unbiasedly,” and said Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term recession in the global economy.
“It concerns all of us.”
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
“Asia may be protected to some extent, but it cannot be invulnerable.”
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been badly undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowings have grown threateningly, and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s looming debt crisis has raised fears that it could lead the global economy back into recession, and has led to calls from leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Nagh predicted that any Asian aid would be made through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of EU financial aid bonds, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provided great bargaining power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said “India will do everything it can” to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a decline in exports and a reduction in foreign capital injections.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and uneasy,” he said.
“We have huge challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not an option, it’s a prerequisite, because where we find jobs for tens of millions of our boys and girls.”
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide assistance to Europe for Indian 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
“At some point, they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and going on holidays to the seaside, and it will not be taken well,” he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep Greece’s numerous and well-paid public sector workers at work in poorly organized, unprofitable enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Nagh said the eurozone crisis was threatening "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
ADB’s forecast for 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 now faces “lower risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to make “emergency plans” to protect themselves from the recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of potential cuts in defense spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday warned that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to the $450 billion cut in the coming decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more could be unavoidable if Congress fails to come to an agreement on spending.
“The consequences of these cuts will be devastating for the Department,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Republican Lindsay Graham, South Carolina.
He said that Congress’ failure to pass the budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration would initiate a general cut of 23 percent and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a strong reduction, applied so thoughtlessly, will make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects impossible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and will seriously damage other attempts at modernization," Panetta wrote.
“We will also have to force many of our civilian workers to be laid off, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off the civilian ones to achieve the goal.”
“These changes will undermine the confidence of those who support our army and cause serious damage to combat readiness.”
The cuts will eventually affect military units, Panetta said.
“Although military funding in overseas emergency operations is not directly affected by the sequestration, military advances will be severely affected by a major disruption in core budgets,” Panetta said.
“Contract staff will be reduced, which will result in the cancellation of contracts and a surveillance contract that is supported by the troops.”
Staff will be cut, leading to delays in payments to military contractors, and legal and political support will be disrupted.
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
“The sequester in the Department of Defense will result in the rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
“We stand firm against these draconian actions,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday evening as they released Panetta’s letter.
“It’s not an exit we can live with, and it’s not an exit we should impose on ourselves.”
“The Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter or the senators’ recent warnings will lead to a budget compromise or strengthen calls to free the Pentagon from cuts, we’ll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the possible cuts, although he came to work in the Pentagon leadership after years of budgeting expertise in Congress and the White House and realizing that he faced a difficult choice.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister drew a depressing picture of what might follow — troops with a shell but no nucleus.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a squad without bullets."
"It's the wing of an airplane without enough trained pilots."
“It’s a paper tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without sufficiently trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission,” Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
“It is a force that suffers from an unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and is unable to fight potential enemies.”
“In fact, it encourages aggression.”
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlined new details of how the cuts “bring significant operational risks: slow down the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be first in deployment and in response everywhere in the world; and lead to unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already passed the tests, and some only in the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single F35 strike fighter, a planned new bomber, a new generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marines need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion in 10 years, but its proponents say it is a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to catch a lie
A quick look at the latest headlines shows how serious and ubiquitous lies and deception are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is engaged in challenging allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury because they allegedly concealed the fact that a retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught saying to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his pranks, which was quickly refuted by indisputable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with financial fraud during a campaign to cover up extramarital ties.
And again, none of those who lived at the time will ever forget a media circus with President Bill Clinton caught lying about their sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on exams at school and college are commonplace.
There have been cases where teachers have given students answers to tests in order to have a good assessment of the results of their activities.
Teachers who have to teach the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
Within a day, research shows, you can be lied to 10 to 200 times.
Now it is assumed that a significant part of this is a lie in salvation.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of getting to know each other.
Identifying a lie or accusing a lie is a necessary skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game similar to, say, a charade where you need to shout “Catched!”, the detection of lies is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths about lies have been debunked.
Liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always get stuck, stutter, blush, or fuss.
It is not necessary to conclude from this that liars are difficult to notice and difficult to expose.
An experienced whistleblower can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, question structure, and temporal characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of lying knowledge, and it's clear that identifying lies is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps navigate our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel relaxed, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from the study that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, while women lie more about others, usually to protect someone’s feelings that married people lie less to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are most often brazen).
We also know that if you are perceived as a fraud, others will feel less guilty about cheating you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
This is called the "determination of the initial state".
This helps to provide a starting point for assessing the changes further.
Watch the pose, laughter, voice characteristics of your object.
It would be good for you to know if a person is constantly knocking with his feet in a normal state, then you will not bring unfair charges when you see the knocking with his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Deceivers can fix the upper part of their body when they try to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean towards the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or demonstrate “relief after an interview”—this exaggerated sigh of relief and change of posture when all the difficult questions are behind.
Investigators often falsify the end-of-interrogation signal to simply look at this relief after the interview.
So, pay attention to the speech of your object.
Scott Peterson is known to have stumbled and exploited the past, claiming that his murdered wife was alive, leading to her searching across the country.
Distancing people can also use distancing in speech: “I didn’t have a sexual relationship with this woman...Miss Lewinsky” or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely detectable.
Someone may use "qualifying language" when answering a difficult question: "Well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... as far as I know."
This makes the answer more emotional than factual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to detect lies, but you can master the skill of detecting deception.
These skills will increase everyone’s chances of not becoming a victim of skilled scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be revised after the threat of the United States to postpone its approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of the planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions but reassuring environmentalists -- the company that is about to build the pipeline says it will gladly revise the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that it would remove the planned pipeline from the environmentally sensitive area of the Sand Hills in Nebraska and is confident that the project will still receive approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of the state of Nebraska.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would postpone the decision on the project at the federal level until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska Sand Hills area and the Ogalala aquifer, a huge underground water reserve.
“This is a real step forward,” Congressman Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to push the decision back to 2013, after next year’s elections, although authorities have denied that policy was involved in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama called the decision an appeal from the State Department and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline should stretch from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It has to ship 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by trade unions, which hope for about 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to expedite the move from the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study showed that the project would have only a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source in the energy industry stated that the Department's auditor had ordered a separate review of the review procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
Another was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to conduct the initial study was inappropriate, as it was associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBell was sued for allegedly causing the child nausea from fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBell began to riot in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their teenage daughter to such an extent that she was sick of fear.
“Lady Marmalade’s tirade has scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she has endured “personality change, sleep disorder” and “strong fear of strangers,” her family says at Manhattan’s Supreme Court.
It happened on November 10 last year, when the scene worker Kevin Monk, his wife, kindergarten teacher Rosanna, and Genevieve were going on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and lowered her daughter to the floor for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter's doing?' I said yes and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBelle made an angry rebuke to a pregnant woman.
“She said aggressively, ‘You shouldn’t have left your daughter at the door,’” Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She became furious and began to use the curses -- the word for C and the word for F -- in the raised tones.
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the child's mother.
LaBelle attacked her mother -- who was still holding Genevieve -- and her escorts had to hold her and push her into the waiting car, Rosanna Monk said.
The baby cried so much that she was sick, she added.
The family later sent LaBelle an apology note, but received no response.
LaBell's lawyer and representatives are not answering calls for comment.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took up the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity to children with cancer.
“The goal is to make Patty LaBell responsible for his actions,” Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially in relation to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child in his arms."
Climate problems have slowed the economy.
During the first year of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez’s rule, unemployment and the illegal labor market rose in Sinaloa, foreign financing declined, and the economy weakened.
2011 is a year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as related to the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdez, also called the Year of Change, which generated great hopes for economic development, but given the adverse climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, there was no growth, but there was a decrease in the main indicators of economic development.
The low February temperatures not only led to losses of millions for the agricultural sector, but they also limited the growth opportunities of the state economy, causing a 3.6 per cent decline in economic activity in the first half of the year, largely due to a historic drop of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on frost-affected areas provided by Mexico ' s Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 per cent were wholly affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected, with vegetables, maize and chickpeas being the main crops affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, which is more than 18.9 percent of the population, followed by more than 18.9 percent of the population, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and in July.
Decreased liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is discussed by many factors, for economist Gerardo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions that were taken in public policy.
“What we are seeing now is an increase in unemployment that is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market to limit resources imposed by the law that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use in something,” he said.
The Stopped Immigration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the growth of unemployment.
“The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been limited, primarily because of difficulties with entry, and in the second - because, once they have entered, they are already faced with very many difficulties in finding a job, so a group of people remain and demand jobs here in the state, as a result, the unemployment rate increases,” he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa’s labor market analysis is getting worse when you look at the large number of violations that predominate in working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the state’s active population is working without being mentioned as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and irregularities in registration, another reminder of work in the state is represented by low wages; the state has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records by the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was before September 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction in FDI
In addition to a decline in economic activity and a high rate of unemployment, the 2011 FDI recorded the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, from January to July the FDI of the state amounted to $630.697. which shows a fall of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the state government’s Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mainly went to service companies.
Debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government asked for approval in July during the state congress for a loan of 3 billion pesos, which would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2,600 million pesos were approved locally, and no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the government of Mario L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of the Manufacturing Industry, said that during 2011 there was a lack of agreement on the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
“The economic performance in Sinaloa this year has been really low, there is a lot of work to do to regain the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better,” he said.
Deceleration of the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as the early frosts this year halted the state’s economy and its efficiency and growth were limited.
“Low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not become fast enough to create economic dynamics that allows us to have an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and, therefore, at the end of the year, we close it below our expectations,” he said.
Revision of direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said the state needed to continue its most dynamic production activity.
“Overall, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has,” he said.
Upcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of determining the future direction in order to better guide the government’s efforts.
"Overall, I would say that the government is trying to be successful in various areas, there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its own manner of conducting public policy.
“There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is aware that there is still a lot to be done,” he said.
He is sentenced for 8 kilograms of marijuana.
Five years in prison and a 100-day income penalty, a sentence imposed on a Navolato citizen for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General's Office reported that the convicted drug trafficker, Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, was convicted of an offence against health, in this case possession of marijuana for the purpose of distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 while patrolling Cypriano Valdez Street in front of Post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trafficker was driving a white car pickup truck, in which he was carrying a black bag in a car drawer, and in the passenger seat a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seizure was transferred to the Second District Court and the accused continues to be imprisoned at the Crime Legal Consequences Support Centre.
Contributions to work must be made
Public works related to such programs as Homeland, Saving Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants run the risk of remaining unfinished or long-delayed due to lack of funds, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that while work programmes had so far evolved, they were at risk, as the state government was unable to make appropriate contributions, which amounted to more than 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding for all three programmes was approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state had to contribute 25 per cent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality had provided the resources for the work, so it is still possible to delay their completion.
“They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is over, they didn’t give us a penny, when from the beginning of July they had to give us a part,” he said, “so as not to delay, we started work and they made a lot of progress, but we need money.”
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions that he had to make, so that at the beginning of the term of the municipality had to borrow money to cover more than 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the administration of the state.
“It happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial opportunities to participate, and the programs continued to develop, and this year, in order to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state should have,” he explained.
Although the state authorities had an obligation to deliver those resources, he said that a request had been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarrealu, to increase efforts so that interest related to them would arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they didn’t give us a penny.”
The court will approve the “transition to digital television” in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court has rejected constitutional claims put forward by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which transfers the so-called “transition to digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as eight votes were not collected to invalidate it.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, felt that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n had not exceeded his authority by issuing a decree detailing actions to move to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected due to the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to express its opinion on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television program is a right enshrined in law by the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
According to this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the ministerial meeting, it was also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot determine by general rules the measures for which the state administration should prepare.
“I also don’t think that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body,” and recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive branch, which has a constitutional mandate, government.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years, leading to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of transformation into a digital form that includes meeting societal needs, which has more than just a technical dimension, "because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues."
These issues, he said, "require the work of the entire system, formed on the principle of state economic management, includes a group of authorities, which the Constitution combines into a state executive power."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and did so with the help of the executive, despite the presence of highly specialized technical institutions.
It cannot be inferred from this that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures that the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly are enforced in the administrative sphere, he said.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n analyzes the possibility of counting "voice-by-voice"
The difference between first and second place in the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, accounting for 879 of the total of 6,074 protocols.
Vote-for-vote counts are real in the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n election process this year, where, according to data obtained from the Pre-Election Results Programme (PRP), the difference between first and second places in the governor's elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes, accounting for 879 out of a total of 6,074 protocols.
In light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of the Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Electoral Institute (IMI), Maria de Los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the Electoral Corps approved a set of principles to align local rules with federal electoral reform.
As it should be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Electoral Law, as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the timeframe specified in the law in the State's Official Gazette, stating that he had some
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJJ) ruled on a constitutional claim put forward by the local legislature and called the state representative’s vote on constitutional reform “valid and illegal” because it had no right to “permit or support them”.
In an interview about the possibility of “vote for vote”, Maria de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council, the IVM would be able to submit a partial or complete counting of votes by the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recalculation of one or more ballot boxes may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not coincide; there is no voting and counting protocol in the ballot box or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate-winner of the election in question and the one who received the second place in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that put forward the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
A general recount shall also be made if, at the end of the normal recount, it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate in second place is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from a political party whose candidate has taken second place, in the event that ballot boxes that have been taken into account in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that in such a situation there are elections in Morelia, where, according to PPRV, the difference between the first and second places is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will.
His ashes will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown on Sunday evening; a survey and a resting mass were held on Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was to have his ashes scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama.
After accepting condolences along with other people who died in the crash, the family of Basio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel located on the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he passed a survey of the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member while in high school.
“His wish was to return to Saltillo, and for his ashes to be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinama, he always told his family and friends,” said Sandra Cortés Basio, sister of the pilot.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother, devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortés Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the College of Aviation in Sapopan, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him, they said that his head was dizzy even in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him as when he brought Martha Saagun to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for the graduation ceremony of his relative, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in his life: flying.
He is sent to the last way.
Gunshots fired in honor of his Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortés Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Technological High School in Saltillo, which
Basio Cortés was recently killed when the helicopter he was flying crashed, along with the Provincial Government Secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all members of that ministry.
At 18:05, the remains of Basio Cortés (cremated), a resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the Funeral Bureau to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martinez, at the esplanade of a training school where his family was already waiting for him, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives.
Three bodies found abandoned at Kadereit's NL farm
A few hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed in the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot on an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo Leon.
The find was found at 1.5 km of the Cadereita Highway in the direction of Santiago, on a hill in a commune known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by noticed that in the village house, the wall of which is painted in beige and brown, the gates were open.
Looking inside, literally three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, they immediately let the relevant authorities know.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in a white T-shirt.
Almost one meter was the body of another person, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were face down.
According to the evidence gathered there, three people were killed elsewhere, as there were no shell casings on the site.
On the fence of the village house there are signs addressed by one organized criminal group to another, also in it and in the gate there are several holes from bullets.
11 Caught in Cadreyte
The Ministry of National Security presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereita, and who are accused of kidnappings, murders, “fraud” and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the colony of Los Alvero, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel patrolled the village of Stare Rancho in Kadereite, when they saw a car without license plates with two men in the cabin.
Stopping them and conducting an inspection, the military found a rifle, ammunition and 18 rounds.
Later, after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of their accomplices was stopped on the public land of La Pravda, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of General Teran, Hina and Kadereita.
A new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy’s appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with Italy’s president on Wednesday to present a new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm he could form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take its positions.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
“I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country’s ability to get out of this difficult period,” he told reporters.
Monty did not say explicitly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
“The structure is well defined now,” he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from Monti to hurry up, volatile markets set Italy’s BTP bond income by more than 7 percent for 10 years, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marchegalia, the leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we will actively support this government.”
We believe that this government is Italy’s last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti’s chances of success were largely based on LDP support for Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday because of the crisis.
“We believe that Professor Monti’s efforts should lead to a good outcome,” Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, matters because so far many of its members have opposed the government’s technocrat majority that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government should have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blocking or halting of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He'll end his line of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief pause at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would step down, Italy’s debt value has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Saving Italy with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 billion in public debt would be too much for the eurozone’s modern financial defenders.
Monti said his government would exist until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that politicians would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist that it should be composed only of technical specialists, evidence of their dissatisfaction with the fact that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual distrust and dissent of the parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
Spaniards have more gaming experience than Tikos
Of the 22 players declared in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players claimed played 50 matches.
A slight contrast with Costa Rica, when compared to 22 players summoned by both countries to a friendly match today at 3:05 a.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA rankings, have a whole list of A-Class qualifiers, Tricolor has only Michael Uman’s defender as the only one to have played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez Stadium.
The Spanish players, who play in the All-Star League and in the strong clubs of the English Premier League, have been very active in the league and in local cup competitions this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
To this, it is worth adding the experience of the Spanish Fury in a difficult qualification in the Euro or the World Cup.
Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the list is headed by the Spanish national team goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (match, lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against Tricolore and set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
Javi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, a Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Javi were named the best last week by UEFA along with another player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and goalkeeper Schalke Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez with 102.
Almost approaching the hundredth Carles Puyol with 97 games.
Javi Alonso followed with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From Costa Rica next to Michael Umana, left side Junior Diaz with 48 matches and scorer Brian Ruiz with 45.
Next, only five have crossed the line in 30 games: Keylor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36, and José Luis Lopez with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain with Gerard Piquet (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santiago Santiago Casorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbelloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiola (31).
The national team with less than 30 appearances on the field has Roy Miller with 26 matches, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The others didn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moral has only four games, and Hordy Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet made their debut.
Spain's leading player David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the one who brought more points, twice as much as Carlos Hernandez and three times as much as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet included the country in the tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of his career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
There have been more than 20 years of waiting, but the group says it’s also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
This was the statement of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the territory of South America as part of a tour in honor of the twentieth anniversary of work and on Sunday, the 20th, will make its only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m., together with the Los Angeles team The X and the local group Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
For your fans from Costa Rica, this is a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica? Do you know what your fans are experiencing?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far everything is going well.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once – on vacation, it’s a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
We are very happy to bring our music there.
I ask about it because there is some devotion to the band; fans live in tension in the days before the concert.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, treat it as the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played in the past 21 years have been over the past two weeks.
We had some great shows in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo and we hope it put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves here are incredible.
My friends always go surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua as well as Mexico, these are great places to surf, that’s how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say that you have made a grandiose show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we’ve never played there before, we have no limits on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible with a variety of songs; we will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a great variety of repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that work?
I think that’s partly because we have nine records and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven’t played for a while, it keeps us in tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it makes it more interesting for people.
This tour marks 20 years of career.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yes, absolutely.
First, I don’t think any of us could ever have imagined that we would be in a rock band and that we’ve been doing this for more than 20 years makes it a dream.
We are very happy with our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we all love making music.
We are happy to travel to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Everything is going very well for us.
What does it mean for you to be a significant part of the flowering grunge?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We are good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that’s unusual.
From time to time, one group from the same city appears, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups appear at the same time in the same city.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
“Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we’re happy to be friends with all of them and it’s an honor for us to be part of the sound of Seattle that came out.
It is also very strange that a group like yours stays together and in the same composition for so long.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many bands exist.
First, I think we’re lucky we’re still alive, and second, we care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, musical paths have also been opened, which give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other’s music, and it couldn’t have been better.
Your attitude to the word fame was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do whatever you wanted.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier to find balance.
We take care not to be too long on tour because it’s easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what made it, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we write really good songs and at first it was great.
We have been a band for almost three years and have not released a single album, until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were a lot of disappointments because it lasted so long, and the most important thing is that we are still close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore) who started with us in the group, and when I hear a lot of song or see a photo, I think about the incredible man who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work.
He was a wonderful man and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to be discovered?
Yes, the producers have sent us some video offerings, and it was the band that we liked the most, so we’re looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas has to offer live, and it has to be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing words in Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind, Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski ...
There are so many of them that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the relevance of grunge despite the fact that it is no longer in vogue?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone that came along at the same time, and if that’s important now, I think it’s great because it’s music worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney make music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, but now it has become more positive.
How do you explain this change?
This is interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that may seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very gloomy, although they may sound a bit positive.
From both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you grow up and you’ve had some kind of trauma in your life and you’ve lost a family member or friend, these events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a state hospital for examination for loss of muscle strength seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including cancer of the tongue, for which he was operated on four times and is under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fujimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of strength in his lower extremities.
Aginaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori should be a candidate for the benefit of pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew he was innocent.
He underwent four operations for tongue cancer, lost 18 kilograms, to which other diseases, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure and problems with blood circulation in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007, with the Police National Directorate of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the forces of the army destruction detachment, which operated in secret during the early years of his rule.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and businessmen will arrive in Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and start talks on the region’s political problems.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, the most important point of an extensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to a schedule published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "favorable for the exchange of information on the issue of political relations between the two nations," the South American country's leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n’s support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country in the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that sparked Uruguay's protest and recall for consultations of his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group formed from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, an agreement with the South American country since January this year on exchanging tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Government of Uruguay has tried in recent years to expedite the conclusion of tax-exchange agreements to leave the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “gray list” of countries that do not use international tax cooperation standards.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a free trade agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The usaty plumber will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil paws of Bowser, but he has never done so in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he will fight for the love of a girl in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will appear in stores around the world this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
“Mario is a hero who has to tell us how stereoscopy without glasses will work,” said Omar Alvarez, head of Nintendo’s press service in Spain, during a presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first Nintendo video game specifically designed for this platform" because hitherto successful products like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing games.
Nintendo said that despite its existence in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and mobile game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once started, most experts will go "in the second round" to the levels of the game, which this time more difficult.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that affects only the depth of action, but on which you need to play in three dimensions to overcome a variety of obstacles and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also marks the hero's return to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winks to fans of the series and repeats the successful formula from previous games, a plumber with a mustache must walk through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, scenery, costumes and enemies, as well as "player" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom said Tuesday that Alfonso Portillo’s extradition process had begun to hold him accountable in the United States for a $70 million laundering plot.
Thus ends the process by which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which demanded the extradition of Portillo to try him there.
At a press conference, Colom said his decision was related to the independence of the judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of first instance has already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his mandate, he did not "handle" legal decisions and took all extradition procedures he had ever known about.
Along with Portillo, Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and serious bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Kolom has done shows the enforcement process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted to prosecute the former head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CJ), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found innocent of embezzling Q120 million at the Department of Defense during the presidential term, a process that preceded extradition, but the Department of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of social support organization Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people exposed to social exclusion helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the ceremony held in the premises of the old factory Fabra I Coats, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove was born next to Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or who are vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday’s celebration at Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association in these 25 years.
The different political views during the elections showed the uniform nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the Chairman of the Generalitat, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor, Hordy Puhol, the ceremony was attended by former Socialist Education consultant, Ernest Maragall, and ex-Lieutenant Mayor and current Ecosocialist, member of the municipal council, Ricardo Goma.
Also appeared in Fabra I Coats current consultant on social welfare and family, Josep Lewis Claris and CEO on social work La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far is “a good base”.
The Chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting bad circumstances and giving hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not new to the organization and the work done to it,” he said.
The captured building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 occupiers left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare experienced by neighbors living in house 51 on Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they illegally occupied yesterday afternoon, where they organized mass parties that irritated neighbors, by a court decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a transit control," the manager said.
The squatters, who took 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest are inhabited, took all the electricity and part of the water, painted the walls and left traces of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were a platform for mass parties that lasted up to two days and annoyed the owners.
Behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says the invaders of the building drew her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10 euros.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the visitors of the club, but by the residents of the squat and, above all, by those who attended the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and it has been nine months since he "forgives" her rent payment.
The city police also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, adviser Alberto Fernand D<0xC3><0xAD>az, last week demanded “immediately evacuate the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have emerged from neighbors and degradation in this area.”
The popular leader explained that until the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and almost every room and that some of them have been hacked.
In this sense, he added, “it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to stand firm against the immorality that is taking place in the building.”
So, yesterday, the police evacuated the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police drove to 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
A park or a forest?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after disputes about contributions
The municipal competition for 16 doors resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, on the rise of the now-extinct Barcelona Capital Corporation (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserola.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of SKB, in 1987 the park again took a place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is oriented not to the north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Kolserola as a natural park contradicts this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild boar as a Yogi bear.
That was until, in September, the council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for many other gates in Colserola.
Under the gate is understood the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that, or someone wants to put a gate on the field.
The question is one: Colserola? Park or mountain?
Competitions, and their organizational side, and their impact on the city, are a topic of discussion for all Barcelona architects.
This is almost the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this clan of chosen people recognize each other in the elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who attended say.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldan, after reaching the coastline, it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildefon Serda, a mountain with green apples, was not implemented.
“We must admit that the biggest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, thanks to its excellent availability.
Colserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title of the "Colserola Gate" contains a "word trap": we should not think of them "as entering the park, but as limiting some areas where we have to act."
Modolo, like Roldan and Bayona with experience in urban construction, called the proposal an “intellectual task” with “some dangers.”
Risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the 80's experience, which ended at the Forum site "with its swan song".
The first fear is actually limiting the boundaries where you can build.
“The limitation of something is the preparation of the next step” means the transition.
“We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [with regard to the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real trouble.”
More to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work done outside of Calcerola, which "is not to be missed", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the mayor's office offers his profession to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter the debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should lead interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues), which should have created: "Architects should only be a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that asks the name of this part is complex, because the rules of the competition lack a general view of Colserola: "There have been announced 16 intersecting competitions, - he says, - in the sense of a sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires, at least in his case, to decide to participate in 16 competitions.
On the other hand, a project for a single gate can intersect according to the program and definition with an architect's project for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council has to ensure that the strip directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide in its fullness an area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrasabal and he will be released
After 72 days of settlement, Red Casino’s attorney pardoned Mayor Monterrey’s brother in a lawsuit against him on extortion charges.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after a legal representative of Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is pursuing extortion proceedings against Mayor Monterrey’s brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, published a series of photos and videos where Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic contribution to the Monterrey authorities to allow a secret operation in the gambling house.
After a public conviction, the Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on 2 September he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of an agent of the State Ministry of Inheritance Crimes, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed at this location for 49 days, following the second travel ban order, after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Kadereita allegedly for extortion of half a million pesos from the owner of Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with an average degree of isolation of prisoners because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue his time at the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza.
On October 25, the arrest order was issued by the secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Yanez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, evidence of Jonas's guilt, such as charging 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for permission to operate, was clear enough.
On Monday, Red Casino’s legal representative, Victor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for a pardon for the region’s mayor’s brother, so that in the following hours he could be freed.
During the trial, the public prosecutor in court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether he had reimbursed the damage and which of the gambling house's partners would grant pardon, although the lawyer tried not to give his name.
Based on record 197/2011, Jonas Larrasabal was granted legal pardon, and no statement can be made about the trial planned against him thereafter, nor will any compensation or punishment be required.
After the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50, it was ordered to immediately release Larrasabal Breton.
The court clerk, Jorge Janez, went to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolas in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also notify him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hacome talks about the details of the disaster, which killed the Minister of Internal Affairs, Francisco Blake, and seven other people.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) reported that the results obtained in the accident, in which the Minister of Internal Affairs Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people were killed, showed that the helicopter struck directly on the ground in a state of complete integrity, without attempts by the pilot to make an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hacome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft went up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flight.
"Elements that appear to indicate that the vessel had several contacts with the ground, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters, where the vehicle lost its flushing."
He also reported that the ship was intended for 19 people, respectively, it complied with the necessary requirements for the transportation of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the impact area did not report the presence of parts on the ground.
“The study reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
“The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfies the relevant requirements of passenger transportation.
The earth in this place has a gradient of seven to 30 degrees.
By this point, the secretary said, the main thing is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, CEO of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that during the strike, the presidential helicopter was operated at cruising speed and that it happened on soft rising soil.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a normal flight manoeuvre at the time of impact," he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Pérez Hacome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the rules of aviation, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which means that the team must have visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports revealed suitable conditions for take-off when the aircraft headed for the border area between the city of Mexico City and the state of Mexico, where cloud layers were observed at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is possible that because of the cloudy conditions, the team was looking for a zone of less height and greater visibility in the Kuernavaka Valley.
Place of impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording from the aircraft radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change of direction of flight.
Scattering of debris on a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact occurred on the front and side lines.
The scattering of the debris makes it clear that the helicopter collided with the ground in conditions of structural integrity.
There were no obvious signs of fire or explosion:
In the disaster zone, there is undiscovered evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent studies suggest that there may have been multiple contact with the ground.
During work on the spot, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the ground has a gradient of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The pictures show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After careful research in a larger area than the designated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS Announces Obesity Gene Search Program
Social Protection Leads Study to Find Obesity Gene in Children and Young People, Supported by IPN Experts
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that it is conducting a study to detect the obesity gene in children and young people, called the “Genetics of Obesity in Childhood and Adolescents” protocol, which will provide a count of signs associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Biochemistry Research Unit of the National Medical Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students of the National Institute of Health of the Nation (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
In the study, the population (whether prescribed or not) is invited to participate by going to the MSSI sports centers participating in the study, to the Valley of Mexico City, where tests will be conducted with children each Saturday, at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began to be conducted at the sports center in Cuautemoque (in the west of Mexico state), and from October 8, the events are held at the sports center in Nessaualcoyotl (east of Mexico state).
Once the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children has been achieved, the study will continue at the Independence Sports Center (South of Mexico City) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (North of Mexico City).
He explained that the purpose of this study is to understand the components and importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and young Mexicans to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14 and the main goal is to gather 3,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 6 and 14 with their parents’ permission and under their supervision to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist circumference), blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity) will be carried out.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said the study reflects the concerns of health professionals about worrying weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that in just 6 years there was an increase: in the case of boys, 77 percent were obese, in the case of girls, 47 percent; in the case of overweight, there was also a significant increase," said the expert of MSSI.
He said that the validity of the search for markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican is 65 percent descendant of American Indians, 30 percent descendant of Europeans, and five percent descendant of Africans, and this condition affected genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that basically the consequence of obesity genetics is the body’s inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and it is stored as fat.
The researcher explained that the immediate benefit for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children, which can reveal whether they have at least some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck (acutes) and forearms means the likelihood of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with complete confidentiality, doctors hand it over in writing to parents, to whom they explain all the measurements and lifestyle changes that need to be taken to avoid the disease.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main reasons provoking overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV and using transport over short distances instead of walking.
This is also due to the high calorie intake, that is, the increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamala, bread, pizza, burgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetic predisposition analyzed in this program.
Asphalt UNAM can avoid cracks
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a blend of the best quality, resistant to environmental and temperature influences.
If the signals sent by the road surface were given attention, it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand pits for each rainy season in the metropolitan area in the Valley of Mexico City, says Rafael Herrera Nahera, a researcher at the UNAM School of Chemistry, and adds that if the process of construction and maintenance of the paved road surface is correct, then the number of pits can be reduced.
In his lecture Technological View of Pits, read as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture with characteristics close to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore counteract pit formation.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are of high molecular weight, called asphalts, and others of low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of bitumen lies in the fact that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 its viscosity is very high, and at 50 degrees Celsius it retains an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures bitumen becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes throughout the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in the field of chemical engineering.
The chemtrail scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the top layers is bitumen, composed of small stones, lowered into bitumen and then compressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is immersed in bitumen.
When driving vehicles and exerting effort, it helps the forces to distribute very well on the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt coating, he added, placed the last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, in fact sand also immersed in asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will come into contact with the wheels of transport, it should have more resistance than asphalt coating and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute these efforts, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the state of asphalt.
When the earth is raw, the water penetrates the coating and it is difficult to get out of it, this causes the softening of all layers of the coating and, therefore, the formation of pits.
In the formation of pits, he said, a layer of wear is worn first and only then it affects the bitumen, but the damage does not occur instantly, a process that should be paid attention at the first signs of the current repair programs.
Also, a member of the National System of Researchers explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer of coating should always be associated with the transport load and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met to prevent the frequent occurrence of pits.
Rafael Herrera said that there is still much to be studied and done about bitumen, for example, bitumen emulsions, which are already on the market in other countries and even help to repair pits with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What wasn't enough for a Valliere candidate to become the new Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Cerna Melina Ramirez from receiving the crown of Miss Colombia.
Vallee has been crowned Princess for 14 times.
Once again, Valle del Cauca has only to wish to get the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Cerna had to be content to be on the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new Princess of Colombia.
Taking into account the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and the sceptre (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19) (19), Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19) (19) and Garr<0xC3><0xAD>a (19).
The question that many people are asking now:
What was missing? Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, who in each of the performances demonstrated that she had everything to become the new Miss Colombia, not just so she was elected the Queen of Police and the most beautiful person according to Vogue - titles that were held by Queens, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who received the crowns.
The first factor that played a role in the jury’s decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question “What book characterizes you and why?”, asked by Martin Murilla Gomez of the Literary Society Let’s Read.
She replied to the questioner:
“I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it’s a form of culture, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood – The Little Prince – is a pretty deep book.
Today I read Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read; and at the moment I read a book by Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Heat of Blood.
The answer, which the jury did not like because of the term "cultivation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the books quoted characterizes it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and satisfied with her result: "The universe is wise, what is going to happen is happening."
And all of you, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the hypotheses voiced – Vallier burned from favoritism.
A reporter from Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> suggested that, because she was preferred, she was greeted with an ovation, and she was the candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Austera's culinary competition, audience voting for the best national costume, and Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, provoked the stress of the Queen, and as a consequence she was not shiny on the scene".
And this was noted during her first appearance in a swimsuit at Hilton Beach and during her two shows at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy demonstrated by the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "How Home" program, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that a candidate who wins more awards during the contest doesn't become a queen."
In addition, the representative of Vallier recently avoided communication with the press, and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vallier failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That’s why two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doti said they were looking for a woman committed to their country’s social needs.
“Beauty alone is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only at appearance, but also focus on public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they should already be involved in projects,” she said.
There is also a suggestion that the representative of Valliere sinned with defects on her buttocks and fibrosis, which was seen on her stomach, but this is controversial, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens consultant Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orosco notes that Melina did not have the best body that she had, and better, "but the problems of fibrosis on the abdomen, which were not very noticeable to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Ojos of the magazine Kromos believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauca was that she underwent surgery.
“The operations are good, but the representative of Vallier does not know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first presented by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prediction came true last night, it is said that it was the woodpecker that Raimundo gave Melina as compensation for having lost the pleasure of getting the crown.
So it is or not, the fact is that today Melina begins the year of rule, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions, indicated directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the competition in Cartagena, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
This was the work of the man who identified the body of Alfonso Cano.
The criminal from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI criminologist Kali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of FARC chief Alfonso Cano by comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven CTI forensics this week, it’s time to “supervise” Elizaro Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerto Texas who spent 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to climb through the jungle for more than five days to reach a place where there were bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Valais and after completing the relevant courses, he became a specialist in forensics, where he studied skin friction, i.e. palms and stems.
During the week of Elizar's operation to identify a man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to take clothes for no more than three days.
Something great was approaching.
On Friday night, he arrived by helicopter from Caucus to Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two corpses, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten photographs of Guillermo Léon Saens' fingerprints (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses and much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Elizar matched the corpse's fingerprints to those in the pictures.
His eyes did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, a representative of Puerto Tejad was asked to confirm to the Minister of Defense Juan Carlos Pinson that he was the head of the RVSK.
Finding Fingerprints
For the specialist in the field of fingerprinting unit Sijin from Kali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos Elizar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez at a press conference about the operation against Kano is particularly significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous science, without errors, it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, fingerprinting specialists are involved in investigating crimes such as theft and murder and identifying detainees.
During detention, many criminals have fake IDs or do not have documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the database.
The researcher said that in case of theft, he had to carry away a piece of the wall of the house, because in this place the thief rested his hands to take possession of a safe full of jewelry and money.
“The walls are hard to work with because they are not comfortable surfaces for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a snapshot of the entire palm and identify the criminal who took part in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with liquor bottles around him.
In the course of the investigation, it was established that the crime could be suspected of a relative and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist in fingerprinting from CTI explained that a chemical or physical reagent is applied to the places where there are fingerprints.
When they appear, a spatula or tape is used to remove them.
After that, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or entered into the register.
“The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the television program about CSI.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not everything you touch leaves footprints.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People Defy New York City Authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped outside Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters heard the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the park next door.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday as they tried to re-enter Manhattan Square under the protection of a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to seize another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters flocked to Zucotti Square, where they wanted to get due to a court order that allowed “angry people” to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the dispersal, seizing a park in the north of the city where further arrests were made.
“Our idea is that since the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle for return to Zucotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a Wall Street representative.
Bray explained that the response of “angry people” to the evacuation of the tent town, which was ordered personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, "angry people" have begun to seize the new park, located at the junction of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York City and New Jersey, and the Trinity Church parish.
At least an hour they could occupy the place, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Bray could not name the exact number, but told Efe that he had seen several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization claims that several hundred people stood with tents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders went to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zucotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday, which will examine the legality of this morning’s dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters on their way there carried and distributed copies of the court order at the same time and even gave these copies to the police guarding the square, leading to “some small clashes,” Bray said, who said some police officers were beating protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of the Occupy Wall Street movement and forcing them to comply with “laws that were issued after the start of the seizure, or prohibiting demonstrators from accessing the park again with shops and other properties previously used.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of this court order, the city suspended the opening of public space and demonstrators were informed about it, but local laws prevent them from deploying tent stores and sleeping bags again.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protesters from Zucotti Square at dawn, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made, and the decision was made because the protesters “violed the law”.
Bloomberg said he gave the order to clear the square as it became "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses received threats" and neighbors feared "a deterioration in the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers,” a spokesman for the movement added, condemning the mayor for “disrespect for freedom of speech.”
Those responsible for the Wall Street Captures also indicated that they intend to organize “grand promotions” on Thursday, in collaboration with NGOs and trade unions, to recall the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program “Christmas of Russell Peters” on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Great Repair", a rescuer in "The Rescuers of Malibu", Bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
CTV announced today that Anderson, along with ballad-player Michael Buble and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1 TV show Russell Peters's Christmas as a very special Mary.
CTV today unveiled footage of a TV show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated online home pornographic video, where she appears along with her then-husband, drummer of the band "Mötley Crüe" Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding in a manger a doll depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian descent who recently starred as the host of Charlie Sheen's "My Cruel Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the special Christmas show of CTV is attended by Canadian singer Buble, who at the end of March married in Buenos Aires the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows a lot about scandals.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a “bitch” during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, revived after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and put an end to the round of decline, which began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from a devastating earthquake that has led to a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster suffered by the Rising Sun Country since World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 million - a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to pass.
After three consecutive loss-making quarters, the gross domestic product data from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
Registered in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.
The renaissance may be partly explained by the renaissance of buying machinery to rehabilitate areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% against a 0.9% decline in capital costs, which was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real turning point in the Japanese economy is not solely based on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for the crisis to be used to strengthen – or perestroika – infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan was awakened mainly by the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This figure increased by 1% under the influence of increased costs for cars, travel and recreation.
Stamped Yen
Tokyo granted the domestic market when the yen – the Japanese currency – became one of the “currency havens” chosen by investors who want to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and negative projections about the United States, a privilege that puts pressure, like a stone, on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for its low performance from July to September.
As long as markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the government of Yesihiko Noda does not reduce vigilance.
We need to be attentive to the continuing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flood in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, Minister of Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries showed clear signs of a decline in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts the world economy’s turnarounds, showed that major forces are slowing down.
It then fell four-tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone has even fallen below the 100-point average after falling eight-tenths to 99.13.
Athens again gives rise to doubts
Papadimos said the adjustment would be approved, but the conservatives would not sign any written commitment.
With periphery premiums for risk and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander the maze that leads to an exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “agreement” of the new transitional government of Hellas is imposed by the demands of Brussels, rather than the true conviction of political forces, is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lucas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the hundred-day period agreed upon in his appointment may not be enough to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterates his demand for new elections appointed on 19 February.
The government’s main task is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit, Papadimos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be crowned tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive branch.
A package of 24 programs to increase employment, reforms of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras's message does not clear up doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything."
The leader of the conservatives has taken a step further in his sentiments about the EU and the IMF, the organizations that need to unfreeze the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and explained that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
But the European Commission, still annoyed by the effect of Papandreou’s all-or-nothing referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume assistance unless the new government and the leaders of Greece’s main parties sign a “written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible.”
Economy ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafai said the troika's inspectors could "very soon" return to Athens to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, though the exact date has not yet been set.
In the Greek tangle there will be enough thread for a while.
Ms. Sofia: “These are instruments of progress and hope”
The Queen emphasized Spain's "main" position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has taken a prominent place in the world in the field of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades, the country has become the second largest donor in terms of cooperation instruments, whose “essence,” she said, is that it is “an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all of humanity, based on faith in people.”
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “absolutely necessary” to achieve the Millennium Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, and “especially with the goal of halving the number of people living on less than one dollar a day” – a level that is “fixed” by the United Nations.
Spain is “still working” to expand the network of recipients around the world and takes on this task with all the “responsibility”, says Dona Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements made during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will “ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, “the main recipients of these loans”.
There are “many achievements” and “many difficulties we face.”
The microcredit summit is becoming not only a platform for disputes, but also a platform that contributes to “two main goals.”
Thus, Her Majesty has explained that she hopes that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families will benefit from these financial services and one hundred million of these households will recover from the poverty they are immersed in.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world “went along the path begun years ago” by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as an “act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the instrument’s father as “an astounding idealist in the universal cause of poverty,” whose work has been known for 15 years, since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study its lending policies on the spot.
A year later, the first World Summit in Washington, D.C., and other meetings, such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, took place, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," Her Majesty said, whose connection to the project brought her the title of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid yesterday as a "poor banker".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by inviting those present to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jimenez said that solidarity is an “ethical imperative” for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic boom, as it is a “permanent commitment”.
Jiménez concluded that microcredit envisages a “serious and firm course to eradicate poverty” and that now “more than ever” governments in developed countries must work according to the criteria of solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to cost cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of cooperation for development”.
Secretary of State for International Cooperation Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez praised the “success” in giving “confidence” to the “depressed people, before whom all doors are closed”, and Valladolid Mayor Francisco Javier Le<0xC3><0xB3>n de la Riva welcomed everyone present in the city, who “opens its doors, embraced by the spirit of solidarity”.
CDU proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) on Monday 14 November in Leipzig passed without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also the chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the program, but arose in the fall, in particular, to satisfy activists who believe that the policy of the government is not as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps tomorrow with regard to Italy.
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was submitted for discussion by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted a few minutes, which merited their speeches by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, Europhile and Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the correct answer to the crisis is not less Europe, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro”.
For the chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
It could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that make it possible to strengthen the European Union’s control over the eurozone’s financial policies, but it could also affect the European Commission’s presidential election by universal suffrage, “to give Europe a face.”
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by Congress, the idea of which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that twenty-seven countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK opposes this, and CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also against it.
But the ground is ready.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member state on the board of the European Central Bank according to the size of the economy of each of them, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the situation in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the Congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation, which like to criticize "high" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe devotes a whole paragraph to the importance of “German-French friendship”, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing by.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is a hospital letter fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government launched an offensive against hospital bills.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the Fund for the Distribution of Family Benefits and deliver a speech on this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on combating social welfare fraud.
And to help this offensive, which arose from the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also a part of the right-wing campaign for re-election to the presidency, the majority wants to concentrate on the hospital lists.
First of all, in view of budget savings, the government intends to impose on employees of private companies the fourth day of unpaid leave before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the special consent of the employer, the sick employee will lose a salary in four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
The measure, which threatens to spawn a storm of anger but which, according to Les Echos, will lead to savings of 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely, to impose on civil servants one day without payment of sickness benefit (public servants still did not have to wait for the payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day wait for employees of the private sector).
Now that these issues are being discussed, the majority is also once again raising the topic of fraud, referring to abuses in the issuance of hospital sheets.
Control will become tougher, and if you are caught, you will have to return all payments you have illegally received,” Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Saturday.
As in other cases, the effect of the application was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
Indeed, they have been subjected to constant monitoring and political attacks since 2002, which bear fruit.
People in France are sicker than anywhere else in Europe.
First, let’s look at the numbers across the country.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million in daily compensation was paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.3 million, accounting for 5% of total health care expenditures.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for maternity leave and work-related accidents and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 million euros.
And, therefore, accounted for 2.5% of health-related expenditures.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital in 2010, compared with 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
An arithmetic average that hides some deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com found that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they didn’t take a single day of sick leave.
Another study, this time concerning health insurance, states that in 2010 37% of hospitals lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
If we compare these figures with those of our European neighbours, we can see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers found that between 1994 and 2001, the total absenteeism rate in France (whether for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The level of fraud associated with hospital bills is very low compared to "gray" employment.
As for the level of fraud, it is very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to a systematic inspection of hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, of the 1.5 million cases verified, CNAM found that 13 percent of the 285,000 short-term illness findings were “unjustified” or too long, which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked hospital sheets for more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inappropriate or unfounded", which is 132,000.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unreasonable” for the several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared, for example, with figures of "gray" employment.
According to UMP deputy Dominic Tiana, the author of the report on this issue in June, they amount to between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9,000 and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 million of unreceived budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papadimos said on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his coalition government were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," said the head of government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on the confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "principal task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the eurozone is "at stake," he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecasts a reduction in the country's budget deficit "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new government’s actions.
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, voiced his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the challenges of reducing deficits and debts and combating waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Reno, the European commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8,000 million loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, said that his words were enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and suicide with outside help, says the committee of experts
Canadians are denied death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
As for palliative medicine, the committee argues that the government, health institutes and doctors are working together to provide the best palliative care, not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in that direction.
This is one of the conclusions of the impressive report of the Royal Society of Canada, which was attended by six experts from different fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where circumstances impose this choice and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin with, experts refer to a recent study by the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Medicalization or not, but 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate by country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in a hospital.
On the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization entails abuse in use, that is, euthanasia or suicide with outside help against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference that the majority of such cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalized.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.
Suicide with outside help is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
It should be remembered that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 survey by Angus Reid, they believe that it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of life.
And 66% believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
As for people who assisted with suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As for the extension or termination of medical care for the patient, the situation is less unambiguous, say the authors of the report.
They also propose, among other recommendations, that the Penal Code should establish that legal termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires health professionals to be trained in a spirit of respect for the rejection of end-of-life medical care without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the committee urges the government, health care institutions and physicians to work together to develop the best palliative care possible, and not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee demands that it be applied when it does not serve to dull physical pain like euthanasia and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments from other experts
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already commented on the conclusion of the report of experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschant, a health law specialist, described the position of the experts who signed the report as “extreme” because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says Meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Desham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said, “There are warning signs and prohibitions in society.”
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expresses “categorical disagreement with the findings of the report, which she called a “euthanasia manifesto.”
Margaret Somerville, herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, contests, in particular, the report’s data on abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus condemns 'conspiracy'
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad held a demonstration yesterday in front of the building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad, who, with Russia’s support, resists him and condemns the “conspiracy” against his country, has intensified.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria’s neighbors Turkey and Jordan have called for the resignation of President Assad.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II became the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to cede power in Syria, where about 40 more civilians and members of the regime’s armed forces were killed.
“If the interests of his country were dear to Bashar, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new stage of political life,” the King of Jordan, a neighboring country with Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, expressed regret that Turkey’s mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been crowned with success.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, hinting at Syria, a neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the “expansion of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and countries such as Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh course against repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime’s armed forces were killed in the Daraa area of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed in a gunfight and heavy machine-gun attack in Jobara in the besieged city of Homs, according to this ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said that the country is approaching the end of the crisis.
In addition, he reacted sharply to the decision of the League of Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, in his opinion, is a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail.
Following its decision to exclude Syria, the League of Arab States is currently studying “the mechanism for the protection of civilians and requires the removal of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also called for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said had fallen into “paranoia.”
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan to overcome the crisis adopted on 2 November, which includes the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China called on Syria to implement a plan to get out of the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy's
Monti demands time from markets and victims from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form their team and implement a program that would require “victims” to restore creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi’s rule.
The former European Commissioner took part in discussions with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He will have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, composed of technocrats who are not members of parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of a program involving many victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting with the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote confidence by Friday to make sure the new government has enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monti presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of the country, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented on yesterday’s nervousness of the stock exchanges and bondholders, asking them for time.
“Democracy needs time to prepare the government and the program,” he said, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understandable.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but concerns arose again, particularly after the unexpected drop in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The appointed prime minister was supposed to form a team including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politicians”.
The new government will have to act until 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the speaker of the House of Deputies, the new government will receive a vote of confidence in parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti guaranteed that by taking office, he would work hard to ensure that Italy would once again become an important actor in Europe.
European Commissioner Olli Rehn said: “Despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed.”
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement its 2013 budget, despite a austerity plan adopted in recent months, called for, inter alia, new stringent measures.
Italy’s boss Emma Marchegaglia, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that has no growth can’t meet the deficit parameters.”
Known for his competence and independence as a European Commissioner (1994-2004), Monti represents the "change of the era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", a "professor", symbolizing the "challenge of seriousness" and "the other Italy", according to the authors of the forewords.
The great unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid imminent elections, as by April 2012, Italy must make payments on public debt in the amount of 200,000 million euros.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, the US agency specializing in nuclear danger confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to establish the identity of this scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the “possible military aspect” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “starting in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by explosive methods.”
In 1989 or 1991, he left the center to create a company that produces “nanodiamonds” in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then collaborated with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, until his return to Russia.
In its report, the IAEA cited “clear indications that Iran’s development of the nuclear detonator system was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technique well, but who also told the agency that he had worked most of his career on the technology as part of his home country’s military nuclear program.”
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to FBI statistics published on Monday, the number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by almost 50% between 2009 and 2010, while during the same period other forms of racial and religious violence decreased slightly or did not change.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in attacks against Jews and a 14% increase in the total number of crimes on religious grounds.
According to the FBI, the total number of hate crimes increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decrease in 2009, the number of these crimes is growing again, Human Rights First stresses, "an increase in violence against Muslims is particularly significant," the organization adds in an official statement.
“Human Rights First has long emphasized that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be treated as serious human rights violations,” said Paul Legandre, one of the group’s leaders.
“The U.S. government can and should do more to deal with these crimes, he adds, believing it can be done by improving police reports of hate crimes.”
“Hate crimes” in federal law are the legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King Jr. to punish acts of violence related to race, skin color, religion, nationality, and nowadays sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform and becoming like Facebook
On Monday, the microblog site Twitter made changes to the presentation of its platform, which will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new “activity” tab and other “names” allow you to track more easily and directly the activities of other “twitters”, Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) you are tracking, and those who are tracking yours.
This makes it possible to know if they will post messages, if they will subscribe to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being released across the network on Monday, Twitter press secretary Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known as intuitively quite incomprehensible and as using rather vague terms (RT to repost someone else’s message, #followfriday to recommend tracking other users), mostly bringing pleasure to experienced users, opens up thus to a wider audience, presenting users with something closer to the popular Facebook community.
On the network, users discussed this innovation with the help of "tweets" on the Internet.
“It’s useless, obsessive and too much like Facebook.”
Functional activity will help me better follow certain elements of my Twitter stream, wrote <0x40>dannykronstrom.
Austria-Hungary
The introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget into the Constitution
The leadership of a large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write the budget "golden rule" in the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible downgrades by the rating agencies of Austria's state credit rating (triple A).
Chancellor Werner Faymann personally announced the decision at the end of a meeting of the Council of Ministers, with Austrian public debt at 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of the norm of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria’s solvency had fallen by only one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have had to pay interest of three thousand million euros more each year, the vice chancellor and foreign minister from the Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger argued.
Thus, Austria is fulfilling the requirement of the Eurozone summit in Brussels on 26 October; Heads of State and Government have demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The decree, adopted by the Austrian government, resembles the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of a federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of GDP, and land, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to force public debt to fall below the 60% mark enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/2021.
Esihiko Noda
Threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yesihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would conduct new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the yen's value continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, if we consider the excessive volatility of the exchange rate of the yen, explained Mr. Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to the historic mark, which prompted Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has set a new record of strength since 1945.
But since then, the yen has grown steadily, driven by the purchases of investors who perceive it as a “shelter” in these turbulent times of the global economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the level that caused the latest intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro was over 160 yen.
The growth of the Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the volume of income of Japanese firms from abroad when converted into the national currency.
“Japan is fighting to rebuild itself” after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that ravaged the T<0xC5><0x8D>hoku region (north-east), said Mr. Noda, who fears that this rise in the yen will kill the fragile germ of recovery.
The world’s third-largest economic power resumed growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth of exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high price of the yen does not reflect Japan’s “fundamental economic performance.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Managing Director Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “appropriate steps” to make it clear that no further easing should be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing organization increased the purchase of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47,000 million), raising to 55,000 million yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 million) the ceiling of the amounts it allocates for the purchase of various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
Euro-zone
Stocks are rising, stock exchanges are fluctuating.
The risk of a debt crisis is undermining European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, European exchanges left on Tuesday, November 15, a little further into the negative zone.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4% and finished trading at the level of 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
Due to new difficulties with the repayment of loans by eurozone countries in a difficult situation, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
“Concerned investors are simply too worried about the risk of infection,” explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop under the weight of new doubts among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its gaze on Europe, and the exchanges will follow each other in a corridor of narrow changes until investors have confirmation that the situation has stabilized,” says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of concern about the future of the eurozone hits the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after the congress of the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel CDU on Monday, which adopted a resolution providing, in particular, the opportunity for a country in a difficult situation to leave the eurozone, without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates significantly higher than 6%
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a level of great concern.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield of Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These difficulties with interest rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the stock exchanges for time to restore the situation in Italy, which is under threat of paralysis under the weight of its debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the October 27 eurozone summit will be his government’s “principal task.”
Spain has been hit by market fire ahead of Sunday’s parliamentary elections.
The spread between interest rates on Germany and Spain’s 10-year debt obligations has reached a new historic high.
Waiting for growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3%, thanks to increased household consumption.
Despite this, Insee has revised down the second-quarter figure, with a drop of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, recorded an increase of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment of the entire euro area is expected at 11 am, the European Commission warns of the dangers of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be decided after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become an occasion to reflect on the fate and place of nuclear power.
The dispute will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options have been explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
Now we are 7,000 million people on the planet, demographic development will entail a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world’s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to make up for the growing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate imbalances – a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add one installation to its kit, resuming the construction of the station, which was interrupted after the accident on Three Mile Island.
Although the model of Germany based on renewable energy is sometimes cited as an example, reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the cost of electricity, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by an increased need for imported gas, in particular from Russia, a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be noticeable.
Consider the example of Denmark.
The European turbine champion, from whom it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the biggest consumer of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; causing carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices to be 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since in a globalized economy the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make illusory beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French refuse to pay, especially because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be remembered that the country’s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a plethora of international trade-focused small and medium-sized enterprises and creates many jobs that cannot be relocated to another industry.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6,000 million euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years if its manufacturer were to be shut down?
To solve the energy equation, one must recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy production.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy, maintaining the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue.
In France, we have a security body that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centers, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally recognized, are full of the same obsession with security.
Over the course of 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any consequences for humans or the environment.
In Chernobyl, a reactor device and an unforgivable human error led to a tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
The fruit of this step and the cooperation between the security authorities, operators and French and German designers, EPR, represents a project to counteract such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy professionals looking to build the reactor, stopping its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to Areva and EDF competitors, clearing the way for them to gain leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a good for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy’s immigration policy has been criticized from various sides – overloading of police, judicial and administrative services, subordinate to the policy of figures and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as a “human rights state”.
Then there was the administrative oppression of foreign students, which got into the news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberaci<0xC3><0xB3>n, 23 May) said that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and waiters".
But it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree on this point.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 stated that “900,000 unemployed would not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers” and on the left by Michel Rocard, who explained in 1990 that France “cannot accept the poor from all over the world”.
The only difference is the level of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of invading the territory of the Polish Hordes of Plumbers was felt by both left and right.
Both sides see immigration as a burden for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the level of generosity they will allow to show to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confined himself to banality, saying that “joint work will solve our immigration problem.”
This notion of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electoral advantage, but economically it is very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in a recent book summarizing the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Publishing House, 352), there is a broad consensus among specialists about the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment.
Restricting immigration leads to weakening growth and lowering employment.
Fears of immigrant influence are based on the notion that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled ones, provoking wage cuts.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than they are replacing the local workforce by doing jobs that lack the local workforce.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labor, and the most qualified - in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job offers.
Positive impact on wages
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants leads to the fact that the arrival of immigrants has a positive effect on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Perry estimated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity introduced by immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (among the American Nobel laureates there is a large proportion of naturalized immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also bring net profit to social security systems, giving an average of 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, in Germany, an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will bring a net profit (income minus expenses) of an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to the state budget during his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy at the beginning of his mandate was going to “teeth” to cling to the missing points of growth.
The teeth mentioned, which were used to scare away immigrants, gave the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; but at the same time fragile.
The European continent must remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and colonels in Greece.
Some believed that in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange a vote and make it as direct as possible.
Since the time of Napoleon the "Small" it is known that it comes from the superficiality of thinking.
A universal vote, while a prerequisite for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become a “tool of suppression,” as the Republican philosopher Etienne Washreau once said.
No, democracy requires much more - public space, public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is primarily a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the palinody of the truth-lie Greek referendum will have a double exposing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the struggle for democracy has now shifted and, in the opinion of many, Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We will not win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organised as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Carte blanche" for the absolute European monarch or jump with his feet tied into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of a joint, clear and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at the pan-European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and it is not known how many of them will have to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is completely subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is completely humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is necessary to urgently return the management of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce everyone’s debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
A way out of the crisis will require solutions at the pan-European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now demanding a European economic government.
Let it be.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has come to life is another madness and a new impasse.
We need to start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to “create” republicans.
A revolution of interests would not suffice.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build a Europe that is united on an economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine people’s European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Contactless chip cards are spreading more and more.
The World Chip Card Exhibition opens on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with 11% growth in global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards), exceeding, according to Eurosmart, 6 thousand million units.
The most important sector is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases by simply passing a map over the reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the field of contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France starts from a more modest position: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in circulation.
But the big stores are growing up.
This year, Carrefour released 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard.
In order to move to higher speeds, banks need to equip their customers with equipment.
“Two large organizations in France have pledged to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nebouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payments using a mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage in the development of a future means of payment, that is, a mobile phone.
So far, only a few devices are equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is necessary to make such transactions.
“They were postponed.
“But they really should fly out next year.”
“We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012,” explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
Banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced an experiment from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone’s approximately 200 customers and employees will be provided with cases that provide contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer that allows its customers to pay via mobile phones.
Terrorist Front Spreads from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about ties between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-established links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even said that Algerians are now convinced of this.
“The way these two organizations are using and the intelligence reports show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, without going into details.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
An investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger in January revealed two links.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocourt and Vincent Delori were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation carried out by French special forces.
Among the debris left over from the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone sim cards belonging to the terrorists.
The Axis of Terror
An analysis of the calls made indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has long lived in Maidiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a person allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a step forward, but we certainly need to wait for more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for many years that the sect is receiving financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent from Boko Haram’s actions and statements and her methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type that Aqmi uses.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressing Abuja to pay attention to the problems that Boko Haram is creating.
The fact is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally regarded this group as a community of enlightened people of no interest.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri at the mosque, school and under the imam-fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram—which means “Western education is sin”—promotes the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicized and requires strict adherence to the Sharia, and its activists have begun to fight against the ungodly central government.
It focuses mainly on churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed special activity, committing numerous attacks on police departments.
Abuja’s reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blocked the city and left behind 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will go beyond its northern legions.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for the action that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another one in Abuja.
In Abuja in June, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi fortified in Mali and Niger and al-Shabaab Somalis operating in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed readiness to share all available information.
The World as Republican Presidential Candidates See It
With respect to China, Iran, and helping Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listen to Republican presidential candidates, voters could believe it.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry, and others have been multiplying the loud but devoid of detail foreign policy statements that have traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
The slogans concerning China, Iran and aid to Israel are often mixed with each other.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the “Old Good Party”, threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of “manipulating their currency is a sensitive topic for America, irritated by the migration of entire branches of its industry to Asia.
Even worse, if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to understand complicated foreign policy, has been unable to overcome an emotionally charged position.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is at the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard of.
The Reagan Style
Romney also promised military strikes against Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb.”
He also vowed to step up military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the ranking of candidates, demonstrated a discouraging ignorance of cases.
He recently called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power — apparently without knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and seeks military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to use the US military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture of terrorism suspects, banned by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
All this is very far from the Republican candidate of 2008 John McCain, a heavyweight of foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president answer that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to lower his tone in the fight against terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the premature withdrawal of the “boys” from Iraq, his tricks in Libya, which brought him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive is not so simple.
The population sees a positive balance of national security under Obama, who eliminated Ben-Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military interventions that bind in the sand.
And, arguing that America needs to be restructured economically in order to revive its leadership, Obama is right.
The North Stream, a new gateway for Russian gas to enter Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It is designed to supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the orchestra’s performance and exquisite snacks, in the opening of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany under water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rutte jointly turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
According to the new gas pipeline, 27.5 million additional cubic meters of gas will be supplied to Western Europe every year by the first pipeline with a length of 1,224 km, connecting the Leningrad region with the land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
The second pipeline should be ready by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 million cubic meters of gas equivalent to the total consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
The Nord Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia by threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing the Nord Stream with the new German-Soviet Pact, hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is striving for greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of depriving Europe of energy, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
“This pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us,” Fillon said, opening the pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel enclosed in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, it was necessary to bypass the minefields left over from the Second World War.
“A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution,” said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing 242 Eiffel towers, without breaks along its entire length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers refused it because Sweden was not happy that the Russian state-owned company would settle permanently on its shores.
“In the event of an accident, we will shut down the flow of gas in less than a minute,” says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline will go into the air.
But this seems unlikely to the designers who designed the seams, designed to leak only once every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the condition of the gas pipeline will be carried out by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
The cigar-shaped device is introduced into the pipeline with a diameter of 1 meter and pushed forward by a flow of gas.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information about any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without the need for the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is carried out only at the expense of its pressure.
It is 200 bar on departure and 100 bar on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which was tasked with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
“Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas will actually be transported,” says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of works will be 7.4 million euros for two pipelines.
GDF Suez’s investment will be around $240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will recoup their costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The pipeline exits from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy shore planted with coniferous trees.
Valves 4.5 meters high form the output terminal of the gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before pumping it into German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity it will be 3 million per hour, and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine Brand Notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company fifteen years ago, will bring back the taste of the letter.
It has the scent of adventure, hours spent behind a letter in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by the rectangular black cover, by the rubber band, by the yellowish-white pages, as if yellowed with time.
However, the Moleskine notebook, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to launch designer notebooks.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant to the company, took responsibility for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique, moleskin - a lacquered cotton fabric used, for example, to cover benches.
It is claimed that this type of notebooks are highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine brought into line with today’s taste an old and forgotten thing that was iconic for avant-garde artists until the 20th century,” said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become a management brand at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We have come a long way from the production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
Setting the profile of a typical buyer is difficult because a notebook equally attracts a businessman, a student and a person of a free profession.
Moleskine buyers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded and educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 employees, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notebooks in Fnac bookstores, shops in the centers of small cities and was able to gain wide fame.
“We followed the spirit of the time and this new need to write despite the advent of email,” Maria Sebregondi explains.
This distinctive cultural trait accompanies the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the "Roundabout Way" exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched covers with a leopard pattern on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include handbags, pens, computer bags. The brand includes all kinds of support.
A success that gave rise to envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has written a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week of employment for people with disabilities begins today.
Despite a public charity policy launched in 2005, the rate of unemployment among disabled people is still double the average, 19% vs. 9% for the general population.
Disappointing?
“No,” said Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, the organization that organizes the Disabled Persons Employment Week.
“There has been a lot of progress in 15 years.”
"At that time, the proportion of unemployed was not 2 but 3 times higher."
“But there is still a lot of work to be done.”
I must say that for a disabled person there are still many obstacles to employment.
Among them, there are more elderly: 37% over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a rather low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and out of 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very common, which is 85% for the disabled, compared to 38% on average.
In short, these are all criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that make up the essence of the problem,” said Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about a mentality that is changing, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre Association commissioned by Cité found that the managers surveyed had low levels of disability knowledge and “presented themselves with solid people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally disabled.”
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of having 6% of workers with disabilities set out in a law passed in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
“Today we are about 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with the law.
Proof: The number of "taxable" organizations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased from 59,000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 million to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law that raised the tax put a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects an increase in consciousness, particularly in large enterprises.”
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with employees ranging from 20 to 49 have employees with disabilities, compared to 82% of organizations with employees ranging from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness"
Before fighting the Blues on Tuesday evening (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure they received from this friendly match.
We will not come to claim that there was a secret conspiracy between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to the podium at the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar reconciled.
Five months after his striker's joke in a match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
“I am very pleased with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he is Belgian.”
“I want to go further,” says player Lille.
As for the contrast between his achievements in the club and in the national team, this is one thing, - he justifies.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but I'm not in Belgium."
“I have to earn my glasses.”
Left in reserve, ahead of this match against France, in a game against Romania on Friday night, Hazard arrived in Saint-Denis to finally “blink”.
Not forgetting, however, the concept of "pleasure".
He supported Blue from the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always supported them, he confirms.
This, of course, also reinforces the special character of this match.
And especially the fact that on the other side are Mathieu (Debyushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We just crossed our paths."
“To be able to play against them is pure happiness.”
Leekens thought kindly of "pride."
"Pride" to play in a "holiday match."
“It’s a pride to also claim as a “neighbor” that France “has once again become a very high-level team” just a year after the injury in Nizza.
“Laurent Blanc was like a thunderbolt, he admires.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical athlete will fly in the same plane with blue leadership... to Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing,” he said.
“We’re building something, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France."
Portugal is very confident.
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his rematch against Bosnia (22.00) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
“By the end of those 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paula Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the national team, which he has been at the helm since September 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a match that needs to be played and Bosnia that needs to be won.
With 0-0 on Friday in Hell Zenica it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for more than an hour, it failed to achieve the cherished goal that would have calmed it.
“It’s a good result, which, however, entails a certain risk.”
But at its brightly lit de la Luz stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of the public, who should be delighted, although the match will be very tense," said the optimist, but prudent Bentoux.
“We expect a very tough match, but we are convinced that we can win,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
A draw on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
Nobody could get the Bosnians.
“It’s a good result, but there’s some risk,” Bento said.
“We will play against a team that has a lot of technical merits and the players have a lot of individual merits,” he added.
As was already the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the very beginning, "not giving them time to think".
It’s a good idea if it’s realistic this time around.
