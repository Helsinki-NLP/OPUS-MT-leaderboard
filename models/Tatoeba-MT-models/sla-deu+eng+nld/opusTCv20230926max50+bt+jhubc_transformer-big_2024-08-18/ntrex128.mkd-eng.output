Members of the National Assembly of Wales are concerned that they “look like mafia”
Some members of the assembly are surprised by the proposal to change their name to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This stems from plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be the subject of ridicule.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned it "rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not speak Welsh: in Welsh twp means "crazy/crazy", and pwp means "how".
A Plaid member said the party was entirely "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A member of the conservative party said his party was "libertarian" about the name change, but noted that the similarity between the words "Muppet" and "MWP" was great.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire-English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The National Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a law on the introduction of name changes, said: "The final decision on any words that will be used to appoint the members of the Assembly, of course, will be made by the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the commission announced the results of public consultation on proposals that indicated strong support for the assembly's appointment as the Welsh Parliament.
For the question of the name of the members of the assembly, the commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received the greatest support from public consultations.
Members of parliament are proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches for the assembly's president, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a bill on the changes within weeks.
The reform law will include other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules on disqualification of assembly members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will give the final vote on the question of their name when discussing the law.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was set in an attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are quiet as churches in Harlem face problems
“Historically, the old people I spoke to say there was a bar and a church at every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
He said the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People are socializing in a different way today,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods where people go on a regular basis.”
And for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as the leaders think, "and sooner or later, they will return to the same place from which they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced with residential buildings full of people who would not help the remaining shrines in the neighborhood.
“The majority of the people who buy apartments in those buildings are white,” he said, “and that’s why the day will accelerate when these churches will close completely because it’s unlikely that the majority of people who move into those apartments will become members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white-methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
The Congregation of Negroes practising their faith nearby takes ownership of the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Congregation during the reign of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of vendors at 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to employ or promote blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but as members of Father Johnson's parish had plans to rebuild it, they bought the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a “cultural treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carillon in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind, who switched to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in the last few months is a complicated story of architects and entrepreneurs, part brought by the unprofessional leaders of the church, and part of the episcopal diocese.
The church board – the governing body of the church, composed of non-professional leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with concern that the diocese would “request to transfer the costs” to the church board, although the church board was not involved in hiring architects and entrepreneurs sent by the diocese.
Some members of the parish complained of a lack of transparency by the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Child in California Diving for Lobster
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, authorities said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB television in San Diego that he dived with friends for about an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then rowed to the group to help get him out of the water.
Hamel stated that at first he thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but then "he realized that he was shouting, 'He bit me!
I was bitten!’
The whole key bone was visible to him," Hamel said, noting that he had noticed after reaching the boy.
“I called for everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hamel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to San Diego’s Radia Children’s Hospital, where he was treated as if he were in critical condition.
It is not known what type of shark was responsible for the attack.
The beach rescuer, Captain Larry Gilles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but decided the shark was not of a dangerous species.
Gils added that the victim sustained traumatic injuries in the upper torso.
Authorities closed the beach on the side of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's Plans Enter UK Beauty Market
Sainsbury's takes over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty shelves in the style of department stores full of professional assistants.
As part of a significant push into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn beauty market in the UK, which continues to grow as fashion and household sales decline, the large beauty shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and will be featured in more stores next year as well.
The investment in beauty came after supermarkets began looking for ways to take advantage of the shelf space that was once intended for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its supply of beauty products to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing brands L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with branded areas similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also re-launching its Boutique makeup series, so most of the products are vegan-friendly, something that younger consumers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury stores, the first of which opened in Cradon, South London, last week, and the second opened in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Buying online and tending to buy smaller amounts of food on a daily basis at local stores means that supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coop, director of Sainsbury’s, said stores will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discounters Aldi and Lidl with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury’s began placing Argos stores in hundreds of stores, and also introduced numerous Habitat stores after it bought both chains two years ago, which, according to them, increased grocery sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its beauty and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots shortly after 2000, but the collaboration ended after disagreement over how to divide profits from chemical stores in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury’s sold 281 of its pharmaceutical stores to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Lloyds was said to play a role in the plan, adding a series of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty shelves to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit every need, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a must-have destination for beauty that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones has left "outraged" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal with his branded lifestyle business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their Truly brand of household products and accessories.
The couple's business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of the morning program announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, withdrawing from their lucrative branded lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new major deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “enraged” when a television gold girl admitted during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m – meant she no longer had time to devote to their Truly brand of home-made products.
The business is linked to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was said to double Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
As 37-year-old Willoughby told Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones quickly left Britain for one of his weekends.
One source said: "Truly has always been at the top of Holly's priorities.
It should have been her long-term future that would follow her in the next two decades.
Her decision to withdraw all concerned caught them absolutely unprepared.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, it was so close to opening.
At Marlow’s headquarters there is a warehouse full of ready-to-sell products.”
Experts believe that leaving this hostess for the morning program, which is one of Britain’s highest-paid stars, could cost the firm millions due to large investments in pillow and candlestick products, up to clothing and household products and the potential for further delay.
It could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined them as president in March.
The two go on vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is set to become the brand’s ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant MacPartlin as host of I’m a Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said, “We don’t comment on his business ventures.”
A Serious Conversation "And Then We Fell in Love"
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media for commenting on what some would consider “non-presidential” and because he was so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump said his voice was disguised as a “newscaster.”
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting after Trump assessed their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations on denuclearization have been postponed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see an "appropriate response" from the United States to North Korea's early disarmament moves.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump takes a much more optimistic view of his speech at the rally.
"We agree very well with North Korea," he said.
“We should be at war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have this great collaboration.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — missile tests had ended, hostages had been freed, and the remaining U.S. troops had returned home.
And he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we're going to have 200 people standing right here," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island and claimed hundreds of lives
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok was displaced, no elemental disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for receiving international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they were very clear that they did not seek international assistance, so it is a challenge," Mr. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is a team that will travel to Palu, it is not yet certain that foreign personnel will be able to work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if they would allow international agencies to contribute to aid efforts.
Due to the earthquakes that are constantly affecting Indonesia, the country remains desperately unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, they are not a common sight in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, although a warning was issued, likely contributed to the loss of lives.
At the best time, traveling through many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
A major point in President Yoko Widodo's election campaign was the improvement of Indonesia's old infrastructure and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But the lack of funds has gripped Mr. Yoko's administration in the face of re-election next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other old weapons.
Daniel Starage of the Liverpool team equals against Chelsea
Daniel Starage saved Liverpool from a loss in the Premier League with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Xerdan Shakiri handed the ball to Starage about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal, while his team lost 1–0.
He switched the ball from the left side before heading for the distant stand.
The ball moved high above the hexadecimal as it turned to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally passed through the jumped Cup of Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
“He was just trying to get into that position, to get to the ball, and players like Shack are always handing out as much as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time as possible,” Starage told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching and I just touched her and I didn’t think much about it and I just shot her.”
Chelsea led 1–0 in the half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker gave a fifth back to Matteo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in that attack, before kicking the ball almost to half the pitch and then sprinting to half of Liverpool.
They quickly approached Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> in the middle of the field.
He then fired a missile, leading Hazard to the 16th.
Hazard went through the defense and finished in the long-distance kick-off net alongside Allison Becker at Liverpool.
Liverpool will fight against Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Nepal, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early on Sunday.
Many people have been reported trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in a 7.5-magnitude earthquake that struck on Friday and caused waves 20 feet high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho spokesman said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was ravaged by the collapsed buildings.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Murder After Woman Stabbed to Death
A murder investigation was launched after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A forty-four-year-old woman was found at 7:55 p.m. with stab wounds on Grayson Moves on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police asked people in the area who had seen or heard anything to make statements.
Detective Inspector Brian Ohion said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I would ask people who were near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear something suspicious contact us.
“I also want to ask people, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on their car cameras to contact us because they may have information that is important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and was found in a facility.
In the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and, as police said, they will inform the victim's close people.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moves had just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him he was not allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents were told it would be hours before they could return.
Someone heard a police officer tell a man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
There was a woman there, covered in tears.
She keeps saying, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 a.m., two police vans were at the border, and another one was outside.
A number of police officers were standing at the border watching the apartments.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Anonymous Crime Fighters at 0800 555 111, citing an entry 247 dated September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament became the latest memory blow in the quarrel over "rewriting history"
Her persecution would be poetic justice for his "Taliban" destruction of a number of cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become a target.
The iconoclast of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will sacrifice himself for the works of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Cromwell’s beautiful presentation of Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of 19th-century thinking and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many believe, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, that Cromwell is a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is entirely accurate is the subject of a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
Pig-killer rips open and kills Chinese farmer
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a torn artery, covered in blood near a barrel at a market in Liupanshui in Gitsou province, South China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xinjiang, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door from the neighboring pig stall.
He stated that there was a large boar in the barrel with blood on the muzzle.
A forensic examination confirmed that a <0xC2><0xA3>550-pound boar ripped the farmer apart and killed him, according to the report.
"My cousin's leg was bloody and torn," said the cousin, given the surname "Wu," according to a quote in Guiyang's evening news.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to either Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the evening news that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on other people, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a <0xC2><0xA3>650-pound pig had pinned a Welsh farmer to his tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “activator.”
“They’re just playing.”
They like to snack, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone on purpose.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rose Remains Will Bring Heavy Rain to Southwestern U.S.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves through the cold waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will bring rain floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the next few days.
Rose brought winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5.00 a.m. east time on Sunday and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and moves eastward to the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula on Monday, as a tropical storm begins to bring great tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Rose will bring up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture with depression approaching will create heavy rains in the southeast over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rain will cause sudden flooding, the flow of rubble and possible landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause rainfall that in some places will be approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
A maximum of 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible due to rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
In particular, it is recommended not to go to the desert on foot if possible from tropical rain.
Heavy rain can cause canyons to become turbulent rivers, and thunderstorms will bring locally strong winds and dust.
The approaching depression will bring locally heated rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rains of more than half an inch are possible, which can cause rivers of rubble and slippery roads.
This would be the first rain in the region of their wet season.
Occasional tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, before rains spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
The rain will spread to the "four corners" on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
In October, intense temperature changes are expected across the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics remain at high temperatures.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in the temperature at short distances.
An excellent example of a dramatic temperature difference will be in the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 20-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to recreate and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to have a warm start in October, with high temperatures ranging from the southern plains to the northeast.
The city of New York could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our longer-term forecast indicates the possibility of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. until the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brad Cavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million people watched the thrilling testimony on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christina Blasi Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the hopeless political situation continued, with speakers interrupting Friday’s regular last-minute reversal programs: Jeff Flake, an Arizona senator, made a deal with the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that Cavanaugh had taken her piano and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his passionate testimony, said he was 100 percent certain that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people, as reported by Nielsen, watched it on Friday.
The company counted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to the other networks they displayed, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring people looking at offices.
To show it better, it’s an audience the size of a playoff competition in football or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose leaders strongly attacked Kavanaugh's appointment, led the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderately Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him being called by protesters on Friday morning as he tried to get in the elevator for the hearing of the court committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while being reprimanded, all of which were broadcast live on CNN.
"They're standing right in front of you," a woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth on earth?"
He was told, “You have power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the elevator door was closed, he would have more to say during the committee's hearing.
Cable and radio networks all covered hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was due to vote to advance Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if there was an agreement with the FBI to consider the charges against the nominee next week, which was requested by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After a conversation with Koons, and with several senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was of great importance, as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have had enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing politics" over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview next to her on the paper's front page, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her so-called "Checkers" Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should raise mutual costs is "completely absurd".
Wade Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dieteon Simson for Death of Louisiana State University Athlete
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
Twenty-year-old Dieteon Simpson has been arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, Baton Rouge police department said.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson’s DNA on them, a WAFB partner told CBS.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to shooting Wade and killing him.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
An East Baton Rouge parish pathologist's office released a preliminary report on Friday, where the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head to the neck.
The department thanked the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the area for the help they gave in the investigation that led to the arrest.
The athletic director at Louisiana State University thanked the police for their “action in search of justice.”
Simms was 20 years old.
The 6.6-feet beck grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for Louisiana State University.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 catches per game in the last season.
On Friday morning, the coach of the basketball team at Louisiana State University, Will Wade, said the team had been "destroyed" and "shocked" by the death of Sims.
“This is what you care about all the time,” the coach said.
Volcano ejects ash on Mexico City
The ejection of ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern settlements of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Sunday not to go to the volcano after activity began in the crater and 183 emissions of gas and ash were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was followed by more groanings and tremors.
Images on social media show a thin layer of ash on cars in Mexico City's urban areas, such as Sochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen increased activity on a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote's anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with police for public order and peace and after thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote to secede Catalonia.
A group of masked separatist supporters held by the police for public order and peace threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that would normally be full of tourists.
Later in the day, fights broke out as well, and police used batons to suppress fights.
For more than a few hours, independence groups shouted "No forgetting, no forgiveness", while trade union protesters shouted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, the local press said.
Tensions remain high in the region, a year after Madrid characterized the October 1 referendum as illegal, but it was celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low due to boycotts by people opposed to secession.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police violently tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped overnight on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
Demonstrations were held, but they had to change their route.
The 68-year-old electrician, Narcissus Termes, who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes Catalonia has a chance of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite winning a vital but narrow victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's independence parties struggled to keep the pace this year with many of their most prominent leaders either in self-elected persecution or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Forty-two-year-old mechanic Hoan Puig, recording a protest in support of police, said the conflict was supported by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more intense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who are in prison before a trial last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londoners Arrested After Driving A Car Into A House
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after repeatedly driving a car into a house in London.
The incident occurred at Balinagaard Crescent on Thursday at around 19.30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said damage was caused to the gate and the building itself.
At some point, he may have been shot with a self-propelled gun at the car.
Menga's score brought Livingston a 1–0 win against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
The advanced Livingston captivated the Rangers by signing Steven Gerrard, with his only two losses in 18 games, as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's score proved to be significant as Gary Hold's side climbed to a level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's side was left without a win in the championship this season and will face leaders Harts next week, behind whom they lag by eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continued undefeated in the division for six games, and coach Holt still hasn't faced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed the opportunity against the cruel guests
Holt's team had to lead for a long time before they scored, and their directness caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way through, but dragged the attack around the goal, then Alan Litgov could only direct his efforts away after skating played Craig Halkett's head kick over the goal.
The guests gladly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could create problems with the set actions.
That’s how the ultimate goal came about.
The Rangers missed a free kick, and Livingston got the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Menga together, who only with a touch scored a goal from the center of the sixteenth.
Until then, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but they could not break the defense of the hosts, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly for the most part did not play.
This scheme continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos was rescued from Kelly.
Scott Pitman failed to score due to the skill of Ranger goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Litgov took the ball away from yet another set action by Livingston.
Livingston's 16th was repeatedly passed and defended, while two penalty requests – after Halkett's challenge to replace Glenn Middleton and one for handball – were rejected.
“Phenomenal” by Livingston – analysis
Alasder Lamont at BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal game and result for Livingston
They were excellent, continuing to exceed the expectations of this uphill path.
Their playing style and character barely changed after their return to the top, but much of the credit goes to Holt for the way he galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, managing a super-organized defense, but Menga still kept Conor Goldson and Joe Voral on standby.
Still, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
As long as they were once good under Gerard's leadership, they are now lagging behind by the same standards.
Their last game was weak – they only managed to open the hosts once – and that’s a little bit of awareness for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Colonia
There were smiles and blue skies on Sunday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
They have worsened due to problems including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to the Colony to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but many supporters came close to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also spoke out, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Opposing protesters portray the visitor's split, famous as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died after colliding with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood and Evelyn Streets, a major traffic jam in Deptford, in the southeast of the city at around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and an ambulance arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The collision occurred months after the death of another cyclist in a car accident on Childers Street where the driver escaped, about a mile from the collision on Saturday.
Metropolitan police said officials were working to identify the man and inform his family.
Roadblocks have been set up and buses have been diverted and it is recommended that drivers avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Police Officers Wounded in Riots
Six prison police officers have been injured in unrest in a high-security men's prison, the prison's office said.
The unrest broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9.30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Specialists from the Tornado unit were brought in to solve the riots, which involve eight inmates and are confined to one wing.
Police officers were treated for minor injuries at the scene.
A prison spokesman said: “Specially trained prison staff were instructed to deal with the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be handed over to the police and may spend extra time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the governor of the prison had received hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, police for public order and peace were called to prison to deal with serious unrest in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (can be useful for dry areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it is likely to happen early next week when the remaining force of Hurricane Rosa will pass through the desert southwestern region, bringing the risk of sudden flooding.
The state weather station has already issued warnings of possible flash floods for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, all the way to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and State Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route through Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix State Meteorological Station tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within the 200-mile range of Phoenix since 1950!
Catarina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the State Hurricane Center predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches at the edge of Arizona's Mongolia.
Other areas of the desert southwestern region, including the central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to have 1 to 2 inches, with isolated locations up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of risky areas for sudden flooding, the rain of the Rose can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rain is likely to be beneficial because the southwestern region is hit by drought.
“According to the U.S. Sushi Monitoring Authority, nearly 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category,” the report said.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa has led to landslides everywhere on Mexico’s Lower California peninsula.
Rosa, still hurricane-strengthened on Sunday morning with winds of a maximum of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heading north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and is decreasing.
Therefore, rains are expected in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rain in parts of Mexico can be intense and pose a significant risk of flooding.
“It’s expected to rain 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sonora, with a maximum of 10 inches of rain possible,” it said.
Rose will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then move up through Arizona and in southern Utah until late evening hours on Tuesday.
"The main danger that is expected from Rosa or her remains are the very heavy rains in Lower California, southwestern Sonora and the desert southwestern region of the United States," the State Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to bring life-threatening sudden flooding and debris flows, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsamer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace on Midsamer Norton around 4.00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital and is in a stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have asked if anyone has a cell phone recording of the incident, to step forward.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the greatest anger and anger” of the Democratic Party.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the most brutal and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffered the greatest anger and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christina Blasy Ford's accusations of sexually assaulting her decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford testified at the hearing and about her accusations.
The president said on Saturday that "Americans saw Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" that day.
"The positive vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an impeccable record of public service," he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the early elections.
“Five more weeks until one of the most important elections of our time.
“I’m not running, but I’m really fighting,” he said.
“I’m everywhere and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump said the Democrats had a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key vote for Kavanaugh's nomination in the Senate is expected no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many carried away by the huge waves hitting the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of 6 meters (18 feet) struck the coast at sunset, behaving many in certain death and destroying everything in their path.
After a magnitude 7.5 earthquake, a tsunami struck.
“When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and were not fleeing immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster mediation agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come on its own, dragging cars, trees, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled through the high seas at speeds of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency showed many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent tremors continued to shake the coastal city on Sunday.
A series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more than the energy released by the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
The city's geographical position, which lies at the end of a long, narrow coast, may have intensified the size of the tsunami, they said.
Nugroho described the damage as "volume" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found stuck under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could increase along the coast 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication "was completely damaged without any information" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," they said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami hit Palu, although authorities said the waves came at about the same time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building can be heard screaming furiously, warning people on the street downstairs about the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water slammed into the shore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recording.
The quake and tsunami caused a power outage that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military began sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people still desperately need food and other basic necessities.
The airport was reopened only for aid and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's really bad.
While World Vision personnel from Dongala safely arrived in the city of Palu, where employees took refuge in tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they passed through scenes of desolation along the way, Mr Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's really bad.
Even as aid groups began grim attempts to start aid for the disaster, some complained that foreign aid experts had been prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start arriving if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Auli Ariani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can receive international aid, but it still has no status.”
As the second night of the Palu earthquake and tsunami fell on Friday, friends and families of the missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would ease the black story of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been stuck under the hood for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian state paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandaghi added, were his students.
"As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon told how, when news of the demolition of the Roa Roa hotel began circulating in the paraglider community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp messages to competitors from Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
But his messages ended only with a gray stigma instead of a son.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while charging an ATM at the Newport Pier.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who supplemented an ATM at Newport on the quay on Friday morning, according to a press release from Newport Police Station.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish it with money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "ran from behind the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money that was intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw more suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not give a specific number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with any information on their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yej
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Yay.
The change was posted on Twitter on Saturday. He wrote: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
Forty-one-year-old West wore the nickname Yay for a while and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change came just before his guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who had to cancel for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Although he uses it as an abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yea' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and that's where 'you' means," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it is us.
He departed from Kanye, which means the only one, to Yay alone, a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, Jay Z, also uses his name with or without a dash and all capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO says it will not use military force on civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country draws closer to the 50th anniversary of the bloody student reprisals.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to repress the Mexican people".
The military shot peaceful protesters in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooted in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly aid to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double its research resources in the field, investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Li, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said in a statement.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal strategy for AI.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: aiming to be number one in AI innovation by 2030.
“Doubling the AI budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next discovery in AI,” Lee said.
The doubling of funds could double the chances that the next major achievement in the field of AI will be made by the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most successful companies in the world.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later served as director of Microsoft Research and president of Google’s branch in China.
Lee thanked the U.S. government for previous technology competitions as a challenge in robotics for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and asked when the next competition would be, in order to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. often need to work hard to get state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired experts from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. improve its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically offered to doctors of science by artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
China’s State Foundation for Natural Sciences funds people in academic institutions similar to the way the Foundation for Natural Sciences and other government organizations donate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is to include industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of an Authorized Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, they currently invest more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation requiring the creation of a National Artificial Intelligence Security Commission has not been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
People in Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change her name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked her EU and NATO membership applications.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments agreed in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's Orthodox population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the exit would meet the minimum 50 percent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum card read: "Are you in favor of NATO and EU membership by accepting the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying to allow entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Gjorgievska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A change of name requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout stood at 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I went out to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Djose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko gave their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country's name, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, on September 30, 2018 in Strumica.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and chairs in front of tents set up by people who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter with our heads raised high, not from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we still have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said the “yes” result would be a “certificate of our future.”
The poll, published last Monday by the Institute for Political Research of Macedonia, showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonian television Telma, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent will vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government's policies since it came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero at Manchester City passed the entire defense of Brighton for a goal
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling quickly defeated Brighton in a 2–0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his shot look so simple in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the sequence.
He quickly passed between Brighton's three defenders before entering the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four "greens".
Bypass one defender before running a few others on the edge of Brighton's 16th.
He then handed it to the left of him, to Sterling.
The English striker used his first approach to the sixteenth to return the ball to Aguero, who with his right foot beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, with a single shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky to have a goal at the time.”
But the initial advantage of the "heavenly blues" gave Sterling in the fight for the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got a long ball in Brighton territory in that game.
He sent a beautiful direct ball along the left side to Leroy Shane.
Shane touched her several times before leading Sterling to the distant stable.
An attack by the "heavenly blues" brought the ball into the net before it went out.
City will fight Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match at 12.55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar Arena, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against Rockies
Since the Nationals were eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another start.
But always-competitive Scherzer hopes to stand in the central square on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications for the playoffs for the Rockies, who lead one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies had at least a "joker" for a spot with a 5–2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still struggling to establish their place in the first division.
“Although we’re not playing for anything, at least we’ll be able to throw knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd and the other team is likely to play at the highest level from any point I’m going to face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in that?"
The Nationals have yet to release a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to allow Scherzer to throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will start for the 34th time, coached throwing on Thursday and will throw normally rested on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand side is 18–7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 strikeout points in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rallies in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in early elections.
“Everything we’ve done so far will be put on the line in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important choices of our time.
“This is one of the big, big — I’m not running, but I’m really fighting, so I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see these horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power using all the means at their disposal, you see the malice, the ugliness.
They don’t care who they hurt, when they have to run over in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “wrathful, mean, ugly, and untruthful.”
He mentioned Democratic Senator Diana Feinstein, appointed by the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, to which the audience reacted with shouts of resentment.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, and no, I wait a minute – it was a very bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Laborers are no longer accepting different opinions.
They are not tolerated by those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted against me, it was hardly a surprise.
However, I am only the last in the line of members of parliament from the Labor Party who have been told that we are not welcome – just because he is expressing his opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she took a firm stance against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Nottingham's East Labor Party meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In most of my eight years as a member of the Labor Party’s parliament, Friday night’s council meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of most meetings, and the promise of a “softer, gentler” policy has long been forgotten, if indeed it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labor Party, and any opinion is judged whether it is acceptable to the party leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues with whom I felt we had previously shared a similar political opinion began to expect me to completely change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never have taken, whether it was national security or the EU’s internal travesty.
Whenever I speak in public, and it really doesn't matter what I say, there's a critical harassment of social media that calls for condemnation, a renunciation of the center's policies, telling me I shouldn't be in the labor party.
I am not the only one with this experience.
In fact, I know I have more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me are usually political.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face numerous sexist or racist harassment every day, but never withdraw.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how levels of abuse have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labor Party should practice a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different opinions and with every demand for “no trust” or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower opinions.
I’ve received a lot of advice over the past two years telling me to keep my head down, not to be so loud, and then “everything will be fine.”
That’s not why I came into politics.
Even 32 years ago, when I joined the Labor Party as a student, provoked by the negligence of Thatcher’s government that literally left my classroom to collapse, I struggled to improve public services for those most in need, whether as a local councilor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in any way about my political views and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who supported the request on Friday, all I want to say is that when the country is heading towards Brexit, which will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labor Party.
But I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labor Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no matter how reprehensible threats or political opportunism I survive, nothing will deter me from acting in a way that I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for East Nottingham.
Air 38 – 17 Melrose: The undefeated Air goes to the top
The two late points may have altered the final score somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ear deserved the triumph in this wonderfully entertaining rugby match of the day.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated side of the ten.
In the end, it’s all due to their superior defense, as well as their improved chances, that the home team has taken, and coach Peter Murci has the right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested through our matches so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Praise for Ear, they took better chances than us.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute point, converted by Fraser Climo, gave Ear an advantage, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, given for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to improve the numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed an unconverted point.
Klimmo delayed Ear's lead with a penalty, before, exactly at halftime, he scored a point, so he converted a solo point to score 17–5 for Ear on the rescue.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Andreson's point, converted by Baggot, cut the lead to five points.
There was then a long delay due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was brought out on a stretcher, and from the start, Ear continued to struggle with Stafford McDowell's point, converted by Climo.
Ear's VD captain, Blair McPherson, then received a yellow card and again, Melrose charged for Bruce Colvin's extra man with an unconverted point at the end of time with relentless pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to knock down Climo without the ball, McPherson won a touchdown from the penalty line on the back of the sharp attack on Ear.
Klimmo converted, as he did almost from the start again, after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's shot and sent winged player Gregor Henry to the fifth point for the home team.
The star of "Still Game" looks ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran appears ready to move into the hospitality industry after it was revealed he was named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old starred as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The duo announced that the next ninth season will be the last and it seems that Kirnan is planning for life after Craigling.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at Scottish Sun said that Kirnan was trying to get involved in Glasgow's "successful restaurant trade".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia surrounded by land hopes that the court will reopen the path to the Pacific
Sailors patrol a covertly faked naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have placed a blue sea flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are lined with the motto: “The sea is ours rightfully.
It is our duty to return.”
Across mainland Bolivia, the memory of the coast lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still fresh, as is the longing to sail again across the Pacific Ocean.
Those hopes may now be the highest in decades, while Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on Oct. 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has the momentum, the spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course expects a positive outcome,” said Roberto Kalsadija, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the international court on the big screens everywhere in the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will rule in favor of Bolivia’s lawsuit that, after decades of volatile talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign sea exit.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also depends heavily on Monday's verdict.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said solemnly at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that it will not change much even to rule in their favor.
The Dutch-based UN body does not have the power to assign territory to Chile and said it would not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
The International Court of Justice's ruling comes just six months after the final arguments suggest the case "wasn't complicated," said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
And over the past four years, they may have pushed back the cause of Bolivia instead of improving it.
"The current Bolivian administration has exploited the problem of access to the sea for its own purposes," Zarate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined Chile’s remaining goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, the Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an incredible opportunity to open an era of good relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreement," he said.
Kalsadiya also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the sea problem as political support.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen if it can’t trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of restarting blocked nuclear diplomacy more than three months after Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a “fiction” to believe that extended sanctions and U.S. objections to a declarative end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of massive hats on the way to the biggest stores near you
If you want to improve the size of your collection of caps or completely block the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a series of crazy oversized hats for their SS19 collection on the runway that dazzled the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats launched Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations down the track.
The piece that stood out from Valentino was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide rim in the form of feathers that flooded the model's head.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons with zircons, a magic hat, and even pineapple, but they’re not designed to warm your head.
Tom Brown also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation resembled a diving equipment completely with glasses and a diving tube, and the other looked like a melted cornet ice cream.
And if you go on with a huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
It’s important to note that the big hats can come to the stores near you.
The oversized hats came very quickly after La Bomba, the straw hat with a two-foot-wide rim worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic fashion house behind the too impractical hat spread across social media sent another big creation down the runway, a straw beach bag almost the size of the model it was pulling.
The dark orange raffia bag, with a raffia border and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out in Jacques-Mousse's La Riviera SS19 collection at Fashion Week in Paris.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see the big hats and beach bags in stores next summer, because the designer has caused such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for too many accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding exam results, which is only enhanced by individual and group success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students everywhere in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as global citizens.
As an educational center that can design and implement tailored school programs, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desired as an elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it will make him scornful.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will strike him in the soul.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages outperform all other subjects with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages achieved a higher score of “5+”.
Data collected from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved a higher "5+" score in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also achieved a "5".
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly acquire in the future.
Languages now, as an elective subject, are seen at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in independent school programs, as elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 percent of the reasons employers cited them as failing to fill jobs were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative in order to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more jobs requiring languages, these skills are indispensable in a globalized world.
No matter which career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future with such a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically give the polyglot an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 U.K. adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to speak, and French was the only language spoken by over 10 percent, i.e. 15 percent of people.
Therefore, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
Having multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will equip children with better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will differ according to the languages it teaches.
Several schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important in the UK when looking into the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what the interests of your child are, there will always be a number of languages to choose from in independent schools, with professors who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may bring.
At present, it cannot be denied, in the global business environment, that languages will continue to be vital to the country’s future, so this must be replicated in schools.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the young people of Scotland.
"Il faut bien le faire" (it must be done).
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will lead the Lakers to San Diego on Sunday.
The wait was almost over for fans who wanted to see LeBron James start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first match of the preseason Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play, it is still not decided.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule ahead of the Lakers' season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Youtube channel for Trump's rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump launched a series of rallies as part of the campaign, tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled next week, including visits to sloping places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm his election to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court is at a standstill, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans could lose control of Congress by voting in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia rally tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. East Coast Time Zone tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online with a live stream on YouTube.
This week, Trump is likely to address a Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected delay of up to a week in the Senate as the FBI’s investigation continues.
The primary goal of the series of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum for the November election.
That’s why President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week are aimed at “encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important in his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season begins,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at the Wesbanko Arena in Willing, tonight's rally could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania as well as Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro news.
Saturday marks Trump’s second visit to West Virginia in the last month, a country he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not good for Morrissey that the president has to come in to improve the popularity of polls," said Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Cup Rider 2018: The US team showed courage in the fight to keep the hopes alive at the start of individual matches on Sunday
After three one-sided seasons, Saturday afternoon's fours might have been exactly what Ryder Cup needed.
The sophistication of luck is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, and most of all in such matches.
Who would you say is happiness now?
"They had a lead of six points, and now they're four, so we're a bit lucky, I guess," Jordan Spitt said after the end of today's competition.
The Europeans have, of course, the advantage of a four-point lead and a further twelve games.
Americans, according to Spit, feel that they have a weak wind in the sails, although they have enough incentive, if nothing else, then the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spit was great and leads by example.
Those loud cries of celebration became increasingly loud during his game, with a key blow leading to a four-to-four tie when he and Thomas had two misses after two rounds.
His blow to the match at 15 was greeted with a similar shout, telling you that he believes the American team is not out of the game.
"You just have to get deep and take care of your match," Spitt said.
That’s all that’s left for every player.
18 holes to score a point.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but beautiful duo of Europe are four out of four and can’t go wrong.
Mollywood were the only couple without bad blows on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bad blows on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the previous nine on Friday morning.
That series and the way their energy seems to flow to and from this noisy group ensure that they are the players who will win on Sunday and that there will be no other popular players who will ensure a potential European victory when the sun sets behind Le Golf National, except Fleetwood or Molinari.
Prefer both at the same time on different holes.
However, talks about European glory remain unwarranted.
Beetle Watson and Webb Simpson quickly deal with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of doubles, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A failed strike and two doubles of the first nine buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole they never managed to get out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Couples and foursomes are so fascinating to see from close up because of the interaction between partners, the advice they give, the advice they don’t obey, and the way the strategy can change all at once.
The Europeans played better as a team and thus achieved a significant lead in the last day, but the season of fours also showed that the US team can fight even though some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europeans lead 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter with a solid lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after Saturday's lead in doubles and fours 10-6 ahead of the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories while Tiger Woods struggled to take the lead at Le Golf National on four points.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's European team, which struggled to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the U.S. team, which had many draws in the morning doubles and won the series 3–1.
The Americans resisted more in the fours, winning two matches, but could not reach the lead.
Jim Furrick's team needs eight points out of 12 individual games a week to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, called "Mollywood" after the sensational weekend, are the second pair in general to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in doubles, they played well and beat the worn-out Woods and American novice Bryson Deschamps with an even more pronounced 5&4 score.
Woods, who ran through two matches on Saturday, at times played well, but now lost 19 of 29 matches in doubles and fours and seven times in a row.
Justin Rose, resting while the morning doubles lasted, returned as a partner to Henrik Stanson in the fours with a 2&1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Coepka – ranked first and third in the world.
However, the Europeans were not all after their pleasant, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time dominant winners Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas set the measure for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a decisive 2&1 victory over Spanish John Rahm and Ian Pulter in the doubles and returned later to defeat Pulter and Rory McLaughroy in the 4&3 in the fours, but lost the initial two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did a certain team recover from a lack of four points in an individual game, although as title holders, Furrick's team had enough of an equal result to keep the trophy.
After the second two days, however, the Sunday counterattack seems to remain on top of them.
North Korea Says 'No Chance' to Disarm Unilaterally Without Confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that prolonged sanctions deepened distrust in the United States and there was no chance the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear missile tests, dismantling nuclear test sites and committing itself against the proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see an appropriate response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to accessing nuclear disarmament “in stages,” according to which North Korea would be gradually rewarded for the steps taken, his statement seemed significant because he did not reject unilateral, nuclear disarmament, without discussion, as Pyongyang has done.
Ree alluded to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit in general of the current US president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula” while Trump gave a guarantee of North Korea’s security.
North Korea demands a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insists Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refuses to yield to tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first and foremost' and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a vain dream for people who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the existing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other side of this nuclear disarmament issue, instead of the United States, nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula would not have ended in such a dead end.”
However, Ri’s tone of speech was significantly different from last year’s when he told the U.N. General Assembly that directing North Korean missiles to the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile” on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much remained to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn’t have a timeframe for that, saying “whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "Security Council sanctions must continue fully and without exception until complete, definitive nuclear disarmament is confirmed."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to obstruct funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last time did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July with a statement that progress had been made, but was denied by North Korea only a few hours later because of "gangster demands".
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to disarm a missile plant and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him the “appropriate measures” he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump gave in Singapore, as well as moves to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University this year aims to teach all graduates more sleep in order to combat the growing macho-culture of learning by staying up all night with the help of caffeine.
One researcher found that students at the world’s leading university often don’t know anything when it comes to basic self-care.
Charles Chaizler, a professor of dream medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a speech about the impact of insufficient sleep on learning.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this now, in the last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help in academic and athletic performance, while also improving overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of health services at the university, said the university had decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a serious lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one part, there is a picture of a dormitory where students press on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how not enough sleep affects athletic performance and the importance of bedtime routine.
In another section, participants learn about how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, depression and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as you have a right to know about the health effects when you choose to smoke a cigarette.”
The culture of pride in “working all night” still exists, he said, and besides, modern technology and increasing pressure on students mean that lack of sleep is a growing problem.
Having enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" in the fight against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid obesity, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, which makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sow, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaizler design the course after attending one of his classes last year, in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to act for a course throughout the student city.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar program before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Chaizler recommended that students consider setting an alarm about when to go to bed, and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted from electronic screens and LED light, which displaces the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Manga knocked down Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another devastating, sad day when Dolly Menga's strike sent the disillusioned team of Steven Gerrard in a 1-0 loss to Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to register their first win after the February 4–1 triumph at St. Johnston, but Gary Holt's team inflicted a second loss on Gerard's team in 18 games as manager, leaving their team eight points behind the runaway lead team Harts in the Scottish First League.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time and Rangers' line-up lost inspiration and chances of leveling.
Now the Rangers fell to sixth place, and Livingston climbed to third and are only behind Hibernian according to the difference in goals.
There may be additional problems waiting for Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after he was apparently hit by a distant object.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that passed Aer in the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same 11 Livingstones who scored a point with Harts last week and would have been happy with the way his well-trained stance stifled opponents at every chance.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
They were supposed to score a point, two minutes after Menga's first playoff kicked Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed the chance.
Then a long-range strike by Keehan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow could only play openly in defense.
The Rangers managed to control the game, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should receive a penalty in the fifteenth minute when he and Steven Lawles clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson did not give a sign of approval of the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly failed to score from Lasana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovi Edaria's weak shot.
Although the start of the 34th minute of Livingston may have been the opposite of the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved their game.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with the Jacobs blow.
Scott Alfred did not react when Declan Gallagher added the ball to Scott Robinson, who with a cold head chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerard reacted during the half-time when he replaced Kulabali with Ryan Kent, and the replacement had a quick impact when the winged player passed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly reacted from his line with a blockade.
But Livingston managed to attract guest players to play a type of game they enjoyed, with Litgow and Hackett grabbing many of the long additions.
Holt's team could have extended the lead towards the end of the game, but McGregor set up well and prevented Jacobs from playing head-to-head.
Rangers' replacement, Glen Middleton had another penalty claim after colliding with Jacobs, but Thomson again declined.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now one side of our Sunday Morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE DEFINE... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, a discovery that led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become a major pillar of science and popular culture, as in the 1950 film The Bells of Colorado, starring the seemingly inconceivable, cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What's that again?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can hear the effects of the atoms releasing the radioactivity into the minerals.”
Evans: "Say it, it's probably jumping now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the discovery that bears his name still exists.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to 'Look' at Stuck Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Stuck Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize stunted cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in a laboratory.
You can “see” protein common in many types of cancer, and then be returned to the body
The trial vaccine gives promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
In a woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize stunted cells, ovarian cancer disappeared in 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory, so that they can “see” a protein common in many cancers called HER2, and then returning them to the body.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that promises a lot.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast cancer, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach by extracting immune cells from patients and “learning” them how to target cancer cells works in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West made a pro-Trump outburst, wearing a cap with his motto, after a live performance on Saturday night.
That didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio during a live show on Saturday night, following a useless performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing a third song that night called Ghost Town, which wore a cap that read “Make America Famous Again,” he began criticizing Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“Often when I talk to a white man, they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have emigrated from America long ago," he said.
The Saturday night live show began with a satire with Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Bret Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee related to allegations of sexual assault on Christine Blacy Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West's outburst was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear whether Rock was trying to ridicule West with the announcement.
West also complained to the audience that he had struggled behind the scenes because of his cap.
“I was laughed at behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't show up with that cap."
They made fun of me!
Then they told me I was in a sunken place, he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West went on: “Do you want to see the sunken place?” said he would “put his superman-drop on, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments drew outrage from the audience at least twice, and the crew of the evening show looked embarrassed, Varajeti reported, one man told the publisher: “The whole studio sucks.”
West was brought in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with a performance of the song "I Love It", dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPSAD, Candice Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "For one of the bravest ghosts: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING TO THE Crowd".
But show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was his own and that's absolutely wonderful."
But I chose NOT to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who I believe accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“So do we,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, with him now "formally known as Keane West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows the footsteps of Didi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puff and P Didi.
Rapper colleague Snoop Dogg has the name Snoop Lyon and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Attempted murder at Belfast restaurant

The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as a skilled swordsman as John Snow in the violent, medieval, fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, attacked the macho-hero stereotype when he stated that such on-screen roles meant that young boys often felt that they had to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times culture section, Keith said he believes "something is wrong" and wonders how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #NowI'm saying.
Keith, who recently married Game of Thrones star Rosie Leslie, also 31, has admitted to having "strong feelings" about the matter.
“Personally, I have strong feelings, at the moment – where did we go wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What do we teach men when they grow up about the problems we see now?”
Keith believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity, thanks to strong male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is taught?
What is learned from TV, and what on the street, that makes young boys feel that they must have a certain side of masculinity?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time — how do we change that?
“There’s something wrong with young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying he "ends with battles and horses".
As of November, Keith will be performing in Sam Sheppard's True West Restoration, the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks that meeting his wife Rose is the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so in a certain way she gave me my future family and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose played Igrit, a character who had a love interest in the character of Keith, John Snow, in the fantastic series that won Emmy Awards.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 are covered in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most new incidents have been transmitted through sex, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly across parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
But the number of people living with HIV has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000 people.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is high.
Because of the country’s conservative values, research shows that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will ever marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease are due to inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied data leaked by a staff member related to a Republican senator as “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three Republican senators in the United States on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat assured that the claims were on “ultra-right” sympathizers and websites.
"Lies, lies and even more disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home address and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unidentified person in Capitol Hill as the Senate hearing panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated as a Supreme Court judge, was held.
The information came shortly after Kavanaugh's interrogation by three senators.
Conservative sites such as Gatway Pandit and Redstate reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was linked to Waters' office and information about a member of Waters' staff was released, Hill said.
“These unfortunate allegations are completely false and constitute an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my staff – whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these false and false accusations – is in no way responsible for the information presented.
Unhappy accusations are completely false and are an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“These denials are nervous,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It must not be challenged.
He must not question the motives of the accused.
He needs to stay calm and calm.”
Fletcher seems to have compared Waters's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was indicted by critics for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
“If it’s true, it’s a big deal,” he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant institutions and police of the false claims.
“We will allow the perpetrators to be identified,” she continued, “and that they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are harmful and dangerous to some and all of my staff members.”
Thinking of Johnny English Attacks Again – Undermining Rowan Atkinson’s Spy Scams
It is now traditional to look for Brexit elements in every new British-related film, and this seems to be the case for this renewal of the Johnny English franchise - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and repeated in 2011 with Johnny English: Reborn.
Will the careful self-assertion of the topic of how obvious we are for nowhere be the new export opportunity the nation has?
Despite all this, the face with big eyes and a lot of grimaces of incompetent Johnny English got a license to "cook" things for the second time - his name above all means that he is a comic creation with a wide scope, made for viewers in cinemas in places where English is not spoken.
He is, of course, a sketch of a secret agent who, despite his bizarre efforts for careful glamour, resembles Clouseau, has the features of Mr. Bean and part of the boy who plays a note from the song Coaches on Fire from the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is based on the traveler and mysterious international man Atkinson who once starred in Barclays' now-forgotten TV commercial, leaving chaos behind.
There are one or two moments in the latest edition of Johnny English.
I really liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor, and the fins of the rotor hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor seems weak and somehow superficial, especially since "serious" film brands such as 007 and Impossible Mission themselves contain elements of comedy.
Humor seems to be meant for kids instead of adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy accidents aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent stunts.
The problem is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker infiltrated a super-secret network of spies in Britain, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the disillusionment of the on-duty agent – a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
On the last chance for a prime minister who is a pompous and fighting figure and already suffers from a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thomson does her best in this character of quasi-Theresa May, but there is nothing special in the scenario to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that because every active spy is compromised, she will have to activate one of the retired ones.
And that means calling in Johnny English himself, who now works as a private school teacher, but “on the black” gives classes for secret agents: there are a few good guys here when English offers a school for spying that resembles a rock academy.
English is quickly summoned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with former collaborator Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Bow is now a married man, in a relationship with a submarine commander, a comic role in which Vicky Peperdin is not well used.
Well, Batman and Robin, for screwing up all the stuff in the Royal Secret Service, return to action and meet the fatally beautiful Ophelia Buletova, a character played by Olga Kirilenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the dangerous influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the evil Jason Walta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their odyssey of absurd actions: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they make a desolation after smuggling themselves on Volta's luxury yacht; and English begins a real anarchy when he tries to use a helmet for virtual reality.
All the brakes are removed for the last sequence, but as kind and noisy as it is, there is a lot of children's TV in the whole movie.
Nice, moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give him the role of Rowan Atkinson to use his talent?
Labour denies they have a plan to work four days a week but be paid for five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week - but be paid for five.
The party reportedly wants company bosses to take advantage of the savings they make with artificial intelligence to give workers another day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend — but would take the same pay.
According to the sources, the idea "fits" with the economic agenda of the party and with the plans of the country to be more favorable to the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changes in the economy.
A high-ranking party member told the Sunday Times: "The strategy revision should be announced before the end of the year.
"It won't happen overnight, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that is in line with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers, as well as the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labor Party will not be the first to embrace such an idea, the Green Party advocated a four-day work week during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, aspiration was not accepted by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day work week is not a party strategy and the party is not considering such an idea."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize the power of “directors without a face” and “profiteers” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not get the whole part back because the Labour government could make "deductions" due to unethical behavior.
He also confirmed plans for workers to become part of company boards and create Inclusive Property Funds, with 10 percent of the capital of private firms going to employees, who will be able to take an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
John F. Kennedy, Lindsay Graham, and 60 Minutes on whether the FBI’s investigation into Kavanaugh could reconsider
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week and updated the question of whether the bureau's findings could reconsider some Republican senators' withdrawal of support.
In an interview published on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I was going to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charges came out, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham's voice, however, seems to have been carved into stone.
"My decision has been made for Brett Kavanaugh and a shocking charge is needed," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett denies vigorously,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blacy Ford.
“Everyone I know can’t confirm it.
It's 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring famous stars and has an impressive mission; an end to poverty.
Now held for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will be visited by tens of thousands of people who will come to the big lawn in the central park, not only to enjoy performances by names like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the goal to the end.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international activist group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they want to pay for a VIP ticket), participants must complete several tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other useful deed that will help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is a Goblet Citizen because there are 12 years left to achieve the whole thing?
Is the idea of a free concert a real way to convince people to ask to do something, or just another case of click-activism – people who feel they are making a real difference by signing a petition online or sending a message on Twitter?
As of 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “activities” from supporters, which acted for many different purposes.
They say these activities have helped inspire world leaders to announce commitments and strategies that have raised more than $37 billion and will impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 promises and announcements resulting from their activities, of which $10 billion had already been sent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key pledges are the UK-based Power of Food, a partnership of investors and implementers dedicated to “helping children tap into their potential,” which has pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help with the country’s malnutrition after receiving 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a record in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ullman of the Food Powers told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said more than 5,000 activities have been undertaken related to calls to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in Britain, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website, “Why do you think you can put an end to extreme poverty?”
A Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey – we will never succeed.
But like the great civil and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are some of the artists who will perform at this year's New York event, hosted by Deborah-Lee Furnes and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to Block Russia's Energy Exports - Interior Ministry
Washington could "use the Navy if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching the market, including the Middle East, U.S. Interior Minister Ryan Zinki said.
According to Zinki, Russia’s involvement in Syria – namely, where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government – is a screen for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because of energy trading, just as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And according to the government official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our navy, to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, blockade their energy to reach the market," he said.
Zinki addressed attendees at an event organized by the Alliance of Energy Consumers, a nonprofit group that presents itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He continued to compare Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that it is effectively the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to raise the stakes and replace the fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "inconvenient pony" with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statement came after the Trump administration launched a mission to boost liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord-Tek-2 pipeline should double the current capacity of the 110-billion-billion-cubic-metre pipeline, a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s firm opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that customers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was met with resistance from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States not to interfere in European energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third party interferes in our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" whether to run for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "carefully consider" whether to run for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting at the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our dysfunctional government, and that means a woman on the forehead,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will carefully consider whether to run for president.”
Warren assessed President Donald Trump’s work during a meeting in the city hall and said he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is open in her criticism of Trump and the man he nominates as Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a large number of voters in her constituency think she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Center for Political Research.
Thirty-two percent support such a nomination.
The poll showed more support for the nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential nomination and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known Democratic Party names discussed for the 2020 nomination are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trek Palin’s post-traumatic syndrome at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after signing up in September.
He was arrested and charged in an incident of domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son has been going through, what he has been going through since he came back, I know how other families who have been torn apart by the post-traumatic syndrome and the wounds our soldiers are returning to feel,” she told an audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "an elephant in the room" and said her son and other military veterans "are coming back a little different, they are coming back solid, they are coming back and wondering if there is respect for what they and their aviation comrades have given to the country, and every other member of the military has given it to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska and charged with domestic violence by assaulting a woman, along with a report of domestic violence and possession of alcohol-related weapons, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vasila Police.
18 states and the city of Washington support challenging the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the city of Washington support challenging a new U.S. policy that prevents the granting of asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
Representatives of 18 states and the city of Washington filed a petition with the court (amicus curiae) on Friday in Washington in support of an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Parliament case, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and violent members of his gang" abused her, but the U.S. authorities rejected her asylum request on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
The state attorney representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a number of asylum claims in the United States originated, as nations with persistent gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturns a 2014 ruling by the Immigration Complaints Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Washington, D.C. Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of lawmaking at the federal, federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires that all asylum requests be adapted to certain facts and circumstances of the request, and such a provision violates that principle,” according to the petition to the court (amicus curiae).
In addition, defenders in the letter argue that the policy that prevents the entry of immigrants is harmful to the U.S. economy because they are more likely to become entrepreneurs "to offer the necessary labor force".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
"There is asylum for those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum has never been conceived as a solution to all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue efforts are underway in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is incredibly serious.
"It's very tense," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she was comforting her male baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances carry bodies.
“There is no clean water.”
Residents return to their ruined homes and choose from their irrigated objects to save something they can.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dui Harris, who has fractures on his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outside for frequent subsequent minor earthquakes.
Tears came to his eyes as he described the powerful earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor in which he was with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was pressed into the ruins of the wall, I think,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and the kid.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Beating” with “Propaganda Ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American daily listing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. media to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke on Wednesday about China Daily's paid allowance in the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, China dismissed the accusation.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise on trade promotion, Beijing and Washington are currently in a trade war in which tariffs are leveled against each other.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have confirmed.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing was hurting U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register, “now doubles the harassment of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In de-seminating propaganda, the Chinese government is abusing the cherished American tradition of free speech and free media by placing advertisements in the De Moin Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Conversely, in a nearby newspaper stand, here in Beijing, you can only find a limited number of opinions and you will not see a real reflection of the desperate opinions that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economic trajectory, because the media is controlled by the hard-line Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most read newspapers in China rejected his offer to publish" on the column, although he did not say which newspaper was in question.
Republicans move away from women's votes ahead of midterm elections over debacle with Kavanaugh, analysts warn
Because many Republicans are silently watching or defending Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Supreme Court despite several allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that there will be negative consequences, especially for women in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case are extremely strong, and most Republicans have already said they want to continue voting.
From such things there is no going back,” wrote Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell faculty at the University of Syracuse, about Hill, in a column published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that pressure from the FBI to investigate Senator Jeff Flake (Republican from Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow, nor in November," said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive group MoveOn, on Friday, ahead of Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" in a protest in the Senate hallway, when Republicans, who have control of the legal committee, decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, Mick said.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be high," Stu Rotenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People are already saying that they are tall; that’s true.
But they can be higher, especially among independent female voters in the suburbs and young voters aged 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even ahead of Ford’s public testimony detailing her accusations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court judge, analysts suggest that there could be negative consequences if Republicans continue to vote.
"This has become a big mess for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting in the committee or the last vote or whether Kavanaugh will go to the hearing, it’s also about how Republicans deal with this and how they treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps select Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans are divided on who to trust after Ford and Cavanaugh testimonies, although a larger number accept the first-mentioned side.
A new survey by Yu-Gov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe in Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh was probably or definitely lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent thought the same about Ford.
Following Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one more, by Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had drunkenly assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez accuses the Supreme Court judge of showing her genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup business that claims to be a rival to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the legend in technology, Inrapt, is a company that is built on the open source platform Solid, by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data will be stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent was "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he told the start-up business.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "online data warehouse" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available on one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal storage of data on the Internet is that it is only up to the user who has access to a certain type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea behind Inrapt, according to company CEO John Bruce, is for the company to provide resources, process, and appropriate skills for Solid to be accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several development developers with a project contract and a community of coding volunteers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrapt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where their business models are completely turned upside down overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a press release released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrapt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of a new network built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the Consortium of the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Recently, Berners-Lee has been an influential spokesperson in the debate on net neutrality.
Even with Inrapt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m a big optimist for the new era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Famous Victorian Cross of the First World War
The only priest of the Church of England who received the Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been celebrated in his hometown for 100 years.
Colonel, Honorable Bernard Van received recognition on 29 September 1918 in an attack on Belenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never found out he had received the highest British military decoration.
A commemorative stone was discovered by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was an "incredible symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Van led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "Out of very dense fog and under heavy fire from cannons and machine guns".
He later ran to where he was shot and with "the greatest courage" led him forward, before attacking a cannon's nest and disabling three of the servers.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – almost a month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s works were “something I know I’ll never be able to fulfill, but it’s something that makes us humble.”
He and his brother Dr. James Van also laid a wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band.
Michael Van said it was "a great honor to be part of the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of combined martial arts stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead they got Pepa Pig
Imagine waking up all night to watch Bellator 206 and not having the opportunity to watch the main event.
The San Jose list contained 13 fights, including six with the main card being shown live all night in Britain on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gerard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, spectators in Britain were horrified when the canal switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not impressed after staying awake until the early hours because of the struggle.
One Twitter fan described the switching of a children's cartoon file as "some kind of painful joke".
"The law is such that at 6 a.m. that content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepa Pig, yes."
Bellator CEO Scott Kuker said they would work on a schedule that would include spectators from Britain in the future.
“I think when I think about relaunching, I think we can probably find a solution,” Kuker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we won’t be able to find a solution on Sunday after our time, and Monday after their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, we received a lot of messages during the transfer, and none of them were favored.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn't, it was a legal issue.
I can promise you it won't happen again.
We will limit the number to five fights, instead of six – as we usually do – we tried to deliver more because of the fans and we overreacted.
It's an unfortunate situation.
Discs on a deserted island: Tom Daley felt “inferior” because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on Radio 4’s first show, Discs on a Desert Island, presented by Laurent Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a parent made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running Kirsty Young show took months off due to illness.
Appearing as a supporting character in Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "less" than everyone else as he grew up because "it was not socially acceptable to have sympathy for boys and girls."
He said: “Until this day, those feelings of inferiority and diversity have been the things that gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-bronze medal-winning Olympian became a prominent supporter of LGBT campaigns and used his performance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke publicly because he felt happy to be able to live openly without division and to give “hope” to others.
The three-time world champion said about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met him in 2013 - "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years old, last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at an early age" - he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and depths.
The two became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and the Daily said "all his views" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it was all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't agree to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be here to be in the front row,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and when he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he was invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I’d dreamed of all my life – jumping in front of a domestic audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Pride by Heather Small - which went through his head in preparation for the Olympics and which he still cherished.
Discs on a desert island on BBC Radio 4 are on Sunday at 11:15 AM UK summer time.
Michelson, the horse is out of shape, was on the bench during the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays in the 47th game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to change shape to avoid an unfortunate turnaround.
Michelson, who plays at the biennial event for the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furrick during Saturday's doubles and fours.
Instead of being the center of attention, as the five-time winner often represents the United States, he divided the time to cheer and practice on his game, on the range, hoping to fix what was quiet.
He has never been the best leader, not even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old is not an ideal choice for the tight field of Le Golf National, where far-flung bruises are a regular punishment at inattention.
And if the pitch itself is not intimidating enough, Michelson, in the ninth game of the week, faces precision champion of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who plays in a pair with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are missing four points before 12 individual matches, start hard, the game of Michelson can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his man, not that he could see anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, touched me on the back and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is part of the celebrity and has given a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I had no idea he was playing two games.
I was thinking more, but it happened, and we thought we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else.”
Michelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for most games played at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
It could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, where he never achieved the best results in his individual career.
Michelson has 18 wins, 20 lost matches and seven halves, although Furick said his presence brings something intangible to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s insightful, he wants to make jokes with people and he’s a great guy at team meetings.”
“I think the younger players had fun playing with him, like this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead ahead of individual competitions on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable position.
The Dane made his debut at a game in Valderama in 1997, when the guy led by Steve Balesteros had a lead of five points ahead of the Americans, but "had crossed the finish line only with the noses", with the lowest lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"I remind myself that we had a great lead in Valderama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn when we lost and in Valderama when we almost won," Björn said, pictorially, after watching the 2018 class win 5-3 on Friday and yesterday with a 10-6 lead at Le Golf National.
Well, history will show me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Get ready for tomorrow.
Go out and play well.
This is not over as long as the game lasts.
We have a goal, which is to try to win the trophy and the focus remains on that.
“I’ve been saying all along, I’m focusing on 12 players on our team, but we’re fully aware of the opposing side – the best players in the world.”
Björn added: "I don't want to make premature judgments on this issue.
Tomorrow's game is a different beast.
We’re looking forward to the individual games tomorrow, and that’s a different thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when things go well, but when you play individually, then you test all abilities as a golfer.
That’s the message we need to send to the players, to do their best tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner and he has to do his best.”
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furrick will require players to play better individually than they did in doubles, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the changes on the last day, as he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the Miracle in Medina.
"I remember every word there," he said when asked about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought the players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to start like the last start we saw in Brooklyn, as we saw in Medina.
When the momentum moves in a certain direction, it brings a lot of pressure to the middle matches.
We set the line accordingly and the order of the team is according to how we feel, you know, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas is given the task of opposing first and facing Rory McClelroy in the most important match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ramm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter with other Europeans in the most important half of the order.
"I've decided to play this way with the guys because I think that's how we're going to cover everything," Björn said of the selection in the individual games.
New German Navy Ship Delayed Again
The German Navy’s latest frigate was due to be delivered in 2014 to replace Cold War-era antiquated warships, but it won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rising prices, local media reported.
The delivery of the Rheinland-Falz, the flagship of the new class of Baden-Wittemberg frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Di Zeit, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but problematic issues after delivery hampered the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wittemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will be a replacement for the obsolete Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will contain a powerful cannon, a large number of anti-aircraft weapons and naval missiles, as well as some stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic trace.
Among other important features is less maintenance - it should be possible, the latest frigates, to be absent for up to two years from domestic ports.
However, the constant delays mean that modern warships – which should allow Germany to have power across the oceans – will be obsolete by the time they enter service.
The frigate with the unfortunate fate of the F125 reached the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to receive the ship and returned it to the Blom and Vos shipyards in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of key "software and hardware defects" that made the warship useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wittemberg-class ships would have a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the crew of the older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was drastically above the planned weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add upgrades in the future.
The Rhineland-Palatinate weighs 7,000 tons and is believed to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to problematic hardware, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
It is said to have reached an incredible <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – an increase from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems facing the latest frigates are particularly important because of warnings of Germany's reduced naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence commission of the German parliament, confirmed that the navy is "lacking ships that can be deployed".
The representative said the problem has worsened over time, as old ships have been withdrawn from service, but no replacement ships have been provided.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wittemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new property survey is underway in Scotland’s mountainous regions to find out how bats use the area in their search for food.
There is hope that the findings will provide answers to the behavior of unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano bats, as well as long-eared brown bats and daubenton bats at Inverrow Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special shooters will be placed in key locations around the property to monitor bat activity during the season.
N.H.S. personnel and volunteers will also carry mobile research using handheld detectors.
Expert analyses of sounds from all recordings will determine the frequency depending on the type of bats.
Then a map of the habitats will be drawn up to create a detailed picture of their behavior in the area.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser at N.T.S., hopes the results will reveal which areas of life are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and how best to maintain forests for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and Britain has declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development that affect beds and habitat loss.
Windmills and lights also pose a risk, as do fly adhesive tapes and some chemical treatments for building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to their hunting habits at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to find insects and obstacles in the flight path.
N.T.S., which cares for more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the state, takes bats very seriously.
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, bed inspections, and sometimes rescues.
The organization even established the first and only bat reserve in Scotland on the Triv estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten species that live in Scotland.
Property manager David Thomson says the property is ideal territory for them.
"We have a great area for bats here in Triv," he said.
“We have old buildings, very old two and very good living quarters.
But there are a lot of unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us learn more about what they need to thrive.”
He stressed that it is important to check if there are bats before property renovations are carried out because the unconscious destruction of litters can destroy up to 400 females and cubs, and destroy the entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, torture or disturb or destroy their beds.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish clerk at the Bat Protection Trust, encourages the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and our other species, we just don’t know how they live.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations "fake news," adding that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The assailant of Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then paid her $375,000 to avoid talking about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to its 142 million followers, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, dismissed the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was presented today is fake news," the five-time gold-ball winner said in front of his camera.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous by mentioning my name, but that’s part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, laughing.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they called "inadmissible transfer of suspicions from private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would seek damages for “moral damage in addition to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offense, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to documents filed with the court in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a "99 percent" "good boy", but dropped below that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that they had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claimed she went to the police and took pictures of her injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to a non-judicial settlement because she feared retaliation and was concerned "that she would be publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to renegotiate the deal because she has been traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack occurred and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain 'will always regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain will “always regret” if it loses its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said on Monday.
He added that it was "concerning" that Toyota-Britain told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at a plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border lockdowns in the event of a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The plant in Burnaston – which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be a cessation of production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concern about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal, including Honda, Be-M-We and Jaguar Land Rover.
Be-M-We, for example, says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what car manufacturers call the risks of the logistics chain in the case of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” system, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU, for cars as ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a border break that industry says could cause delays and gaps in parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to store more than a daily supply of inventory at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We need to have the best deal that will allow us not only to succeed in the present, but to seize this opportunity," he told the BBC's Radio 4 program today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what is a very successful set of logistics chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and cost jobs.
Peter Cuvalaris, who has been working at Burnston for 24 years and is a union representative at the factory, said that its members are becoming increasingly concerned: “According to my experience, once those jobs are gone, they will never return.
According to a government spokesman, "We have drawn up a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight over Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination for Supreme Court justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential violations of the president’s laws.
Whether Trump sacked the deputy attorney general would jeopardize Miller’s independence has fueled gossip in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was considering wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But with the release of the reports last Monday, he went to the White House with the intention of resigning.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was scheduled for Thursday because he was at the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Cavanaugh and one of the women accused of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump issued an order to conduct a week-long FBI investigation into the lawsuits against Kavanaugh, which would further delay the Senate vote.
Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "The date for the meeting has not yet been set, it could be held this week, and it could be postponed for another week, given all the things that are happening in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see how things go and I always try to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute the claim that Sanders has not held a press briefing at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the small number of briefings were not due to dislike of the "great influence" of television journalists, although he added: "I will agree with the fact that they have a great influence."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president has organized more question and answer sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We've looked at those numbers."
“There will still be briefings,” Sanders said, “but if the press has the opportunity to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do it more often, and you are witnessing that we have done it repeatedly over the past few weeks, and talks with the President of the United States will replace press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences when visiting senior officials.
He rarely participates in independent press conferences.
This week in New York, the president may have shown why this is so with his uncontrollable and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled journalists.
Secretary of Health in a letter to EU workers working in Scotland’s national health system on Brexit-related fears
The health secretary wrote a letter to EU workers working in Scotland's national health system expressing his gratitude to the country and his desire to keep them after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter less than six months before the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the costs of resolved status applications for EU citizens working in lower-level public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “The UK-EU withdrawal negotiations continued throughout the summer, with the aim of making the expected decisions this fall.
But the UK government has also intensified preparations for the possibility of a no-deal deal.
I know this period is very disturbing for all of you.
That is why I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the workforce, regardless of his citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond share valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and are of value to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christian Abercrombie, a defensive linebacker at the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury at the game on Saturday when the team lost 31–27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before half-time.
"He came to the sidelines of the playground and just crashed to the ground," Reid said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen outside the playground, then put him in a stretcher and took him to further evaluation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at the Wanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/degree of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury actually occurred.
Abecrombi is a second-year student and plays his first season in a red jersey at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He made a total of five knockouts on Saturday before leaving the game, resulting in a total of 18 knockouts this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK
Under Tory's new plans, foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help homeless people.
The move will neutralize Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters.
A higher administrative fee will be imposed on those who do not pay tax in the UK
The ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year, funds to be used to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher administrative fee when buying property in the UK, and these additional funds will be used to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s attempt to attract young voters with his promises to provide affordable housing and focus on high-earning individuals.
The higher administrative fee will be imposed on individuals and companies that do not pay tax in the United Kingdom, with additional funds to strengthen the efforts of the Government to improve the situation with homeless people.
The additional amount that, in addition to the current administrative fee, includes the higher levels that were introduced two years ago for a second home and the purchase of property with the intention of renting it can reach up to three percent.
The ministry expects the move to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120m a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by non-UK residents, which has led to price hikes and made it difficult for people buying property to get involved in this process for the first time.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after Boris Johnson asked for a reduction in the administrative fee to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of offering high property prices that keep the land but do not use it, and asked Mrs May to change quotas for access homes in order to remedy the "shameful housing situation" in Britain.
Mr Corbyn announced a series of attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give the councils greater authority to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means repairing our disrupted housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies to be able to buy homes in the same easy way as valuable British residents.
The dream of owning one’s own home for many people has become too distant, and the humiliation of homeless people is too real.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate ambition is to run Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, said his "ultimate ambition" is to become the manager of Scotland's national club in the future.
The Scottishman, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the club in the northeast, which is currently in third place in the first league with just three points less than the club at the top.
This summer he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it," Ross told the Scottish Sportssound on BBC.
“But I grew up constantly watching Scotland at Hampden with my father and there was always something pulling me back.
However, I could only get such an opportunity if I was successful in managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as the manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardice, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he felt no anxiety knowing he needed to follow such established names at such a big club after he had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“My success at the moment is being judged by ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
Given the structure and facilities of this club, he undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get this club there, but I’ll probably think I’ve achieved success here only if I bring the club back there.”
Ross worked as a manager for just three years, entering a career after working as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and after a 15-month engagement as part of Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and brought back St. Mirren from the brink of losing the championship title in the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads for me,” he recalls taking over Alloa.
“I truly believed that a career as a manager was the right choice for me, a better choice than a career as a player.
It sounds strange because it worked well for me, I made enough money from it, and I enjoyed certain high privileges.
But building a career as a player can be really hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through on a weekly basis.
I still go through certain things in terms of stress and pressure from work, but I just feel good in my managerial role.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, in this role I feel more comfortable than ever in my entire adult life.”

According to one study, the perfect time for beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in profits for British pubs, which are currently in a very difficult situation, but has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The figures show pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s business consultancy firm, said: “Sunshine weather and longer than England’s expected participation in the World Cup meant that the situation in July was similar to that in June, when the profit of pubs increased by 2.8 percent and restaurants decreased significantly.
The fall in sales of 1.8 percent of restaurants in June worsened further in July.
Pubs and bars selling mostly beverages saw a much higher increase compared to previous years, compared to restaurants where a decline was observed.
Pubs that mostly sell food were also badly affected by the sunny periods, though not as dramatically as restaurant owners.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In successful pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and food sales by just three percent.
Paul Newman, a holiday and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results follow the trend we saw at the end of April.
The timing and impact of major social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling the market outside the home.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to be in a difficult situation, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales over a period of one year will be particularly devastating in addition to the current cost-driven pressures.
The long warm summer could not come at a worse time for the owners of locals where food is mostly sold and the weather will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August will provide much needed rest."
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a stalemate in the release of new brands.
The UK’s Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracker for pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with combined revenues of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is an established benchmark for the industry.
One in five children has a secret social media profile that they hide from their parents.
One study found that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have a secret social media profile that hides it from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” profile that they show to their parents.
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create a social media profile that hides it from adults.
The survey, which involved 20,000 high school students, showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” profiles, an abbreviation for the Instagram website where photos are shared.
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being posted on such profiles.
Twenty percent of students said they had cleared a “main” profile that they showed to their parents, and they also had other private profiles.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret profile met a teenager who asked others to “rape him.”
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted that one of them was a secret.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: “It’s really disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online profiles where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Elid Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the board of “Scottish Athletics”
Eleed Doyle was elected non-executive director of the board of Scottish Athletics at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland and President Ian Beatty described the move as an excellent opportunity for those who are part of the sport’s leadership to take advantage of her extensive international experience gained over the past decade.
"Everyone in the Scottish, British and global athletics community has a huge respect for Elid and we are confident that the athletes in Scotland would have a huge benefit if she became a member of the board," he said.
Doyle said: "I am ready to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland."
The American who won the 200m and 400m titles at the 1996 Atlanta Games, in addition to winning a total of four Olympic gold medals and who now appears regularly as a commentator on the BBC, was unable to go after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
The whole process was painstaking, but I managed to fully recover, I can go again and do agility exercises!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!”
Breast pump ad in which mothers are compared to cows has caused a division of opinion on the Internet
A breast pump company has sparked a division of opinion online when it published an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of the product, which is said to be “the world’s smartest breast pump,” the user-centric technology company Elvie has released a funny ad inspired by music videos to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four mothers dance in a cow barn full of hay on a song that reads: "Yes, I milk, but you don't see a tail" and "If you haven't noticed these are not names, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues: “Pump, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, lubricate my chest.”
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked controversy on the internet.
With 77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a really bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
“They, like us, need to get pregnant and give birth so they can produce milk, except that their children are being stolen from them just days after they have given birth.”
Elvie's breast pump fits discreetly into the breastfeeding bra ("Elvie"/"Mother")
Another comment reads as follows: “It is understandable that this is traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their babies?"
Someone else added, “Really inappropriate advertising.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she thought the song was really "ridiculous."
“I think this idea is genius.
I'd buy a pump like this if I was still breastfeeding.
It made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I think it's honest.
“It’s a great product,” one of the comments said.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial designed for mothers who milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women discover that they were dancing while discrete pumps were stuffed into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who use milk pumps say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no wires, no pipes, and discreetly fits into the breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies, and even get out of the house while milking.
Anna Balarin, a partner and DDR in Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is a truly revolutionary product and deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By setting a parallel between milk-sweeping women and dairy cows, we wanted milk-sweeping with a pump and the challenges it brings to the spotlight, while showing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings in a fun and closer way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has been present in all titles.
During a fashion week in London, a mother of two appeared on the fashion runway for designer Martha Jakubowski carrying the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children in detention has increased significantly, although border crossings on a monthly basis have remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the fact that harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors themselves were undocumented immigrants and feared endangering their own stay in the country if they asked to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs official, testified to Congress last week that the agency arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of individuals who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegally residing in the country and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal record.
That’s why we continue to pursue those individuals,” Mr. Albens said.
In order to process cases with children faster, authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than within 60 days, as shelter workers say the previous standard was.
Many of them will appear via a conference video call, rather than in person, in order to bring their case for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, shelter workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months said.
Lawyers say such problems have increased in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where its size makes it more likely that signs that the child is facing difficulties are being ignored.
They added that moving children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could increase the trauma that most of them are already facing.
Syria has told U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to immediately withdraw
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Muallem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally residing in Syria under the pretext of participating in the fight against terrorism and that "they will be treated accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and without setting conditions," he told the assembly.
Muallem insisted that the "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been evicted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "lead this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories" from the two terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised by both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of the country destroyed by the war.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions were good for them to return and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing the issue, which should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be provided with reconstruction aid until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for progress in political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who "will be eradicated."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a more constitutional constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned of the consequences of further interference in the committee.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump will again win the 2020 election unless impeachment and scandal prematurely terminate his presidency, as many liberals are likely to hope.
In what will no doubt be “The most dramatic presidential finale ever seen!”
As of now, there are no signs of fatigue in the viewers.
Since 2014, the strike time rating has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Nielsen says Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in strike time, 1.7 million more than four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC reached the top cable rating with about 3.5 million viewers in the evenings when important news is reported.
“This is like a fire that people feel drawn to because this is not something we understand,” said Neil Baer, chief television producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” for the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol was destroyed by an attack.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
She asked why.
“He replied, ‘Because I think he’s really funny,’” Ms. Skovell told me.
There’s a lot of fun going on in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming out of Washington can determine the future of the Roe vs. Wade case, whether immigrant families will be able to reunite, as well as the well-being of the global economy.
Exclusion from all this is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, you’re no longer an uninformed citizen when you’ve been watching a panel of experts debate the use of the “deep background” source by Bob Woodward for his $15,000 book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s leather bomber jacket (“clothes with thick arrogance,” as he called it “The Washington Post”).
I will never be able to see Super Mario in the same way.

When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and the temperature was 80 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked inside and watching MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He could not stop looking, at least not when Brett Cavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was in a critical state.

Inflow of external funds in the tightest midterm elections in the race for the Upper House
Not surprisingly, the 17th Congressional District of Pennsylvania receives a large amount of funding thanks to the reorganization of the congressional districts from which there are two candidates in the race for the same seat.
This recently reconstructed suburban area in Pittsburgh is run by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another area in the snap elections last spring.
Lamb competes with another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th congressional district, which largely overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The maps were modified after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old areas were being manipulated in favor of Republicans, contrary to the constitution.
The race in the new 17th Congressional District is a tough competition to fund campaigns between the party's main sponsors, the Democratic Party's Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party's National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the March 18th congressional district election, which was characterized by wide media coverage.
For more than a decade, the seat has been occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump has won the area with a margin of 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States decided to punish El Salvador for its support for China, and then gave up.
Diplomats said the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under little pressure from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," Heather Nauert, a State Department spokesman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But only in relation to El Salvador, penalties were taken into account, which received US aid of about $140 million in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have a detrimental impact on the country in Central America and high unemployment and homicide rates in the country.
As internal meetings progressed, representatives from North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity in order to hold a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading toward the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials said they wanted the conference to progress and effectively end any thinking about punishing El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is due to address a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the gathering, diplomats say.
The three U.S. officials also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing news of heavy messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal reflections on the state of anonymity.
Their views were supported by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke of the state of anonymity.
Learn the history
The next thing that could happen is the publication of a report by Special Counsel Robert Miller about a possible obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which there is currently very strong evidence in public records.
Mr. Miller is also reportedly directing his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign links to Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the composition of Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to bear responsibility in that body as he prepares to reappear before voters, and possibly before a jury composed of his colleagues.
There are a lot of uncertainties here, and I don’t want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable, not even his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make certain choices that will affect the duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed to do so and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history revolves around such points of change, and the unstoppable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several such points of change.
What do we do if Mr. Trump resigns Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Miller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in the hot seat since the newspaper reported that last year he proposed secretly filming the president and speculated that he was unfit for the office he was in.
Mr. Rosenstein says the information published in The Times is inaccurate.
“What will we do if the new investigation by Brett Cavanaugh requested by the F.B.I. is incomplete or unfair, or if he proves his innocence before the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And first of all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will blame Mr. Trump?
If we fail all these tests, democracy awaits a long winter.
But I don’t think that’s going to happen because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light candles for the Sabbath on a table with a swastika logo.
With such a legacy, how could I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorance of the Rangers is optimistic about the impact of Rapid Vienna.
The Rangers are hosting a clash with Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are aware of the fact that after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians will solidify their position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
Graham Dorens, a midfielder due to a knee injury, was prevented from appearing in the season until the 2–2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that score as a stepping stone to greater success.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good opponent," the 31-year-old said.
“We came into the game believing we could achieve something and came back with a point.
Maybe we could have given a little more in the end, but the unresolved result was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half and we did our best in the second half and we were better.
On Thursday, we have another big European night.
I hope we get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they had a good result in the last game, but I am sure that with the support of the fans we will return and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a difficult year given everything that happened, my injuries and changes at the club itself, but now there is some positive factor regarding the place.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that now we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success."
Women can’t sleep at night because of this fear related to retirement savings
Although the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don’t take the steps to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
Here's where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t share your desires with them ahead of time.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you can get care because such choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Include your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay those costs.
Your long-term care financing choices may include a traditional long-term care policy, a hybrid cash-based life insurance policy, which can help you cover costs or provide self-insurance with your own funds, if you have them.
Get your legal documents straight: Avoid legal battles right from the start.
Take out a health care authority so you can empower a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure health professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also, think about your financial resources.
In this way, you would choose a person of confidence to make financial decisions on your behalf and pay your bills if you are not able to do it yourself.
Do not forget the small details: Imagine that your older parent needs urgent medical care and is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the drugs he drinks and his allergies?
Note these details in writing to be prepared.

Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a flight.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and arm.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 BST (British summer time) as an "accidental act."
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to help.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to communications cuts, aid workers are unable to obtain information from Dongala County, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a county that stretches for more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) on the coast in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region within the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also an important activity in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Indonesia’s disaster relief agency says Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people off the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them residents of Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck an area near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami that reached up to 10 meters and destroyed dozens of villages, killing about 300 people.
2016: A shallow-focused earthquake hit the Pidhi Jaya district of Aceh, causing havoc and panic as it reminded people of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the earthquake did not cause a tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapsed buildings.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused thousands of tourists to be temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trek Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a report on domestic violence and opposing arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police officers.
According to a police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes, he took her phone.
Palin is at the Mat-Su detention facility with the possibility of leaving if he pays a sum of $500, KTUU reported.
On Saturday, he appeared in court, where he said he was "definitely innocent" when asked how he pleaded guilty, the network said.
Palin faces three class A offences, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B misdemeanor, a one-day prison sentence, and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called on police to report the alleged attack.
The case before the Veteran's Court in Alaska is ongoing.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, meddling in a domestic violence crime report, and possession of alcohol-related weapons in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he allegedly punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after she said her son’s violent behavior stemmed from PTSD, a consequence of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake struck an area near Central Sulawesi, northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for the beach festival in Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentence for suspect in New York terror attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifulo Saipov, a suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people, a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented Home Depot truck in October to attack a bike lane on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan and run over pedestrians and cyclists in his path.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to seek the death penalty delivered to the Southern District of New York.
According to court documents, it is possible to impose the death penalty on both of these grounds from the indictment.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Grand Jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering homicide, which is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
To carry out the attack required "detailed planning and intention," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out it as "gross, cruel and depraved."
"Sajfulo Habibulaevich Saipov caused, injured, harm and loss of the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Kleves, En-Lore Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliy, Hernan Ferucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuccio," the voice said.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since a death penalty case was prosecuted in New York’s Southern District.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of plotting to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both were sentenced to death by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police also said he had asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, instead of accepting a plea and to impose a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be in Charge of Brexit Negotiations
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a Tory party conference, vowed to "mobilize the people's army."
The former leader of the Ukip party said politicians must "feel the heat" from eurosceptics, with one of Theresa May's lawmakers suggesting he be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backer Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that the UK would have been "out of the EU" if Mr Farage had been secretary for Brexit.
But Mrs May's challenge to the reunification of her deeply divided members was highlighted by counter-Brexit members of the Tory party who joined a special protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is trying to continue implementing the Chequers plan despite attacks by pro-Brexit individuals, counter-Brexit individuals and the EU.
Allies insisted that she would continue trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite strong reactions and that she would force eurosceptics and Labour members to choose between her package and "chaos".
Mr. Bonn told the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to "reject the Checkers plan".
He suggested that Mr Farage should be involved and that he should be given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge of the negotiations, we would have been outside the EU by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we have to reject the Checkers plan."
Expressing his position against the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars until now to be subordinated.
We want to create our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bon rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely inaccurate.”
Andrea Jenkins, a member of the Tory and pro-Brexit party, also attended the march and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not well-received by the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not well-received by our party and our activists who are actually those who take to the streets and owe our victory to the elections.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening to us.”
In a targeted message to Ms May, she added: "Prime ministers retain their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage said politicians must "feel the heat" if they intend to hand over the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
“They’re trying to hand over Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them that we’re not going to let you get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that has enabled us to win Brexit and that will not stop until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, counter-Brexit individuals marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
After the group's rally, a small number of activists showed up this weekend carrying banners reading "The Tory vs. Brexit".
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, ridiculed conservatives on the security issues they faced at the opening of the conference regarding the party-created application.
“These are the people who tell us that they can set up IT systems and all the necessary technology for Canada plus, for a border without controls, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren Plans to Consider Candidacy for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would "think carefully about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Democratic representative from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a city hall in western Massachusetts this Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Jeff Deal, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was at the center of speculation that she could replace Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters since Trump took office, which uses the format of a city assembly.
One of the attendees asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes putting a woman on top.”
Suspect Arrested in Shooting and Death of LSU Basketball Player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting and death of basketball player Wade Sims of the LSU team on Friday had been arrested.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of Dieteon Simpson, 20, at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the east.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man from the video.
Simms, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday morning.
“Wade Sims had a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wade intervened to defend his friends and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being present at the crime scene, possessing a weapon, and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in the parish police department East Baton Rouge.
As a 192-cm-tall junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 appearances last season, an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 goals per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton closer to world title after team secures victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team's orders would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost left Hamilton on the strainer as he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered boxing first and let Hamilton fight the riot at the end of the group, something that was supposed to have a decisive role.
Mercedes entered the boxing one round later and came behind Vetel, but Hamilton went ahead after the one-on-one action that forced the Ferrari driver to inadvertently leave the interior at his own free risk of remaining on the side after the double move to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the net and ended in seventh place on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then led the majority of the race and steered the tires of his car to quickly reach the finish line and overtake Kimi Raikkonen, taking fourth place.
He eventually entered boxing in the 44th round, but could not raise the pace in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen came in fourth place.
“It’s a tough day today because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me go.
The team made a really exceptional decision to have their own pair in the race," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she had not released a letter from Christine Blasy Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "naughty and naughty and dishonest."
"There is only one thing that can happen, and the wonderful thing is that in what has been happening in the last few days in the Senate, you can see anger, people who are angry and vicious and reckless and insincere," he said.
“When you see posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, did you publish this information?
Do you remember her answer... did you publish the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Wait a minute then.
Did we publish it... No, we did not publish it," he added, imitating the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein regarding the allegations against Cavanaugh by Ford back in July, and they were released in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t publish her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep them confidential and I did what she asked.”
But the president did not seem to believe her denial, so he commented on the same at a rally on Saturday: “I’ll tell you one thing, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t do it, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual abuse by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to restore power in any way.
You can see their wickedness, their meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample on to regain their power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in the match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars compensated for the loss of the Elite League match on Friday against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5–3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants gained an advantage from two goals scored by Patrick Dwyer and Frances Bovillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney scored an advantage for the host over Dwyer to take back the lead of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory with his two goals.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's boys, who reciprocated with a 2–1 win over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two sides of the season, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
The chance for Dwyer came in the fourth minute, namely at 3:35 with the addition of Kendall McFaul, which was added by David Rutherford while Bovillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
This was a quick opening of the match, Sullivan secured the host's lead with 13:10, before Matt Merkart assists Kauni to score 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the lead until the first break, when he scored the second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The host regrouped and Bushard returned them again with a powerful game and a goal, with the result being 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead in the match for the first time late in the second period and he secured his team's victory halfway through the final period of the fifth game.
The Giants, who lost in four of their last five games, will play their next match on Friday at home in Milton Keynes.
A flight controller has died helping hundreds of people on board to escape an earthquake.
A flight controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero since he died helping a plane with hundreds of people safely take off.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a major earthquake struck Sulawesi island on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to ravage the area, with many stranded in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues escaping to save their own lives, the 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufre airport in Palu, which was constantly swaying.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air's flight number 6321, which was at the time on the runway, would take off safely.
Then he jumped off the control tower the moment he thought the tower was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter got to Palu.
"This news has broken our hearts," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, and the disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"It is believed that the death toll is increasing because many bodies are still under the rubble, while many cannot even be accessed," Sutopo spokesman Purvo Nugroho said.
Waves reaching up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft carry aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Emergency assistance carries bodies every minute.
There is not enough clean water.
“Mini-markets are being robbed everywhere.”
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse.”
Indonesian President Yoko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” he wrote on CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini Says One Man Disappeared After Plane Crash In Lagoon
The airline, which operated the plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean lagoon in Micronesia, said one person had disappeared after previously saying 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to find the male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try and find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident, as well as the exact order of events, remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane crashed into a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane was flying very low.
"It's a very good thing," Janes said.
Janes said he and others were able to cross the water reaching halfway and head for the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near the port's reconstruction also helped rescue the ship, taking people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the aviation safety network shows that 111 people have died in accidents at airlines registered in the PNG over the past two decades, but none of them included the airline Air Niugini.
An analyst has determined the time frame of the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended up presenting the case on Saturday for the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He said the jury used phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location data from several mobile phones showing that Telis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was questioned on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Telis was telling the truth by saying he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Telis said he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telis deleted the messages and calls from Chambers, as well as her contact information, from her phone.
"He erased it from his life," Hale said.
The defense is due to present its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to decide the case later that day.
“The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to refute the negative view of the genre by including positive messages in their music.
Bristol's The High Breed argues that hip-hop has drifted away from its origins as political-message music that aims to solve societal problems.
They want to go back to its roots and re-popularize conscientious hip-hop.
Artists such as "The Fugees" and "Common" have recently experienced their revival through artists such as "Akala" and "Lowkey".
Another black woman?
New York nanny sues married couple for being fired after sending ‘racist’ message
A New York City nanny sues a married couple for being fired on grounds of discrimination after mistakenly receiving a message from her mother complaining about the fact that she was "another black woman."
The couple denies being racist, saying the lawsuit is actually "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, was disappointed when in 2016 after the first day of work of the new caregiver Giselle Morris found out that she was a black woman.
“NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris, twice.
After realizing what Plasco-Flexman had actually done, she felt "uncomfortable" she fired Mrs. Morris, saying that their friendly nanny, who is African-American, was doing a poor job and that instead she expected the nanny to be from the Philippines, The New York Post reported.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her first day of work and then sent home to Uber.
Morris is now suing the couple and seeking compensation for the $350-a-day redundancy over a six-month period, an engagement that would involve her living with her family, what she was originally hired to do, but without a contract.
"I want to show them that such things should not be done," she told Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple responded to the lawsuits that they were racist, saying the dismissal of Mrs. Morris was a reasonable act because they feared they could no longer trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t mean.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you trust your children to a person you have been rude to, even by mistake?
Your newborn?
Let's be real."
Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby just two months ago and that she was in a "very difficult situation."
“Will you attack someone who is in such a situation?
That’s not good,” the banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the public immediately condemned the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington publishers fear readers won’t be able to connect to the bear they’re talking about, new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter who was born shortly after accepting the book, said of the letter: “It’s really hard to put yourself in the place of someone reading the book for the first time before it’s published.
It’s very interesting that we now know all this about Paddington’s huge success.
After saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the book from a small bear-shaped toy, would still be optimistic if his work was not well received, she added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "both bitter and sweet" after his death last year.
For Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she adds that her father felt quiet pride about his potential success.
"He was a really quiet man and he didn't want to brag at all," she said.
But because Paddington felt so real, it was almost like having a child who had achieved something in life: and you are proud of him even though success is not due to you.
I think Paddington’s success felt that way.
Although it was a creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the merits to Paddington itself.
My daughter was on her deathbed and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad would call me regularly to tell me that the situation was very bad and that he was not expected to survive," said Mrs Eden-Laperouse.
“Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did to her.
And I said, "Tashi, I really love you, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The effect of the medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping was slowly diminishing and they were coming out of her system.
She died earlier, and this meant that all of her systems were failing.
I just had to sit and wait, aware of the fact that all this is happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream, or cry because I was surrounded by family members and people.
I really had to stay put.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednane-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, unaware of the difficult situation she was going through.
"Nobody knew," she said.
“I bowed my head and my tears stopped.
It's hard to explain, but while I was on the plane, I felt immense sympathy for Over.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I know how much you loved her."
Women put their cards on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide make efforts to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys set up cards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call to ask for support.
Mrs. Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says her son had great potential to become a chef, as well as an infectious smile.
“Everyone remembers him with his smile.
“People always said that his smile could light up any room.”
However, he gave up his job before he died because he was “in a really dark place.”
His brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found Tyler in 2014 after taking his own life.
Mrs. Davis said, “I’m constantly afraid that it will have a consequent effect.”
Mrs. Davis makes the cards "for others to let them know that there are people out there they can turn to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
“You don’t sit in silence, you have to start talking.”
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis's, lost her partner, Mark, to whom she had been married for 15 years shortly after his mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt unhappy or depressed, that is, he didn't say anything," she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He reached the bottom of Christmas Day when the children opened their gifts, and he did not look them in the eye and made any contact with them.
She said his death was a huge trauma to all of them, but they must find a way to get through it: “This kind of thing is ruining the family.
We remain broken.
But we have to move on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain after FBI investigation begins
"I thought that if we could actually get something similar to what he was looking for, that is, a limited-time, limited-range investigation, maybe we could achieve a small unity," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "disintegrating" in conditions of a ingrained guerrilla state.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their hesitation is solely due to the timing.
The midterm elections are due to take place in just a few weeks, on November 6, and if Republicans are expected to fail, then they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to elect their man to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through whom she met his wife Ashley, who, in turn, worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate vote, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to change the outcome and enter the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees in North Korea has “reduced” under the leadership of Kim
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Unification Ministry of South Korea that last year there were 1,127 border crossings compared to 2011, when there were 2,706.
Mr Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs on human smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The majority of North Koreans have been granted citizenship in South Korea over time.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the well-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.
China considers these people illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them by force.
North-South relations, which technically are still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to discuss topics that focused on stalling denuclearization talks.
This followed a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore where they generally agreed to work towards the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula.
But North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed U.S. sanctions for stagnating progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, we cannot unilaterally be the first to disarm," Ree said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
The minority leader in the House called Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said that taking into account his temperament, he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman acted this way, they would say she was 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blassey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional in his opening speech, sometimes even shouting and libbing as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also clearly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the allegations against him “a grotesque and coordinated destruction of his reputation” organized by liberals who are angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony is proof that he can't serve in the Supreme Court because he has proven biased against Democrats.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi did not answer the question of whether she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if the allegations against him were confirmed and if the Democrats won the majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only not fit to serve in the Supreme Court, he’s not fit to serve in the court where he’s in office at the moment,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she is concerned about the possible verdicts Kavanaugh will pass against the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered the subject of conservative justice.
In the confirmation hearings for his candidacy, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'That's really wonderful, isn't it,'" Pelosi said.
Women should also use it.
It’s really harsh criticism, months and years of gathering anger, which she can’t get rid of without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s unusual, right?”
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was in office somewhere, who told me that she was crying when she was angry, but she was able to develop her own technique, so when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continues to cry.
I think that’s genius.”
Tears are allowed as an exhaust valve for anger in part because they are essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest memories of one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office was when I once started crying with indescribable anger and an older woman, a cold manager I had always had some fear of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me up the stairs.
“Never let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll enjoy the fact that they’ve managed to reach out to you.”
Patricia Schroeder was a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado at the time and worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair on a boat called "Monkey Business" and withdrew from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, realized that there was no reason why she should not reconsider the idea of running for president.
"It wasn't a well-thought-out decision," he told me 30 years later, laughing.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given the fact that the campaign was launched a long time ago, she did not have enough funds, so she promised that she would not enter the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She learned that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000 each, would only give her $250.
“Do they think there should be a discount for me?” she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions, i.e. gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters, not delegates and anger at sexism, she began to cry.
"If you had seen me, you would probably have thought I was having a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to the incident.
“You’d think Clinex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"She's crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be a good thing for Beijing
The opening of fire with the start of the U.S.-China trade war was stifling and while the battle is far from over, a clash between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by taxing key exports to China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The situation has escalated significantly this week with the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of goods coming to the United States from China.
Beijing each time returned to nature, that is, recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to return the U.S. on an equal footing, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will give up the same soon.
To force Washington to step down would be to accept its demands, but public worship of the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays well, pressures from the trade war with the United States could result in positive support for China in the long run as it reduces the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for the start of a sharp decline from an economic point of view in any of the countries is much more dangerous than what was previously determined by observers," said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Studies.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is making efforts to help rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a long war that has lasted for more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said conditions in the country were improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas devastated by terrorists in order to restore the situation to normal.
Now all conditions are provided for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilaterally introduced economic measures that affected their daily lives.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
An additional six million people living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime welcomes assistance in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beat the US team in the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 vs. 10.5 at Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The United States has lost six times in a row in Europe and has not won the European Ryder Cup title since 1993.
Europe regained its primacy after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who faced difficulties during most of the tournament, on his first punch from a hole pointed the ball into the water in par-3 of the 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari distinguished himself in all rounds, becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament began to be organized in the current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost 5:4 to the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, the world's highest-ranked player, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have last played in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a participant in eight Ryder Cups, became the European who won the most tournament titles with 25.5 points during his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stop.
This year has been really hard.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I’m so glad we got the title back.
The team game is the most important and I am happy to be able to help," said emotional Garcia after Europe's victory.
He now cedes the place to his compatriot John Rum, who beat Tiger Woods, the American legend of golf, 2–1 on Sunday.
"I feel incredibly proud to beat Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him play," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an incredible statistic of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles, ranking after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team spent the entire weekend trying to steer the game towards low grass terrain, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-quality golf throughout the tournament.
Team Captain Jim Furrick said, "I'm proud of these guys, they really fought.
This morning we had a great time with the team from Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American Professional Golfers Association and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
We have to admit it.
We've been outplayed.
