She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I haven't talked to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks French to me.
Tom left a high tip on the table.
There's nothing above a glass of beer after a full day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far, I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
If I were you, I'd ask him.
Leave them for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to the meeting, even though I was invited.
Are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get off at the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you paid a lot for it.
Tom is obviously lying.
So straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have any food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'll have to get back to you.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be thirteen the day after tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch them ruin their lives.
Do everything with caution.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you do.
We climbed to the top of Mount Fuji.
My wife and I want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember how she was?
My belt's too tight.
Playing the bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Ancient customs are rapidly dying out today.
Tom's still busy.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I'm sorry to interrupt, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom yelling at the crowd?
He is the ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a costume party in the seventeenth century.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I once admired Tom.
He climbed the tree with great effort.
Translation of the Czech text is very difficult.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood there too.
We know all that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought this to my attention.
I skipped breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
The hail is falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom didn't hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like the tie.
We weren't doing as well as we wanted.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you have a fight with Joana?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom had an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Are you going to school by train?
Tom's not going to school today.
I'm mad at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He's single.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom carefully washed his feet.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a flea when she got her recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you helped us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He visits his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary could.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.
Tom hasn't recovered.
I told Tom he was a fake friend and he was offended.
Laundry.
This bridge used to be a toll bridge.
He waved at her.
I was late for school this morning.
I took part in the search.
Sam went straight to bed.
We shot at the lawn by the river.
Tom never drank hard alcohol.
Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm completely happy myself.
You did what you had to do.
We must understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played tennis with Mary last night.
What's your dad's name?
There were half-broken walls.
I spoke to him in English and found that I could talk to him.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Have any of you ever talked to Tom?
You should apologise.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're getting fat.
We should win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer my questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and never came back.
Did you bring the book?
I dare not open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about divorcing her.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
Who are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else to read it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything bad about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we had a burst of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than to live red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It'd be great if you did this for me.
Tom knows what he's saying.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse grunts.
I lent Tom the comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not such a snitch anymore.
You're not gonna believe what Tom just told me.
Mary has no one to talk to, but she doesn't feel alone.
If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go hiking.
Try talking to the police.
You like elephants.
I don't want to change anything.
Bartender, I'll have a drink.
Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he went home.
I was in the woods.
Tom got drunk.
He asked me to wait there for him to return.
I made a terrible decision.
I'd better get back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sunday.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do it at night.
Why do you want me to ask them for help when we can handle it ourselves?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Wipe it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's slender.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the balloon to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved?
We like kids.
I wish I was a better man.
You're stealing, huh?
Tom's got to get his hair done.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
Tom is used to it.
I love this book.
The waste is clogged again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone had robbed our apartment.
Read the book.
This used to be a bakery.
My father runs a restaurant.
You're really boring.
I like silent movies.
This works.
Stop yelling.
I'd like to make more money.
I know you're still not happy.
Can the message be true?
He got it easy, he got it easy.
Do you remember seeing me before?
I want to help, but I'm busy right now.
Without her help, I would never have passed the test.
You wouldn't be happier if I told you.
Can you translate from French to English?
A lot of people were waiting for him.
Tom told Mary he didn't plan to go swimming with us.
For God's sake, Tom, what the hell is this?

I don't know how old Tom is.
I'd like you to come with me.
I told Tom it wasn't over yet.

Please don't do this.
You'll be happy again.

The first jump went wrong.
Well, let's have lunch.
We should give him a present.
In England, the waiter asked us, "How much beer would you like to drink, half a pint or a whole?" Since we had no idea how much it could be, we asked him to show us the glasses.
