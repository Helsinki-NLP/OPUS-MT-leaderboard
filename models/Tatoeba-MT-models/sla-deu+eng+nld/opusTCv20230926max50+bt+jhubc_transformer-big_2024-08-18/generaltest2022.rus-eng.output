From my point of view, the literature program was formed by women of Balzac age on the basis of their interests.
From the Russian literature of the 19th century, we preferred Danilevsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote belletristics, of course, from the point of view of those same ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torture of the heroines of Tolstoy and Turgenev for teenagers are not so interesting.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.
Perhaps the roses were teddy bears to represent a certain variety of them?
There are roses of this color and with such a petal structure resembling velvet, as a rule, dark red, burgundy tones.
And the bright roses look different, the petals have just a satin or silky shine.

There is no support.
I remember with horror these feasts and the guests in the parents' house.
Guests on the doorstep, and on the stove, the cutlets are roasted, the mother glazed home the floor.
Oh, my God, I couldn't sit at the table.
And then wash the dishes, clean the house.
A week before the holiday, you're taking food, two days of wheezing, a day of cleaning after.
What about the guests?
They are fine, and the cake must be with them.
Since then, I don't like holidays, guests.
Even for my family, I cover the table at a minimum.
And I cook them, I bake them very often just like that.
Germany: Fourth Coronavirus Vaccine Inevitable
A fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or autumn of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with renewed strength.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, no two or three doses of the coronavirus vaccine is likely to be enough for full protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
On Saturday, December 11, reports Die Welt.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be required in the summer, at the latest in the autumn," the expert said.
In addition, Weigeldt hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccine can be carried out “in combination with the flu vaccine.”
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination can help combat the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron".
The new option is particularly dangerous.
Thus, the probability of re-infection with "Omicron" is three times higher than that of Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide a vaccine adapted to Omikron by March 2022.
The companies emphasize that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omicron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer found that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness is significantly lower: “the neutralizing potential is reduced by more than 25 times.”
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide adequate protection against omicrone strain infection," BioNTech and Pfizer said in a statement.
A third dose is required.
Experts insist on accelerating the pace of vaccination in the country.
For example, the chairman of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, Bernd Salzberger, is in favor of reducing the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, Salzberger believes that accelerated vaccination will affect the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
“The experience of Israel shows this very convincingly,” the expert stressed.
Wobbler Pontoon21, Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g
The Bet-A-Vib series is a special branch of the Bet-A family from Pontoon21<0xC2><0xAE>.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) differs from many other vibes in that it was originally created taking into account the use for ice fishing, and not just for catching in the future.
These vibes have a larger than those of similar in size, specific weight, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of the use of these interesting baits.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and elastic plastic, which creates additional shades of vibration in vertical and horizontal wiring.
As a "winter vibe" when caught in the balance Bet-A-Vib demonstrates a rather aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the up-and-down motion of the hammer almost without pauses.
When planning, the deviation from the vertical axis is not very large, which is convenient when fishing in a limited space, clogged by underwater vegetation, troughs and other obstacles, for which it is possible to catch.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when fishing for winter bait and large perch, and especially in the middle of winter, when point and aggressive feeding of the bait is required.
After reaching the extreme point of the trajectory, Bet-A-Vib instantly unfolds and returns to the original vertical.
No less successfully Bet-A-Vib is used for winter fishing of pond trout.
To please her whim, you can choose from two modifications: with or without a noise capsule (NS – NanoSound) (SL – Silent).
It is also noted that Bet-A-Vib game in the balance is able to irritate the passive pike, not responding even to the nerve.
When fishing, Bet-A-Vib demonstrates range and accuracy.
This wobbler is understandable and not capricious, it combines well with the hazel and braided cords of even large diameters.
For fishing, pike, sudak, ersh or perch in addition to uniform is relevant and "step", sometimes with a "chircane" on the bottom.
If you catch in hardened places, you can replace the front tee with a double, which will reduce the likelihood of catches.
Among the lures of its class Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable in the work and, as a consequence, one of the most catchy.
It can be used with equal success both in relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the necks of old parents.

7,000 Russian mercenaries reported in Libya
In Libya, there are more than 7,000 mercenaries of the private military company Wagner.
This was stated on Sunday, December 12, the Chairman of the Supreme State Council of the Republic Khaled al-Mishri.
Currently, there are more than 7,000 Wagner PMC mercenaries in Libya.
They also have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jets at Gardabiya airbases (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte),” Anadolu quoted him as saying.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are “trying to capture” the central part of Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after “bringing their man to power” in the Central African Republic.
Maintaining Presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and “located in Libya.”
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an air base and port in Sirte, as well as an air base in Jufra, the agency said in a statement.
The Russian authorities officially deny that PMC Wagner enjoys the support of the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, "Wagner" is supposedly operating in nine countries in Africa - the CAR, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training of local forces, personal protection of leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses for the use of minerals and natural resources, as well as for the supply of weapons, technology and military services to these countries.
According to the media, “Wagners” allegedly fought in the Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the CAR.
This group is neither included in the law enforcement agencies, nor in the register of legal entities, and its fighters are absent from the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under U.S. sanctions.
Earlier, the ambassadors of 27 EU countries approved restrictions against Wagner.
This decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on 13 December.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with advisory functions with Islamists dominating it.
This body has repeatedly called for the postponement of a single day of voting on the elections of deputies of parliament and the head of state from December 24 at least to February 2022.
“There are less than two weeks left before the elections, and the chances that they will pass on time are rapidly decreasing,” the report said.
Against this background, the Supreme Election Commission of Libya postponed indefinitely the announcement of the final list of candidates, reports the channel Sky News Arabia.
Foreign Policy Through the Eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see in the foreign policy of the country more successes than failures, 29% believe that failures prevail.
Examples of success - "in Syria they protected, restored peace there", "the decision on the "Nord stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated that the cool weapons", "Crimea we squeezed".
The main failures are “conflict with Ukraine”, “confrontation with Western countries”, “isolation from the world”, – stated in the study of the Foundation “Public opinion”.
The government of Dubai has completely abandoned paperwork - all public services have also become only digital
The Dubai government has announced the complete abandonment of paperwork and the transition to digital technologies.
All public services to the population will also be provided exclusively in electronic form.
This is reported by the Emirates news agency WAM.

The transition to e-Government and document digitization has begun in Dubai since 2018.
During this time, according to the authorities, 336 million paper sheets were saved, which is 14 million hours of human labor and 353.8 million dollars in monetary equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.
Dana, well, about the dates of birth and how old the child is, it's already a joke, about the class and the group in kindergarten too.

They knocked on the door first, then the window, then decided not to get ceremonial, smashed the window and walked in, but Grandpa had a baseball bat that they got.
These people knew for sure that there was someone at home...
Turkey’s car production and exports fall below 2020 levels
Turkey’s car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the indicators of the industry in the 11 months turned out to be worse than last year’s result, according to Bloomberg, citing data from the Association of Automobile Manufacturers of Turkey.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced from factories in Turkey, which is 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% below last year’s figure.
And if in the first 10 months of this year, the automotive sector of Turkey showed a positive dynamics by the last year, then in the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year’s figure.
The reason for this fall was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November fell by 29% against the dollar.
This has led to a decline in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SME entities received deferred credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov spoke about the situation of granting benefits for small and medium-sized businesses, MIA correspondent Kazinform reports.
"According to the information of the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan for regulation and development of the financial market, this year, pursuant to the order of the Head of State of April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency of April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, Alikhan Smailov wrote in his answer to the deputy's request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferred payments on loans provided for the provision by banks and organizations carrying out microfinance activities of deferred payments on loans issued before April 1, 2021 to SME entities, including IPs, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The deferral period was from 30 to 90 days at the choice of the SME entity.
The borrower's application could indicate a different period of deferral of payments.
During the period of deferral against the borrower, the claim work, notification of the need to repay the overdue debt, as well as the creditor's collection of commissions and other payments were suspended," the deputy prime minister said.
For 2021, the banks of the second level received applications for deferral of payments on loans of 603 borrowers-subjects of SMEs, of which 553 entities of SMEs received deferral in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.

Pulmonologist Puryasev suggested that people with weak immunity are able to easily tolerate the strain "Okmiron"
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate it more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body
Pulmonologist Sergei Puryasev explained why the strain of the coronavirus "okmiron" can be dangerous.
The reason should be sought in the conditions of the origin of the virus.
Scientists believe that "okmiron" originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient.
That is, during the mutation, he did not meet any resistance to immunity.
This makes him more aggressive.
Due to the fact that there was no response from immunity, it became very fast.
Apparently, there he has these spike proteins, spikes, maybe more than it should, their antibodies were not cut during mutations, - says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immunity can tolerate "ocmiron" more easily than those who have a strong protective reaction of the body.
It turns out that the body’s strong response to anything, to any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body can kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, when a 30-year-old dies, and 60-year-olds in the form of a sneeze tolerate it.
The immune response is furious in the young man, he is completely inadequate: where it was possible only to threaten with a finger, he beats like from a cannon on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasev.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects and the most unpleasant of them is pneumonia.
Inflammation of the lungs can be bacterial and viral.
If the first is treated very successfully and quickly, in the second case, it is often possible to stop only the symptoms - all hope for the body.
The first sign of developing pneumonia will be the onset of intoxication of the body - temperature, weakness, malaise.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: difficulty breathing, sore throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, in Russia, until the end of the year can begin to vaccinate the younger generation from 12 to 18 years.
The virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering MIPT Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from angioedema.
Teenagers who go to school have the maximum number of contacts.
This is the most socially active layer, as well as pupils of kindergartens, - Pavel Volchkov, virologist, head of the laboratory of genomic engineering of MIPT, told "Moscow 24".
Thank you very much to the author for this article.
I am happy to refresh my memories...

In those distant seventies-eighties, no dance floor could do without the melodies of this group.
And at home, gathering with friends, we organized dances to their music.
Immunologists have hypothesized why people with obesity become victims of ovarian cancer
The authors studied the fat tissue left over from bariatric operations and found that fat cells known as adipocytes could become infected with the coronavirus.
Immune cells located in adipose tissue, macrophages, also became infected, and showed a strong inflammatory reaction.
The scientists also examined the adipose tissue of patients who died from the disease and found coronavirus particles in the fat surrounding various organs.
It is known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in adipose tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to avoid the immune system’s response.
SARS-CoV-2 is probably capable of this.
The biologist told about the causes of dementia
Candidate of biological sciences Semen Golosheikin called the causes of dementia and told about the ways of its prevention in an interview with Radio Sputnik.
According to WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is manifested by a gradual loss of cognitive functions - over time, a person finds it difficult to navigate even in a familiar environment.
Golosheikin noted that neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders and a lack of certain vitamins most often lead to dementia.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, the role of factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity is possible," he said.
The development of dementia is also affected by bad habits - smoking, alcohol abuse, sleep disorders and sedentary lifestyle.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer's disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence," the biologist added.
To prevent the onset of the disease, WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require the involvement of memory and logic.
Previously, Professor of the Department of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Medical Genetics of FGAOU at RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, Head of the Department of Cognitive Disorders of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt has returned about 30,000 illegally exported artifacts
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to return some 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was announced on Saturday, December 11, on the air of the TV channel Al-Hayat, the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gauad.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 monuments of ancient Egyptian civilization were discovered at the Bible Museum in Washington, D.C.,” he said.
Abdel Gauad clarified that all smuggled artifacts are registered in the archives.
The department is currently working on their return to Egypt.
In particular, experts "track auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian sites, as well as social networks.
The chief inspector said that upon return, cultural values are restored and then exhibited in museums.
According to him, one of the returned artifacts was an ancient skeleton of a man discovered in Belgium, which is now part of the exposition of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, the Egyptian authorities asked Interpol to help find the bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun sold at an auction in London.
Christie's auction house held a bidding on July 4, at which a bust over 3,000 years old was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused dissatisfaction on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the art object was illegally taken out of the Karnak Temple in Luxor in the 1970s.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted in the image of the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been put up for auction since 1985.
How the relic came to Europe is unknown.
Egypt in recent years has been actively seeking the repatriation of illegally removed from the country at different times of antiquity monuments.
According to the authorities, 95% of smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological excavations of “black diggers”.
"The Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and this is correct, since the Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - so many Tatars (Kazakhs) live in the Crimea (see the census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
Credit Suisse Wants to Access Employees’ Personal Mobile Devices
Credit Suisse requires its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, writes the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the United States, the Swiss bank does not give its employees corporate communication devices, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner - a telecommunications operator.
According to the current rules, the bank can view information on corporate devices issued to its employees, as they are used to solve business issues with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a client that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now, after many employees have switched to remote mode, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that have been used to solve work issues.
According to the newspaper, the management of the bank has set a deadline by which employees can familiarize themselves with the new rule.
Officially, Credit Suisse does not comment on the new requirement.

Part 4
The last year of Sergei Yesenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of creativity, but the most difficult for the earthly existence of the poet and his "ego".
He is already outside of any literary associations, he is infused with imaginaryism, he is in himself, but he is known, in demand, sometimes strongly scolded by critics, even maliciously, but the reading audience is ready to wear it on his hands.
During the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" has been completed, the poem "Anna Snegin" has been written, 8 books have been published, the collection "Soviet Russia".
And the main success - at the end of June 25-th year Gosizdat signed a contract with Yesenin for the publication of his works in 3 volumes.
None of the modern poets Sergei Alexandrovich was not awarded such an honor, he is the first!
In addition, it promised very good money - under the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the plant director, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
Funds were needed this year more than ever.
Yesenin married the granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy Sophia Tolstoy, it was necessary to arrange family life, to support the sisters Katya and Sasha, as well as the mother.
It would seem that life is getting better, there is something to rejoice in, but for him everything is painted mainly in dark tones, as if a nightmare materialized from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after Yesenin's death):
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick.
I don’t know where that pain came from.
Is the wind whistling?
Over an empty and uninhabited field,
When I'm growing up in September,
Drinking alcohol is brainwashing.
Many acquaintances noted that Yesenin has given up strongly, looks bad, is clearly ill.
Increasingly, seizures, nervous breakdowns are repeated.
And the reason, probably, is not only in alcoholism...
However, if such a diagnosis - alcoholism - was made by someone Sergei Alexandrovich, there are no reliable documents.
For example, referring to May 1923, when Yesenin at the insistence of his fourth wife, the American Isadora Duncan improved his health in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Jesenin will get to him again two years later, already in Moscow).
But the evidence of the poet's singing, scandals on this ground, reasons for the police are enough - scattered over dozens of memoirs.
Since the beginning of the 20s, the terrible novel of the poet with the green snake has developed rapidly.
In the late summer of 1923, Yesenin briefly settled with a friend, the imaginist Ivan Startsev.
Surprisingly, Yesenin, with his very good income, never had his own housing either in Moscow or in St. Petersburg, he found it in rented apartments, in hotels or at acquaintances.
The old man recalls:
“I came only for the night, and in most cases in an insane, drunken state.
One day, returning at four o’clock in the morning, Yesenin fell on the stairwell.
Falling, scratched his face and hoarse.
Having recovered a little, he constantly began to cough, sprinkling all the sheets with blood.
Yesenin himself after the war in Europe and the United States (then there was a dry law in the United States, but Duncan took with her a decent supply of alcohol) admitted:
“I didn’t see anything there except the cobblers and the streets.
I'm already at the end and people have stopped remembering...
Well, and drinking, of course...
“I drank because I was thirsty.”

A father takes care of his young daughter.
And he loves, as Lermontov wrote, "strange love."
Why did the girl cry in the exam when she hadn't failed it yet?
Why didn't he tell his daughter that it wasn't a school?
Well, she'll have a tail.
So what?
He'll resuscitate.
Millions of students know this.

The Polish Foreign Ministry believes that Belarus uses migrants as a “weapon”
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawe<0xC5><0x82> Jablo<0xC5><0x84>ski said that Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko used refugees as a “weapon” against the European Union and intends to return to such an “operation” next year.
A corresponding statement by the Deputy Foreign Minister was made in an interview with the newspaper Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonsky, the sanctions against Belarus temporarily “stop Lukashenko”, but he “is actively looking for new ways”.
Also, the Polish official is confident that now illegal migrants will be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
According to the website kp.ru, earlier the European Union has put into effect the fifth package of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
In Europe, they said they were ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic, “if the situation in the country does not improve”.
In response, Minsk imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not in the Shadow's Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man laugh
The worldly events of 2021 were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die" he appeared in a velvet raspberry jacket and a traditional "bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket that did not match the royal dress code at the award ceremony, and then chose a more classic option for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity foundation.
A couple of weeks ago, the trend was tried by Lionel Messi.
The player came to pick up the seventh “Golden Ball” in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were dressed in the same.
AliExpress already notes the growing demand for velvet men’s jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, received in "Gazeta.Ru", they began to buy 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a lining and a silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models - from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - sets of velvet suits they choose less often.
You can buy them not only from online retailers.
Budget options are available in H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets this season are presented in almost all brands - and Brioni, and Paul Smith, and Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable is the Gucci model, in which he came out at one of the premieres of the film "Gucci House" brand ambassador Jared Leto.
Choosing jackets of expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
Thanks to the special technology of intertwining the threads, a dense fabric with a velvety outer texture and a smooth inner side is obtained.
More budget options are made of cotton or polyamide, but, accordingly, serve less.
Fashion expert Lamoda Ilya Vakhoshkin, warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the main thing is not his model or style, but relevance.
"Barhat requires evening light, so such a jacket is ideal if you are going to a party or a solemn event," Vahoshkin explains. - It is also suitable for those cases if the invitation indicates the dress code "Black Tie" or "Creative Black Tie".
Another important criterion, the observance of which allows you to make a choice in favor of a velvet jacket, is the status of its buyer.
"The man in the velvet jacket, first of all, should get the right advanced party with plenty, - say the authors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion "Beauty Brammell." - Owners of velvet jackets, as a rule, belong to the caste of those people who rarely buy tickets.
They are simply invited to timed secular events, where the dress code is always indicated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin offers to combine a velvet jacket with the same fancy things: classic pants with arrows, monochrome shirts, silk ties, lophers with brushes, cufflinks.
Too simple and everyday things will look inappropriate.
Fashion experts from "Beauty Brammell" are sure: it will be inappropriate to appear in the velvet jacket of an ordinary employee at the corporate party, but if we are talking about "the head of those who run this event, then - "yes", he has such a thing in the subject."
If the employee ranks lower, and his goal is the desire to advance higher in the complex hierarchy of the company or knock out financial bonuses, then it is better not to wear a velvet jacket.
The leadership will definitely appreciate the phrase "not for a hat," - say the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion.
Very ambiguous feeling from the voice.
It's an unnatural timbre, so weary of pulling.
And it is not at all associated with the pretty face of a young girl.
Honestly, I don't understand the admiration of others.
But with all my heart I wish you good luck in life!
It’s all about money – alternative energy is well lobbied, that is, paid for.
Billions of investments.
Are they in mourning?
No, the price of electricity has risen.
Traditional energy is also out of stock - both gas and oil and coal were bought cheaper than they are now sold.
The demand for fuel is wild.
The spear drips.
Then who's in the air?
As usual, an ordinary buyer.
Do Indian problems affect the sheriff?
Therefore, Western politicians should not be considered idiots who are “sleeping” the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good salary.
I didn’t see a single beautiful person in the photo.
It's just mediocrity within the average passenger.
Perhaps, if such characters are so confident in their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole car, then they will not fit in, most likely.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of such "beautiful" people, but certainly not because of their appearance.
“A slave who is aware of his slavish position and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and who permeates in a silent, unconscious and speechless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave whose saliva flows when he self-sufficiently describes the charms of a slave life and delights in a good and good master, is a slob, a ham."
The immunologist said that the revaccination after 4-5 months will help protect against the strain of the coronavirus "Omicron"
Revaccination after four to five months can protect against a new strain of coronavirus infection "Omicron".
This statement was made by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called the vaccination after six months, taking into account the appearance of a new strain, "a very large period."
"With previous strains, this period was normal, but now it is best to carry out the procedure in five months, and people with chronic diseases in four," the expert said, urging, in parallel with the vaccination campaign, to engage in revaccination.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
“If a person was given two vaccinations and a booster, or he got sick and vaccinated, or he got vaccinated and got sick, then he got “hybrid immunity”, that is, there are many antibodies and neutralizing enough,” the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of “large-scale consequences” in case of invasion of Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) issued a statement following a meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It emphasizes that Russia’s “military aggression” against Ukraine “will have huge consequences and will cost dearly” to Moscow, but specific measures in the document are not described.
“We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia’s military build-up and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine,” the statement said.
The ministers also called on Russia to “weaken the escalation, use diplomatic channels and comply with its international obligations regarding the transparency of military activities,” as US President Biden spoke during a video call to Russian President Putin on December 7.
“We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements in order to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine,” the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to change borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price in return,” they warned.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its future.
We welcome the restrained position of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response,” the statement said.
Earlier in the day, the head of British diplomacy, Elizabeth Trass, said that Russia would suffer “serious consequences” in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
According to her, this meeting showed “the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine will have huge consequences for Russia.”
Pfizer vaccine found to be 32 times less effective than omicrone strain
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower compared to other types of the disease.
This conclusion was reached by scientists from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, reports South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective on the basis of a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the drug from COVID-19.
“We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variety,” said Prof Malik Peyris.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Previously, scientists of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic, taking into account the impact of the omicron-tree.
The authors of the study concluded that the omicrone strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increase mortality if no additional measures were taken.
The head of the Ministry of defense of Ukraine accused Germany in blocking the supply of NATO weapons to Kiev
The head of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine Alexey Reznikov accused the government of the former Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel in blocking the acquisition of deadly weapons by Kiev within the framework of NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine’s purchase of anti-sniper systems and rifles to defeat drones.
At the same time, it is noted that later Berlin softened its position on the rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to seek the acquisition of the above-mentioned weapons in the framework of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, we are talking about the United States, Great Britain, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under the leadership of Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the permission of arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, the Ambassador of Ukraine to Germany Andrei Melnyk expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect from Berlin the supply of weapons under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons at the risk of developing a military escalation of the conflict in the Donbass, despite the “occupation by Russia” of part of Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will keep under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky said that Kiev expects help from Berlin in equipping the navy.
In Ukraine, they expect that Germany "will be a partner of Ukraine in the technical sense," the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the Co-Chairman of the Green party of Germany Robert Habeck visited the republic, where he advocated the sale of defensive weapons to Kiev.

According to the second, Verstappen was ahead of Hamilton to the "restart" zone.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
G7 foreign ministers have warned of “serious consequences” for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, the statement said.
The participants of the meeting also noted that they condemn the intensification of the Russian armed forces at the borders of the country.
“Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs,” the statement said.
The G7 ministers and the EU High Representative noted that they are “united in their condemnation of Russia’s armed reinforcement and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine.”
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Trass warned at a press conference in Liverpool of “great consequences” for Russia in the event of an invasion of Ukraine.
We have made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression against Ukraine,” she said.
Earlier at the summit in Liverpool, the G7 foreign ministers agreed that to resolve the crisis due to the build-up of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine, the parties need to return to the negotiating table.
The talks were held in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported the dialogue on Ukraine in the Normandy format.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries “have expressed their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes.”

Revealed ways to return stolen money through online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen through online stores and not become a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in a conversation with RBC.
Thus, to reduce the risk of major losses when the data of the bank card is in the hands of attackers, it is recommended to store the main funds on the card or bank account, which are not used in online shopping.
Some of the savings can be deposited into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend a separate card for online purchases.
If the money was stolen when shopping in stores that do not use 3D Secure, you can start a refund procedure.
“Within the framework of the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without the use of 3D Secure, responsibility is assigned to that participant in the payment chain who does not use this service,” the representative of Promsvyazbank said.
The expert from the international payment provider Ecommpay Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to apply to the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if the offender used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authorization, the transaction can be challenged and refunded.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves return funds to the customer, if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, director of the Safe Internet League, Ekaterina Mizulina, said that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand appeals were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to the theft of personal data.
According to her, an effective solution under the current circumstances can be the creation of a single window for complaints about online fraudsters.
Scholz arrives in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the crisis with migrants on the border with Belarus, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the build-up of Russian troops near the borders of Ukraine and the situation with the Russian Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz declared his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would call on Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia can use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland’s efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to get into the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels resolve the crisis.
Poland’s judicial system, however, remains one of the reasons for the differences.
The European Court of Justice has fined Poland, finding that judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violate EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national legislation takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany’s new government, which was sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has made no public commitment to halt Nord Stream 2 in the event of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
U.S. officials told members of Congress that they had reached an agreement with Germany to stop the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said on Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia breaches Ukraine’s border, a position the G7 confirmed on Sunday.
Dmitry, look closely.

You have to wash them once a year for Easter, or whatever, you have to wash them clean.

The Ministry of Digits wants to give writers residences
The state will transfer to the future Fund of support of Russian writers federal property, which remains inherited from the Union of Writers of the USSR and the Literary Fund of the USSR.
Writer’s residences will be created on its basis, the Parliamentary Gazette in Minzifri, which will become the founder of the foundation, said.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is preparing a draft presidential decree on the creation of the Fund for support of Russian writers.
The explanatory note specifies that the foundation will be tasked with taking care of, among other things, the purposeful use and preservation of buildings and structures that once belonged to the Soviet Union writers and Litfond.
“A significant number of real estate objects that previously belonged to the Literary Fund of the USSR, including objects located in the town of writers Peredelkino, the village Komarovo of the Leningrad region and others, passed into the property of the Russian Federation,” the press service of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported.
The draft decree prescribes to reflect in the statute of the Fund that it is “created in order to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of writers”.
"By "creating conditions for creative activity" means the creation of writer's residences on the basis of transferred property in different regions of Russia, in which there would be comfortable conditions for creativity," - explained in the Ministry.

Found money in the wall of the church plumber will pay $ 20 thousand
The plumber who found the money in the church wall in the U.S. state of Texas will pay a reward.
This was reported in a press release of the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident occurred in a large evangelical church in Lakewood, where pastor Joel Austin preaches, promising that devout Christians await wealth and prosperity.
In November 2021, Justin Cowley, a plumber, repaired one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under thermal insulation.
He handed over the find of the church and, according to him, did not even receive thanks from Austin.
“I wanted to hear him say, ‘You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you’ve done and what you could have done,” he told KPRC-TV.
The discovery appears to be linked to a theft that occurred at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in cheques that were stored in the church safe were lost.
The money was insured, so the church did not suffer losses.
However, for information about the criminals announced a reward of 25 thousand dollars.
Justin Cowley could not claim this amount because the award has already expired.
Despite this, the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston, which at one time allocated $5,000 for the award and later received another $20,000 as a gift from the Church of Lakewood, decided to reward the integrity of the plumber.
He'll get $20,000.
Earlier it was reported that the police questioned pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of the church Lakewood.
Tanya, her statements, her actions - this is her characteristic "as a real person".
That is why the attitude towards it is so negative.
And it’s not that “she’s financially significantly richer than all the writers,” as they say here.
There are people who are richer, but not everyone behaves as brazenly as this lady.

In Brazil, they were obliged to demand from entering the territory of the state covid passport, the relevant decision was made by the judge of the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (STF) Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempted from presenting a certificate of vaccination.
Also in the list of exceptions are people who came from countries where the lack of a vaccine is proven.
“The situation is even more serious, given that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year’s, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in the tourist flow,” Barroso said.
Earlier, the Brazilian authorities ordered unvaccinated tourists from the coronavirus infection to observe a five-day quarantine.
Full protection against COVID-19 has been revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored scientist of Russia Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed a scheme of full protection against coronavirus infection.
According to him, this can be achieved by injection and the use of a nasal vaccine.
With internal use, large amounts of immunoglobulins A are formed. When the vaccine is administered by injection, this does not happen.
Immunoglobulins A protect the mucous membrane, so the virus can not penetrate the body.
And inside, after vaccination, we have the most immunoglobulins G (antibodies).
And if you inject both vaccines, you will get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there is no solution for double vaccination yet," the doctor said.
The chief prophylactologist of UrFO, Doctor of Medical Sciences Sergey Tokarev, in turn, said that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injectable vaccination is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help by the fact that in this case, the protection of the body, presumably, should become maximum.
Earlier, the Minister of health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Guseynov said that a new outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic will lead to the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children.
According to him, this is the picture seen in other countries, where the next wave of the pandemic came earlier.
Inna, um...
I talked to the dog (died a long time ago) like this - if you are ready to replace a warm house, feed, caress, love and games for a liquid bitch, then go ahead.
But the pessary was trained and smart at all.
He chose my company and went home.
The video method, which works in 90% of cases.
Not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped many owners from running after the dog, although they believed that there were 200,000 people running away (Pomsky), I took my hand and took it to the other side.
In the end, “200,000” chose the owner, not the dog that ran somewhere there.
In Europe, the mass protests of opponents of vaccinations do not stop
More than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with the authorities’ restrictive measures and plans to make vaccination against anthelmintics mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
The Spaniards, outraged by the health policy of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held in their hands posters with the inscription “This is a false pandemic”, “I will not be vaccinated”.
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the autonomous community, a covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment facilities.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports authorities in several regions of the country took amid the increase in the number of cases of coronavirus infection.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictive measures and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then turned into clashes with the guards of order.
A group of demonstrators began throwing stones at police officers.
In response, law enforcement officers used water cannons.
Nikolai S., even in Wikipedia there is no consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also referred to as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started studying earlier.
Let’s just not argue, I think they both deserve this title.
Here is only one thing I agree with Zakharova: the Americans carried only death and plunder to any country, wherever they appeared.

The WHO has found “omicron” in six dozen countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that a new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron" has already been identified in 63 countries.
A number of experts already say that the spread of the new strain can have catastrophic consequences.
The rate of spread of the strain was reported in the WHO report.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain was detected in 63 countries, in all six regions of the WHO.
This is despite the fact that it began to actively spread only from the end of November.
WHO is also concerned about the rapid spread of the new variant of the coronavirus.
WHO experts express concern that the new strain could bypass the extent of the spread of the Delta strain, an Indian variant of the coronavirus that now leads in all countries without exception.
Earlier, the Director General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain can have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar conclusions were reached in the UK as well.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will supplant the Delta in the coming months.
And the number of patients in Britain alone will be about 1 million. This is despite the fact that the official "Omicron" currently in the Kingdom are sick several hundred people, and according to estimates up to 10 thousand.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the strain "Omicron", and at the peak to hospitals will take more than 2,000 people daily.
What the British health care system will not be able to cope with.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the vaccine from Pfizer-BioNTech against the strain "Omicron" is 32 times lower than other types of the disease.
It is not yet known how the Russian Sputnik V reacts to the omicron – this will become clear in the next few weeks.
The Gamaleya Center has just begun testing a Russian vaccine on a strain of Omicron.
Why do we need to see the stages of ageing?

Curious Squirrel, you are right, communication on the Internet is quite different, communicate easily and effortlessly, and in a personal meeting there is nothing to say.
Yes, and to see a person live, maybe this is not what you expected, did not get caught - hence the attitude.

And again, Soviet time is called the “time of demons”.
At that time, people believed in God more honestly than they do today.
And they were brought up practically according to God’s laws (love for your neighbor, do not steal, etc.).
What kind of ideology is money at all costs?
The Globe of Faith is not enough (yes, it is not at all), but even if it is, then the time of demons came in the 90s.
Our St. Petersburg, or rather Leningrad commune with Bolshaya Zelenina maintains communication so far.
Of course, we are not the closest friends, but the warmth of the relationship of the older generation we try to keep.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that there were no visitors in the apartment, the rooms were not rented, and the blockade fraternity was not canceled.
We see each other more and more at funerals.

Both the number of app downloads and user spending showed significant growth between January and November 2021.
The number of downloads increased by 8%, reaching 140 billion. Even more significantly increased user spending in applications: by 25%, to a record $135 billion.
The data was published by the analytical company App Annie, which presented a report on the mobile application market in 2021.
In 2021, the world economy emerged from Lockdown and began a post-pandemic recovery.
"Will such a "return to the physical" growth of the application economy? Not at all," - the authors of the report believe.
India is the leader in the number of downloads of applications: it accounts for about 20% of all downloads.
It is followed by the United States (9%) and Brazil (8%).
Users of iOS gadgets, as before, spent more than users with Android: iOS accounted for 65% of all expenses in applications.
Among the applications, the first place in the number of downloads for 2021 was taken by the video editor CapCut.
It is followed by two Indian apps: the MX TakaTak video service and the Meesho online trading app.
The top 10 in the number of downloads also includes Telegram.

Around the world, people have adapted to the pandemic through the transition to mobile life, which can be called one of the main conclusions.
The most successful industries have been those that have helped people to be closer, both virtually and in person,” said Annie Lexi Sidow, Head of Marketing Research at App.
The revenue of the mobile games sector in 2021 reached $90 billion. The leaders in the number of downloads were casual and hyper-casual games, in which there is no or almost no plot, and video design is minimal.
The top 3 most popular games in the world include Count Masters, Project Makeover and Bridge Race.
In Russia, among the games are DOP 2: Delete One Part, Going Balls and Phone Case DIY.
Earlier, App Annie presented its forecast for 2022.
Among the main trends of the next year, the company’s analysts called the growth of the number of users of TikTok to 1.5 billion, the growth of the popularity of generation Z financial applications, such as applications for investors Robinhood, as well as the further increase in the popularity of metaverse mobile games.

Russians warned about a new scheme of fraudsters
The attackers began to look for new manoeuvres for fraud in video messages.
This is reported by “Izvestia” with reference to experts.
According to Zaur Abutalimov, Ivideon’s product director, the main danger associated with the proliferation of video communications is dipfeiki.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real recordings involving the victim.
Thanks to this neural network, it is possible to accurately reproduce the characteristics of a person's behavior.
Abutalimov added that using a dipfeik, attackers can call friends of the victim via video link or create a video featuring a copy of the person for the purpose of blackmailing.
“Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a savvy attacker can place people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios,” the expert said.
Leading Varonis system engineer Alexander Wetkol, in turn, noted that psychologically people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video-based technologies.
David, I'll add.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized the fact that I bought all this in a small town, where the local mentality did not allow to dye and walk in short skirts, show stockings and pantyhose on the legs.
It's a province, but there was such a thing in the store.
In the big cities and Muslim women dyed, and the beds showed.
So in Dushanbe, it is a big city, the capital of the republic.
There are a lot of fashionistas, but there are no cosmetics.
Here are five steps to help you avoid diabetes.
Blood sugar problems are some of the most common in the world.
However, some do not attach much importance to this, and in vain.
Diabetes can eventually lead to serious complications and even death.
Preventive measures play a major role in preventing the formation of diseases.
Thus, doctors recommend changing the drinking regime - reducing the number of various drinks and switching to ordinary water positively affect the metabolism.
Sweet foods raise blood sugar levels to a dangerous level when consumed in excess.
Therefore, the first step towards a healthy lifestyle is to stop buying sweets and store them at home.
The appearance of the disease is affected not only by improper nutrition, but also habits.
To reduce the risk of diabetes, you need to move a lot.
Experts advise to adhere to a low-carb diet.
Such a diet will not only help to reduce weight, but also protect against sharp fluctuations in the level of sugar.
To protect against diabetes, you need to eat a lot of fiber.
Food fiber fills the stomach and thus contributes to the emergence of a feeling of satiety, the release of digestive juices and increased absorption of food.

Dr. Pavlova told about the "migraine weekend" in workaholics
There are several factors that can lead to worsening of health on weekends.
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working weekdays is often the "migraine of the weekend", said the famous endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior researcher at the Faculty of Fundamental Medicine of MSU, scientific head of the clinic of System medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram channel.
According to her, especially often this affects workaholics, who have a headache, brokenness and weakness on the weekend.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to accumulated fatigue for a week, there are quite a lot of objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
Over the weekend, our lives are changing.
“We sleep long, lie on the couch all day, most likely we eat more, and drink less,” the doctor argued.
Because of overeating and lack of water, it is heavy and broken.”
An additional role is played by the late rise.
So, if you get up three hours later than usual, there will be a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which of the factors plays a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended to monitor what changes the most during the weekend.

South African scientists claim low efficacy of Pfizer vaccine against "Omicron"
In South Africa declared the low effectiveness of the vaccine Pfizer against "Omicron"
South African scientists conducted a study and reported the low effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
According to estimates, it (the level of neutralization of "omicron") corresponds to the (level) of vaccine effectiveness of 22.5 percent against infection with symptoms, which is why... the vaccine's ability to protect against infection is questioned, the text of the study published on the MedRxiv portal says.
At the same time, experts clarified that the drug can save from the severe course of the disease.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of the coronavirus could trigger a new wave of pandemics in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much hidden sugar is in common foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Its excess in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cause cardiovascular and oncological diseases.
Consumers should take into account that under the unfamiliar word in the composition of the product can be indicated hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
On the label can be represented several dozen names, in fact, designating sugar.
Some of the most common and common names are glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (sugar derived from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), melasse (black molasses), agave syrup, etc.
These are all simple carbohydrates that belong to mono- and disaccharides, and they can be not only in confectionery, but also in ketchup, in doctor's sausage, bread, etc.
As stated in Roskachestvo, the most effective way to reduce sugar consumption is to consume whole and unprocessed products, as well as pay attention to the label and many different names for sugar.
Different types of sugar differ in taste, but no matter how the ingredient in the product is called - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it still remains sugar.
Calculate the exact amount of sugar is not easy, as it is necessary to take into account not only the amount of sugar specified by the manufacturer on the package, but also the fact that vegetables, fruits, etc. initially contain a certain amount of sugar.
Thus, the total amount of sugar can be much higher than indicated on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: gas will lose importance for Germany in 25 years
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that gas imports are losing importance for Germany as the country continues the transition to decarbonization of the economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045, becoming a climate-neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the issue of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role," the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to remain committed to ensuring that Ukraine transports Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is important for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which it recorded Berlin’s support for Ukraine’s energy transformation.
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is ongoing.
According to the minister, in the framework of coalition negotiations and discussion of the coalition treaty, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also pointed out that the pipeline is not yet "compliant with the requirements" of the European Union.

Hackers Hacked India's Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers have hacked the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The attackers managed to publish a fake message.
It was reported that India has allegedly recognized Bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country has already purchased cryptocurrency.
Modi's office was asked to ignore the new messages.
Representatives of the prime minister said that Twitter quickly reacted - access to the account was restored.
The Indian Prime Minister’s website was already hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia, a majority voted against independence.
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on 12 December, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, the majority of New Caledonian residents voted during a referendum against the independence of their territory.
At the same time, the level of participation in this third vote was significantly lower than in the two previous ones.
According to preliminary results published by local authorities, 3.51% (2,755) voted in favour of New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75,762) voted against.
The turnout was 43.90%, with a total of more than 80,000 New Caledonian residents taking part in the elections.
France-Presse said the outcome of the election "did not leave room for doubt" as independence supporters urged voters not to participate in the vote.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed it on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic in the archipelago prevents a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and October 2020.
In 2018, 56.7% of residents voted against independence, in 2020 - 53.3%.
The separatists said they did not recognize the results of the last vote and would challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, at the <0xC3><0x89>lysée Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron should speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia’s independence has largely revived the last weeks of the presidential campaign in France.
Several presidential candidates have spoken in favor of the territory remaining part of France, as it is “the last region of the European Union’s presence in the Pacific.”
“New Caledonia must remain French,” said Zemmour.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecress, who at the end of October published a column in Le Figaro, urging the Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take a position, “because it is not his responsibility.”
However, the president added, “France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia.”
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized the article on relations between Russia and the United States
Readers of The Wall Street Journal criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell, in which he described his vision of relations between Russia and the United States.
The author expressed concern that the West is allegedly sacrificing Ukraine to Russia.
In his article, he convinces readers of the danger that comes from Moscow, and made a number of offensive statements to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In the end, Hartwell called on Western countries to "act as a united front against Russia."
Readers of the WSJ expressed their disagreement with the position of the American professor.
"There is quite a lot of false information in this article," RIA Novosti quoted one of the readers as saying.
“Europe is not ours to lose, and Ukraine is not our land.
“The United States and NATO allies will never enter a nuclear war with Russia for the sake of Ukraine,” he said.
Patches can also be used in the area of the lips.
Used in the production of Dearboo Peach & Hibiscus Brightening Hydrogel Eye Patch, the hydrogel is a high-tech polymer that provides increased absorption and skin transfer of highly concentrated natural plant essence, tightly adheres to the skin and gives a feeling of freshness.
When transferring nutrients to the skin, hydrogel minimizes the concomitant loss of moisture and causes the essence to penetrate into the deep layers of the skin.

Earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred in the area of the Kuril Islands
An earthquake of magnitude 5.2 occurred near the Kuril island of Shikotan.
It is noted that the epicenter of the earthquake was 231.8 km northeast of the city of Severo-Kurilsk.
The focus was at a depth of 92.5 km.
Earlier, seismologists recorded an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 in Peru, during which ten people were injured.

Ukraine will start to produce a new generation of jet drones
At the new Ukrainian-Turkish plant will begin to create jet unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) type ANKA.
This was announced on December 11 by the freelance adviser of the head of the office of the Ukrainian President Alexei Arestovich.
That is, they are able to act against air objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aviation.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of Turkish avionics: the body and the like,” he said.
Commenting on the main features of ANKA devices, Arestovich said that we are talking about reactive, not piston UAVs.
According to him, this is a new generation of drones after Bayraktar, which exceeds it "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, concluded Arestovic.
ANKA was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
Earlier, the Ukrainian General Staff classified the data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during the military operations of the joint forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that the construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones had begun in the country.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Defense Ministry signed an agreement on the construction of a center in the Kiev region, where they will conduct training of personnel, as well as testing and maintenance of the Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the office of the Ukrainian leader called this memorandum “a big real step forward”.
Two lions escaped from the airport.
Lions fled at Singapore’s Changi Airport.
This is reported by the Straits Times.
Two predators managed to get out of the container with seven lions, arrived on one of the planes.
It remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the runaway lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not move away from him because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival at the airport of employees of the organization Mandai Wildlife Group, which knows all Singapore zoos.
They immobilized the lions with darts with a tranquilizer and plan to deliver them to a quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, the lion fled from the owner and walked through the streets of the city.
The same day, the animal voluntarily returned home, people were not injured.
Experts warn about the threat of cancer due to vitamin B9
Research suggests that an excess of vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
This was reported by the Daily Express.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who do not experience folic acid deficiency are less likely to get some types of cancer, in particular, colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose on the contrary contributes to the growth of cancer cells.
University of Alabama Birmingham professor, dietitian Beth Kitchin advises to monitor the amount of folic acid consumed during the day.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms per day.
The risk of cancer increases only if you significantly deviate from this figure in a larger or smaller direction.
Kitchin recommends not to take vitamin B9 in tablets without the recommendation of a doctor, be sure to monitor the dosage and avoid flakes with milk and other foods that contain folic acid.
Earlier, nutrition consultant Rachel Fine called folic acid a substance that slows down aging.
Since it is found, among other things, in avocados, Fine recommended that men over 50 years of age eat this fruit more often.
In the UK, by April, about 75,000 people could die due to omicron-stamp
Forecasts by British scientists show that due to the spread of the omicron-stam coronavirus in the next five months in England can die up to 75,000 people, if not tightening the restrictive measures in the winter.
This was reported by the newspaper The Guardian with reference to the study of experts of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of specialists, who are part of the scientific advisory group on emergencies under the British Cabinet, by April 2022 in the country will record at least 25,000 deaths due to the strain of omicron, and in total will be hospitalized about 175,000 patients.
At the peak of the disease rate, hospitals will receive more than 2,000 infections daily.
“Serious measures to combat the coronavirus may be needed to prevent the National Health Service from overloading if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant, and existing vaccines cannot rule out infection,” LSHTM mathematician Rosanna Barnard said in a statement.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency reported that if the rate of omicrone-stamp spread remains at its current level, by the end of the year, the country will detect about 1 million cases of infection.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become the dominant strain in the United Kingdom.
There are currently 1,898 cases of coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been identified in the past 24 hours.
At the same time, on December 9, the head of the British Ministry of Health Sajid Javid indicated that in reality this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.

The demand for superyachts increased by a quarter in the world
This year’s superyacht construction and next year’s orders are breaking all records in the world, despite calls to reduce the hydrocarbon footprint and combat climate change.
In the world register of ships, the number of ordered yachts amounted to 1,200 units - a quarter more than last year.
In an era of fighting the effects of climate change to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress for 50 million pounds or more will not decrease.
However, they are becoming more and more.
This year, 25% more ships were ordered than in the previous year.
Brokers say that there has been no such hype in the market for 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of being infected on land and prefer to escape a pandemic aboard their own ship.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
If earlier all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the absolute majority of them work remotely, and negotiations are held on zoom.
Broker Will Christie told the newspaper that the shipyards accept orders for new yachts for 2025 and later.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
“People just crave freedom, and the super rich could afford it,” he says.
In Western society, many criticize such behavior of the rich and call it decadent.
The wealthy, sociologists say, do not want to understand that in times of deprivation of space travel, living on yachts or flying on their own planes are irritating to society, as the elite do not want to share the responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and suggest introducing new taxes and rules for the super-rich, although they understand that with such money mobility, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, impressive is only the number of super-yachts ordered, but also their characteristics.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length above 100 meters.
Norwegian billionaire Rekke is building an 183-metre-long REV Ocean yacht.
Once on the water, it will be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht has a "moon pool" as well as a submarine designed to explore the sea depths.
On existing super-yachts, it became common for helicopter platforms, open-air cinemas, and on some of them, such as on the yacht of the wrestler McGregor - a platform for martial arts.
But it has a symbolic meaning, given that the world’s multi-billionaires are just over 2,000 people.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emission footprint of billionaires is thousands of times larger than the average inhabitant of the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, then the largest polluter of the planet Roman Abramovich is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases that got into the atmosphere in 2018.
At the same time, two-thirds of the emission track is attached to his yacht Eclipse length of 162.5 meters.
Even if the owner of the yacht is not on board, the team continues to poison the planet.
The owner can call the captain and give the command to drive the yacht, for example, from the Mediterranean Sea to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners don’t evoke other people’s sympathy when they, like Australia’s richest woman, Gina Reinhard, who owns the mines on the continent, complain via YouTube that their giant ships have no place to dock.
It is also difficult to understand her call to build marinas for ships under 50 meters.
A dangerous weekly dose of alcohol has been identified, leading to the development of bowel cancer
American scientists have determined how much alcohol per week increases the risk of cancer.
This is reported by the Daily Express.
Experts concluded that the consumption of four or more servings of alcoholic beverages per week is associated with an increased risk of developing oncology.
At the same time, the likelihood of developing the disease increases with an increase in the amount of alcohol consumed.
Moreover, moderately drinking men have a higher risk of bowel cancer than women.
The exact cause of the development of this type of oncology, scientists can not determine, noting only that certain factors lead to a harmful process for the body.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old child
Many, or rather all, dog lovers are sure that these creatures are very smart.
But even they don’t know how much four-legged pets are actually developed.
Over the years, biologists have conducted various experiments to find out for sure how intelligence is developed in animals.
Although the dog’s vocabulary is not as extensive as that of a human, a new study suggests that the dog can respond consistently to 89 words or phrases.
The works of scientists were published in the journal Sciencealert.
Dogs can not play chess or write poetry, they do not understand anything in politics, economics and art, while they often manage to fool their masters.
Representatives of some breeds, experts believe, show better results in understanding the words of the human language, but statistical data for accurate conclusions is not enough.
So, some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking, and the ability to learn is not inferior to a two-year-old child.

In Ukraine, prepared for the trade of the United States and Russia
The United States and Russia will “negotiate” about Ukraine’s accession to NATO, said analyst Alexander Kochetkov in his article for the publication “Glavred”.
In his opinion, Washington and Moscow in the near future plan to continue negotiations on the guarantees of the United States that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of the American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries "to enter anywhere".
If you are offered something obviously unacceptable, well, for example, to sell a close relative into sexual slavery, you will not be bargaining, but just send the offeror.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a bidding process," the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
“Preparation is carried out covertly, quickly and immediately proceed to offensive actions, and do not wait for the group to be detected and deployed counter-forces,” he said.
China stimulates the development of the railway industry
Advanced Chinese technologies attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the China International Rail Transport and Equipment Exhibition 2021, held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technologies developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allow trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical faults, said Hou Zhaowen, a spokesman for the company.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with these technologies, which will ensure increased reliability and efficiency of the rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its exports of rail vehicles, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing “Chinese speed.”
In May of this year, the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd descended the first two-story high-speed electric trains developed in China, intended for export to Europe.
With a maximum working speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the test operation of the subway train developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey began.
The train will run on the metro line connecting the center of Istanbul with the airport of the city.
The metro line will be opened next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey at a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
“The Chinese railway equipment manufacturing industry is one of the industries with the highest level of innovation and the strongest international innovation competitiveness,” said Feng Yaosian, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
“This industry represents the main competitive advantage of Chinese production of high-end equipment in the global market,” said Feng Yaosian.
After more than 60 years of hard work, carrying out a number of independent research and development, China has established an advanced system of production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of auxiliary equipment and with large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaosian, the country ranks first in terms of the level of electrification of railways and operational mileage on high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Candidate of Biological Sciences Semen Golosheikin in an interview with Radio Sputnik listed the early signs of dementia.
According to him, signs of future dementia can be forgetfulness, as well as a number of moderate cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, planning, and a decrease in the level of abstract thinking.
There is currently a debate that hearing loss can be both an early manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease and one of the risk factors for its occurrence, the specialist said.
Golosheikin stressed that the causes of dementia can be neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer’s disease and cerebral atherosclerosis are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that today doctors do not know effective ways to treat dementia.
Therefore, it is necessary to start its prevention in time.
According to him, learning foreign languages and active communication will help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
Also, the WHO recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regularly training cognitive skills with the help of games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and expediency are still discussed in the scientific community," said Golosheikin.
“The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking,” said Golosheikin.
Earlier, the charity for the study of dementia in the UK said that the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
Doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.
The first alarming sign can be considered vision problems, due to which the patient acquires difficulties in recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia, experts called aphasia - a condition where a person can not find the right words to convey what he wants to say.
Neurologist demanded to send Saakashvili for treatment abroad
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychonervous treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of the medical council created under the Georgian Ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili] neurological status is leading in his illness.
Stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character," the expert said, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to special rehabilitation.
"This is what we call neurorehabilitation and psychonervous rehabilitation, a possibility we did not find in Georgia," Toidze said, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began sabotaging medical care after prison officials had disciplinary action against him.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself in his former rights.
Alexandra, "Do you take money for this too?" - I wonder where these people come from...

Or are we so holy that we eat prana?
There's another side to the medal.
These people are parasites on the body of society.
They do not work, do not pay taxes, live on benefits and at the expense of relatives.
At the same time, they receive full medical care.
How many mouths can a worker feed?
We feed all the alcoholics, the drug addicts, who also lost their health because of their stupidity.
Then we are surprised by the extension of the retirement age.
These amounts could be spent on the treatment of really sick people.

Protests against COVID-passports in Spain
In the Spanish cities of Barcelona and Valencia protest against the mandatory certificate of vaccination against COVID-19, reports the agency Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants in the action amounted to about 3,000 people.
In Barcelona, COVID passports have become mandatory for trips to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and night entertainment venues.
Many demonstrators came to the action without masks.
With slogans on their posters, they accused the state of totalitarianism and called for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
Protesters in the city declared a medical dictatorship, and the vaccination was called an experiment.
In Spain, since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus infection have been identified, more than 88,000 patients have died.
In Russia, it is also planned to impose restrictions on the unvaccinated.
Bills on a unified system of QR-codes were submitted by the government to the State Duma on November 12.
It is assumed that the Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, catering and retail facilities with the presentation of either a certificate of vaccination or a transferred disease, or a medical discharge from vaccination.
The same rules will be established for travel on trains and planes.

A Cool Rise: How the Chinese Become Skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international resorts in the country
In China, they hope that the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, which will collect President Xi Jinping's designated 1 trillion yuan, but also contribute to the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiakou, located near the site of the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular with the Chinese.
In addition to the construction of infrastructure in the region, greening works are also carried out: workers plant trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
In many regions of China, where resorts are located, including Zhangjiakou, there are problems with snow.
The main task for the long term is to provide a comfortable and interesting holiday in Chinese resorts, so that all newcomers become regulars.
However, this is still a long way off.
Games Adviser Justin Downs says the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition since his last visit in 2007.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in the winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, one of them.
Despite major changes, it will take many years to create a ski culture here, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions have yet to actively develop and create the necessary infrastructure for recreation there.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the venues for the Winter Olympics.
He notes that in recent years there has been a boom in winter sports tourism.
Two years ago, a high-speed railway ran from Beijing to Chunli, now none of the locals suffer without work.
More and more stores are opening in the country, selling clothing and equipment for winter sports.
On the slopes open points of common meals with dishes of national cuisine.
Taiwan now even has a COVID-19 testing station.
China aims to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and resorts and equipment must reach world-class levels.
More than 500 million people in the world could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people in the world could be plunged into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has hampered human progress on universal access to health services, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the 12 December International Day for Universal Health Coverage, WHO and the World Health Organization have published two complementary reports.
In them, they noted that the pandemic led to disruptions in the provision of medical services, caused excessive tension in health care systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, immunization coverage has decreased, mortality from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) said the pandemic caused “the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment.”
This situation pushes more than 500 million people “into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pocket.”
In October, UN Secretary-General Ant<0xC3><0xB3>nio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic has plunged more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people with little or no social support.

Taiwan's minister suspended from broadcast at 'Summit for Democracy' at White House request
Taiwan’s Minister of Digital Technology Audrey Tan’s speech at a panel discussion during the U.S.-organized “Summit for Democracy” was moved to video-free mode, according to a video recording of the summit on YouTube.
Reuters, citing sources, said the image was disabled at the request of the White House.
According to them, the reason was a map on which Taiwan was allocated a separate color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map shown by Ms. Tan was drawn up by the South African non-governmental organization CIVICUS and ranked the countries of the world in terms of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", while China, North Korea, Laos and Vietnam were highlighted in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture on her side was replaced with a screenshot with the note that the views of the participants in the discussion “do not necessarily express the position of the US government.”
The People's Republic of China was not invited to the "Summit for Democracy".
Reuters sources note that the map, demonstrated by the Taiwanese minister, could go against the “one China” policy pursued by Washington.
One of the sources of the agency said that after the demonstration of the map, the U.S. National Security Council angryly contacted the State Department, accusing him of what he showed Taiwan as a separate country.
The Summit for Democracy, organized by Washington, was held from 9 to 10 December with the participation of representatives of 110 countries and territories, as well as civil associations and charities.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the “zero day” of the summit, the Nobel Peace Prize winner, editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money obtained through corruption would be donated to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried an "anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

Those arriving in cities where land checkpoints are located must pass at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.

The Foreign Ministry told about the “sad conclusion” in relations between Russia and the United States
Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia assessed the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long path of interaction led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There is one-sided negative predictability, but in terms of some prospect of improving relations, everything is completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from the long road we have taken with the current administration, with Trump, and with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday,” the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problems are related to the desire of the United States to impose on Russia approaches on many issues.
The Deputy Foreign Minister added that he would not risk to give optimistic forecasts about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect a change in Washington’s position.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress has been made.
At the same time, Russia calls on the United States to take a responsible approach in matters of international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and the Americans will listen to the arguments of common sense.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said that Moscow is ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns about the danger of vaccination with a nasal drug from COVID outside hospitals
Those vaccinated with a nasal vaccine against COVID-19 may develop allergies and need medical help, so the first points for vaccination with this drug should not be organized in airports and shopping centers.
This was reported by TASS virologist, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the laboratory of bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology of Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It is easier to organize nasal vaccination points in airports and shopping centers, but I would do it at first only in medical institutions.
The fact that there is a chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine, it is small, but it is desirable that a person after that sit next to the doctor's office.
Doctors have special sets of antiallergic drugs, which act literally in a minute or two, which sometimes is very necessary,” said Netesov.
According to the virologist, it will be possible to think about vaccination in shopping centers when experience in the use of the drug is accumulated.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it gets on the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
At the same time, there is a possibility that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the vaccinated person with nasal congestion is soaked after injection.

The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3137 people.

Peskov warned about the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Press Secretary of the President of the Russian Federation Dmitry Peskov commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in case of the continuation of “aggressive actions” against Ukraine, including due to the alleged “invasion” on the territory of the country.
“It is impossible to impose some restrictions against Russia and not to experience suffering on your own,” a Kremlin official said on Russia 1 television.
Peskov says this is “understanding by everyone in the world.”
Earlier it was reported that the United States considers the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will be aimed at complicating the conversion of rubles into dollars against Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Herman Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonian people reject independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of the participants refused to leave France.
This was reported on December 12 by the French TV channel BFM.TV.
96.5% of voters opposed independence.
Supported independence from France 3.51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the South Pacific.
Cancelled the results of 2.99% of the newsletters.
The voter turnout on this day was very low: about 55% of the archipelago’s inhabitants came to the sites.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum because of the coronavirus.
Paris has refused to postpone the date of the referendum.
In October 2020, the people of New Caledonia voted in a referendum against independence from France.
In 2018, a referendum on independence was held in the region.
The majority of the inhabitants supported the location of the archipelago in France.
New Caledonia is located almost 20,000 kilometers from the mainland of France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory is granted a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia allows the region to hold a two-year vote on its independence.

WHO Preliminary Considers Omicron Less Dangerous Than Delta
The World Health Organization (WHO) provisionally believes that "omicron" is less dangerous than the delta strain of the coronavirus.
At the same time, there is evidence of a decrease in the effectiveness of vaccines in the disease with a new variant of COVID-19.
As of December 9, Omicron was registered in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic protein profile of the Omicron strain suggest a decrease in the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and transmission of the variant.
According to preliminary findings from South Africa, it is assumed that it (the "severity of the disease" - ed.) may be less severe than the "delta", - said in a technical message to the WHO.
The organization notes that so far, all registered cases of infection with "Omicron" in the EU are easy or asymptomatic.
At the same time, the new strain, according to preliminary data, spreads faster than the "delta".
Two cases of omicron-stam infection have been reported in Russia.
They were “previously immunized,” the Gamaleya Center reported.
The head of Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova said that so far there is no reliable evidence that the new variant of the coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

In Ukraine called four scenarios for Zelensky
Former Verkhovna Rada deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
In his opinion, the head of state can remain without the support of the West, as well as, perhaps, will compromise on the Donbass.
About this on Sunday, December 12, Denisenko said in the publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called the "perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will stop supporting key Western countries, having reached an agreement on the future of the country without its participation.
Such developments will contribute to the deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
“Parallelly, prices for the key goods that we traditionally export are decreasing <0x3C>...> internal protests and the confrontation of the authorities with the key FPG (financial-industrial groups),” the ex-parliamentary added.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario for the development of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the event of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Due to this state of affairs, the leadership of Ukraine can make compromises on the Donbass, as a result of which a confrontation within the country is possible.
At the end of the summer, Zelensky’s position will weaken, the probability of such a situation, according to the former MP, is up to 50-55%.
The third option for the development of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between the population groups that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is likely to seize control of the power bloc and the implementation of “populist initiatives”.
During such a variant of the crisis, Zelensky will begin “reformatting the power,” Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky’s transformation into a “father of the nation.”
This can lead to an event that will be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to provoke a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine," Denisenko said.
Such a variant of the development of the situation is possible as a result of a natural disaster, man-made disaster or aggressive actions of Russia, said the ex-deputy.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an “attack” on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it is the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that are increasing military activity at the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, the poll data of the sociological group "Rating" showed that the rating of the Ukrainian president fell to a record low, amounting to 19.3%.
This is the lowest figure since his election as head of state.
Analysts have forecasted a situation in which in the case of the next presidential election, only 21.8% would vote for Zelensky, while 14.5% would vote for the ex-president of the country, Petro Poroshenko.
Of all the respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

The poet arrested for the action on Red Square: "For the quote of Evtushenko 10 days are given, here she is, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, the 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster on which the hashtag #poetvrossiya was written.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtushenko.
Alexander was drafted a protocol on the administrative article on the repeated violation of the order of holding a public action.
The first time he was detained on January 23 in Pushkin Square, at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny.
“The goal was to attract attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and just as little hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag,” Alexander explains.
We contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of the detention and to reveal in more detail the message of his message.
How have you been treated by the police this time and before?
What was asked in the department, how did they comment on your action?
This time, the staff were more correct, the detention was as polite as possible, no matter how funny it sounded in some context of the word.
In Pushkinskaya took <0xD0><0x9E><0xD0><0x9C><0xD0><0x9E><0xD0><0x9D><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xB2><0xD1><0x81><0xD0><0xBA><0xD0><0xB8> and took hard.
They asked me standard questions about motives.
When they heard, in principle, they looked, if not approvingly, they understood.
With the exception of the monkey blown on all four sides, everything was extremely correct, but I knew what I was going to do.
And if, after the action under this hashtag, they start writing their poems, at least a few people, I will not sit these 10 days in vain.
Maxim, according to the protocol, speak alone at least in the language of the Tumba-Yumba tribe.
And at public and official events, they speak the language of others, so that everyone can understand what happened in the Bundestag on September 25, 2001, or in their native language through an interpreter.
It is a protocol and nothing more, by the way, Angela Merkel speaks perfectly Russian and nevertheless resorts to the help of an interpreter.

Researchers have told how potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders
The study showed that potatoes are rich in vitamins and micronutrients that contribute to improving blood circulation and lowering cholesterol levels.
The root crop contains B vitamins, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavin, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body’s systems to function.
In addition, potatoes help in the fight against age-related disorders.
Due to the high content of cloves, it is useful for the gastrointestinal tract, and with regular use can also help in the prevention of hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, for the greatest benefit, the root crop is better to simmer or cook, rather than fry in oil.
Earlier, The Daily Express warned that potatoes can be dangerous for diabetics, as well as other foods with a high glycemic index.
These are carbohydrate-containing foods that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sweet soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal auxiliary farms and an increase in processing capacity.
According to market participants, the shortage of products at the moment will be able to replace only imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from the release of "Yandex"
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, the rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirated runet sites and most of them ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, CEO of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive thanks to the regular change of the domain name, he adds.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in the search engine of both "Yandex" and Google, you can see pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of squid" and "Tenderness" directed by Anna Melikyan - the original series of the largest in Russia video service ivi (included in AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in the search engine release, you can see the animated novelty "Encanto", but judging by the quality of the video, this is the so-called screen (a pirated copy of the film shot in the cinema).
On Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, the TV series "Universe. 10 years later" of the TNT channel (included in "Gazprom-media") is available.

Estonian scientists will be looking for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the current camera said on Sunday.
The goal of the five-year mission is to assess the habitability of the Venusian clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed tools to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Until now, it has been assumed that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, are too acidic for life to exist there, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
During the third mission, a sample from Venus should arrive.
Assume that if we find life there, the main question will be whether it is similar to earthly or different.
If it is very similar, it will be obvious that life on earth did not begin on Earth.
If it is different, then perhaps it will be more likely that life originated on Earth," - said the head of the Estonian project "Venus Life Finder" Mihkel Pajusalu.

Metaversents will change the Russian business
The topic of the metaverse became popular this fall, when Mark Zuckerberg announced the transformation of Facebook into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
Thus, business in Russia, as well as around the world, will invest in the creation of their own metaverses and their subsequent monetization.
Metaverses should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend to create remote interactions in a pandemic, because people are tired of separation and restrictions.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operational models to them.
Third, they are a logical continuation of the trend of digitalization of assets, when any rights, securities, works of art and even money are transferred to the digital format.
You’re right, changing your diet is a conscious process.

The British economist could not give a forecast for 2022
The British economist Jim O'Neill failed to give a forecast for 2022, because, in his opinion, such attempts will turn out to be a failure.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and in second place - inflation, he believes.
O’Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price hike was temporary or not.
Even before the pandemic, it was clear that “the world of the endless generosity of central banks had already outlived itself” and it was time to return to a relationship where inflation-based interest rates would correlate with expected GDP growth.
O’Neill noted that against the backdrop of the pandemic, the continuation of ultra-soft economic policies may, according to some experts, lead to a new surge in inflation.
In addition, attention should be paid to the issue of productivity growth, as well as the increase in poverty and climate change, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, Mikhail Shulgin, head of the global research department of Opening Investments, said that positive expectations for the dollar exchange rate for 2022 remain, with the growth potential being less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin called the Fed’s monetary policy, the dynamics of oil prices and fears amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Forced to agree.

The Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country’s GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, the Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, according to statistics of the Russian Automotive Market Research Agency (NAPI).
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that such an amount is comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) for 2020.
In terms of revenues in the Russian market, the Korean brand Kia leads.
For 10 months of this year, he managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The related Kia brand Hyundai growth is even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279.3 billion rubles.
At the leading positions, this brand and the increase in the weighted average price of the car - for the year, Hyundai has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - more expensive dynamics was only at Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales volumes of Korean brands increased not so much: according to statistics of the Committee of Automobile Manufacturers of the Association of European Business in Russia, in quantitative terms, Kia sold 9.4% more cars in the same period than a year earlier.
Hyundai is almost 12%.
Closes the top three in terms of sales in monetary terms Japanese Toyota - for cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 275,5 billion rubles, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
The Japanese are followed by Mercedes-Benz with an indicator of 266.1 billion rubles (+75%) - the German premium brand has increased both the sales volume (by 37%), and the weighted average price of the car (by almost 28%, to 8.2 million rubles).
“Mercedes-Benz simultaneously has a good growth in sales and weighted average price – more, for example, than BMW – hence a greater growth in financial capacity,” said Tatiana Arabaji, CEO of NAPI.
In terms of sales growth, Chinese brands are showing fantastic performance, which has also significantly increased their financial capacity this year.”
Russian Lada in terms of growth in revenues shows the average market indicators (plus 28%), for cars of this brand Russians spent for 10 months 229,4 billion rubles.
At the level of last year's financial capacity are the companies, the sales of which in pieces in 2021 fell: in particular, Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ and in general minus - for 10 months, the Russians spent on SUVs and pickups of this brand 12 billion rubles against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of automotive components and interruptions in production, covering the entire world automotive industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "AvtoVAZ" increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last rise (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
They regularly rewrite prices for their products and other car manufacturers.
The volumes of the Russian car market in monetary terms will increase further - in addition to the shortage of cars, inflation contributes to this, as well as the desire of automakers to recover past losses, experts say.
In the context of car shortages, I think many automakers have even been able to partially pass on to the consumer the costs of past periods, which they could not put into the price of cars before.
says the analyst of "VTB Capital" on the automobile industry Vladimir Bespalov. -
I believe that financially, automakers are feeling very good right now, maintaining a high margin of sales.”
An indirect indicator of this is the rate of growth in the cost of cars, which are observed during 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert said.
In the long term, the market will grow both in quantitative terms and in monetary terms, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, Bespalov predicts.
With the increase in supply, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow next year, even if the growth of the cost of cars slows down, automakers will be able to get their income at the expense of volumes, says independent consultant on the automotive industry Sergey Burgazliev.
Given the increased demand and insufficient supply, now automakers are trying to get the greatest profit from every car sold, notes Burgazliev.
An increase in the volume of production of machines is not expected at least in the next six months, while in Russia the excitement is also heated by the uncertainty of citizens in the future.
Against the background of the current market situation, cars turned out to be a good object for investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, now you can sell more expensive than the original cost, the expert notes.
Biden spoke about the transfer of the U.S. military to Ukraine in the event of a Russian invasion
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending U.S. troops to Ukraine in the event of a “invasion” of Russia.
This statement was made by U.S. President Joe Biden.
"There has never been such a plan," the White House chief said in response to a journalist's question about whether the United States had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that in the event of an escalation of the situation around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
At the same time, he stressed that the United States and NATO have no obligations to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of an escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally for the defense of Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will transfer forces to Eastern European NATO countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We will have to send more U.S. and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries against which we have a sacred obligation to protect them from any attack from Russia," Biden said.
Earlier, the press Secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention to invade the territory of Ukraine.
At the same time, he pointed out that Moscow sees the problem in the combat use of drones delivered by Kiev by Turkey, as well as in the fact that “American weapons are approaching our territory.”

As the regular friendly meetings of the presidents of Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkey show, in my opinion, you are, to put it mildly, not on the subject.
