The Republican Party's strategy against Obama's re-election
Republican leaders have justified their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center, however, calls such fraud a myth, saying that election fraud is less common in the U.S. than the number of people who die after lightning strikes.
In the last 10 years, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of voter fraud in the United States.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. has a responsibility to organize federal elections.
And in this spirit, most U.S. governments have been promulgating new laws since 2009 that make the process of electing or enrolling in the electoral roll more difficult.
This phenomenon has seen a surge since the November 2010 elections, during which 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states have been added.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills restricting voting rights in 41 states were submitted.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws limit the period for early elections, invalidate the right to register on the electoral list on the day of the elections and remove the right to vote from citizens with registration in the criminal register.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state had required voters to submit a photo ID.
The first state to introduce this requirement was Indiana.
The Constitution of the Indian Act was confirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2008.
Republican authorities rushed to extend this process to other states.
In the past two years, they have supported draft laws in 34 states to force voters to submit photo IDs.
It should be noted that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card, such as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not own an identity card with a photo issued by the government of their state.
In addition, about five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity card.
In addition, obtaining the required identity card often costs more than a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect mainly young people, members of minorities and low-income people.
25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with income under $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 therefore do not have the required photo ID.
And that's not all.
Students who are known as voters for their inclination to democratic candidates are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their school in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of hunting or fishing clubs who elect rather republican candidates to use the cards issued by these clubs in elections.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship in elections.
The first such request was made by Arizona.
Since 2011, about 12 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the number of votes cast by the Hispanic minority.
It should be noted that two out of three Hispanics prefer a democratic party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers in eight states approved laws that abolish voter registration on election day.
In addition, they have restricted the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general elections, campaigns for voter registration helped to register about 10 million people.
However, measures taken after 2009 caused a 17% drop in voter registration in 2010 compared to 2006.
Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the period for early elections.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, African-Americans accounted for 33% of the electorate who voted in advance, even though African-American voters in that state were only 13%.
It was the same with the Spaniards.
They constituted only 11% of all voters, but 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
On the other hand, whites, who made up 76% of all voters, made up only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have very strongly opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
The Democratic governors blocked several bills with their veto.
In order to suspend the most controversial laws, the Attorney General of the United States even intervened.
Some of the damage has been reduced.
For example, laws requiring the presentation of an identity card with a photo were adopted by only 16 of the 34 states.
However, the newly introduced rules will undeniably complicate the exercise of voting rights in 2012.
Democratic critics primarily talk about the bias of the approved laws and consider them an obvious attempt to influence the outcome of the 2012 elections in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states where these laws were passed represent 171 of the 270 votes in the electorate needed to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain today: these new provisions will have an adverse impact on electoral participation.
In this sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Detection of prostate cancer: to undergo an examination or not?
The PSA test sometimes produced erroneous results that were incorrectly negative or even incorrectly positive, leading to unnecessary medical interventions.
All this further increased the hesitation of men who were already so reluctant to go to the examination at all.
To be examined or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
Studies conducted in the USA showed a high level of contamination between the individual groups tested, so it is difficult to interpret these results and make valuable recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a difference in mortality between patients who underwent the examination and those who did not.
This study also showed after a 12-year interval that those who did not go for the examination had a 30 to 40% higher risk of metastasis.
Therefore, I recommend testing from the age of 50 or from the age of 40 if your direct relative had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive types of cancer and such types that are intractable.
Therefore, it is necessary to correctly explain to the patient the degree of danger of his type of cancer, to offer him possible alternatives, not necessarily to treat prostate cancer, which does not have an impact on life in the long term, and in these cases to focus on active supervision of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their type of cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
Rather, we will suggest them to carry out active supervision, and in case of disease progression, we will offer them treatment.
Increasingly and with greater precision, we define criteria that help in deciding which species to treat and which not.
However, I recommend that the examination be carried out.
However, it is important to have an interview with a doctor and determine whether it is appropriate to undergo an examination or not.
In collaboration with the International Urological Society, Movember has developed a tool to assess the pros and cons of PSA testing.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle procedure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of healthy lifestyle principles seems to be the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is estimated that if everyone ate healthy and moved enough, up to 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If everyone stopped smoking, this figure would rise to at least 50%,” André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Research Society, said in a statement.
In contrast, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Some percentages are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Research Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, even as the number of smokers declines.
Cigarettes account for 85% of lung cancer cases.
They are also a risk factor for several others.
This is extremely harmful to human health.
“There are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” André Beaulieu said.
10 years after a smoker quits smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight (weight)
Body weight and obesity are, according to the SCC, another risk factor for the occurrence of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the report adds.
Nutrients
The organisation also recommends limiting consumption of red meat.
Excessive consumption can lead to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
It is advisable to avoid sausages for which the same applies.
Canning meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can cause damage to the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," the report adds.
Vitamins
Recently, various scientists have focused on the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, the research has not yet yielded clear conclusions.
Vitamin E studies are contradictory according to the SCC.
Although according to one of them, there will be a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another study talks about its increase.
Even the effect of vitamin D on cancer has not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also insists on the importance of discussing his concerns and family precedents with his doctor.
"Making a test doesn't mean you're going to have cancer."
Higgs Boson Examined
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused a legitimate stir last summer.
There is an opinion that this boson is involved in the mechanism that is responsible for all the matter in the universe.
And it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or "least bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - which has not yet been empirically observed.
However, there is still no 100% certainty among physicists that it is a Higgs boson.
There is no doubt that we have an entirely new particle, which is very similar to the Higgs boson, as predicted by the standard model.
The new data published this week during the Great Physical Congress in Kyoto rather confirms it, but all the data is still missing in order to be absolutely sure.
However, let's assume it's a Higgs boson, because the risk of error seems small, and let's look at what it's actually about.
In this world, there is a completely indisputable law, according to which two things cannot occur at the same time in the same place.
This rule cannot be circumvented - and do not try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
Although particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that a similar law applies to it: the Pauli exclusion principle, according to which two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" roughly speaking creates some of their properties.
It further divides the physical particles into two categories.
On the one hand, we find orderly citizens, or fermions, who obediently adhere to the Pauli principle.
And at the other end, there are barefoot, mean anarchists who don't appreciate anything at all - certainly not this principle, which means they can safely be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons are further divided into two groups according to the device (by the way absolutely amazing), which is The Particle Adventure, in the Berkeley laboratories: the mesons that we leave here unnoticed, and the "force particles" that propagate the great forces of nature and with which the Higgs boson is probably somehow related.
However, it must be said that these barefoot animals are not as exotic as one might think.
If you read this article, it is thanks to a boson with an unusual banality: a photon, or "particle of light", which is the "carrier" of electromagnetic force.
Because when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "disrupts" the electromagnetic field at this particular location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disruption" an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.) arises, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons, "force carriers".
A more stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that a different field, the Higgs field, needs to be "disrupted" in order for this boson to appear.
This Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, very high energy values must be achieved, similar to the frozen level of the pond, only a very large boulder will cross.
For this reason, it is necessary to use such a huge part accelerator as the accelerator in the CERN laboratory - a large hadron accelerator with accelerator beams is a circle with a circumference of 27 km! - in order to develop such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is useful again to clarify the relationship between Higgs and matter.
Not all particles or materials react with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, do so, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never keep away from itself on the refrigerator.
And still, not all particles react with the Higgs field: those that do have a certain mass, while others (such as a photon, let's look at it) don't.
And Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> asks, what is all this research for, what will it "bring to us"?
From a scientific point of view, this is a validation of the Standard Model (SM), which allows physicists to examine any discrepancy between SM observations and predictions.
In addition, not many physicists literally wish that they could be found, because the slightest difference could open up the space of "new physics" and close some gaps in the model.
It should be noted that the model still has huge shortcomings, it does not bring any clarification of gravity (ooh!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the space mass (again ooh!).
However, the CERN device has not yet revealed such contradictions.
Reactions
The responses of these researches in the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k can only be very difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, the laser pioneers in Bell’s labs had no idea of the revolution their work would bring.
They assumed scientific use, but nothing else.
Physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who created the first permanent laser beam (previous beams were pulsed) in 1962, I have already said - the laser was initially considered such a "toy to the lab".
Just imagine...
And in addition, the application may also result from all the tools that surround the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle created a small light sensor in 1969 during his work on optics.
This sensor, although Boyle initially did not plan it, now serves as the "eye" of all digital cameras in the world and earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities around the LHC necessarily have to change our lives, but it does mean that one really never knows...
Palliative care - The best way to get out of life... <0x7C> Le Devoir
Through his Commission on Decent Dying, Quebek has recently become involved in sensitive end-of-life issues.
The debate should continue shortly, while a bill is being prepared.
There is still a lot of work to be done in this crucial area.
The magazine Le Devoir tried to look at this question in more detail.
Less than a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that fed him gave him a two-year delay.
"They gave me five years to live, and it's already seven," he says without emotion on his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
"But it's still a shock, you can't prepare for this," he adds.
The disease has done its job: an immense weakness makes it impossible for him to take himself to the toilet or just eat himself.
He looks down at the delicious-looking breakfast and agrees to help him eat.
He is brave and even smiles, talking to strangers who stop by, bringing him medicine, offering a bath.
Courage for an ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to get rid of the diarrhea, which humiliates me," he says.
A few hours later, a team of doctors found a cure for his problem.
“You learn all your life that men stand up and pee,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois facility.
Returning to the stage of a child is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the abilities of which person" whether he accepts the return, according to the psychologist.
In the opinion of many people who are engaged in palliative care, the crucial moments take place at the very core of such a return.
Patients who enter the home with palliative care Victor-Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
Their prognosis is a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses who care for them does not provide them with so-called "curative" care.
In the case of Mrs. A, 89 years old, the worst fear is to die of asphyxiation in full consciousness.
But the disease allowed me to discover my children.
"I have good children," he adds.
"I don't have any wishes in my life anymore," she says, and then she agrees to have her breathing apparatus installed.
However, he is still looking forward to his son’s last visit from Italy in the coming days.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, in collaboration with a group of volunteers, body care is provided with the help of nutrition.
This is what palliative care looks like when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
Québec has one palliative care bed per 11,700 inhabitants.
That's very little if we realize that we're all going to die one day.
Here life continues in optimal conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors in the home.
Whether it is a level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When a person dies, for example, you can give him a sip of brandy or pepsi, according to taste.
Diabetics no longer need to monitor their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night they brought a beer to Mr. X, who died later that night.
This morning, his son finishes his beer in honor of his late father.
“We are helping patients as well as their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the Victor-Gadbois home, days go by one after another, but they do not resemble each other.
In addition to the 93-year-old man who rejoices at his last encounter with his family thoroughly grounded on pillows while they toast to him in his honor, a tragically 36-year-old man surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children dies after having tried every opportunity to survive.
“For six months now, there are always three to five beds that are designed for people with cancer under 45,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who come to Victor-Gadbois’ home come from their homes, 47% from hospitals.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care that is designed to alleviate suffering once the patient reaches the final stage of their life, whether it is at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois home and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care provided to cancer patients.
And it is this fundamental lack of access to health care in Quebec that has led many palliative care physicians to fear the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been in circulation, signed by leading experts in the field of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, in which they demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Québec health care system is not powerful enough to ensure everyone has access to quality palliative care before euthanasia can be accepted.
She says she recently experienced a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in tremendous pain without anyone taking the necessary steps to relieve her.
He fears that patients will not be asked to be killed because they are not receiving proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists take care of their patients until the last moments, regardless of the unfavorable prognosis.
Hel<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard's chances of survival were already very low when she left demanding chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was quitting treatment, she said she regretted stopping the fight, she told us.
And she told me it was over!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who wish to die thank their doctors for failing to fulfill their wishes when a team of palliative bitches relieved their pain.
However, it must be said that palliative care is not all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Grand Montréal Society for Home Palliative Care, patients are prevented from treating pain in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often use palliative sedatives, which put the patient to sleep until the moment of death, whether by accident or whether the sedatives are constantly administered to him.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not perceive this part of suffering.
The patient, who will not be relieved of pain, will have more and more access to palliative sedatives.
Sick people who are not given a sedative always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to give me euthanasia,” it means “I want you to get rid of my pain.”
The report was made possible by a grant for journalists from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Extensive real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, entrepreneurs in construction and public works, political party lobbyists and experts in the Italian mafia are still telling what they know about the amazing “system” in which construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unions and mafia are mixed.
This "field" came to the Québec taxpayers very expensive especially between 1990 and 2000.
“It’s interesting how the system has deteriorated since we took major measures,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Québec MP and former chief of police in Montreal.
It sparked a scandal in 2011 following a thorough investigation into the embezzlement of funds in connection with Quebec’s road construction contracts, which then-Liberal Québec Prime Minister Jean Charest approved after long delays.
The "Duchesneau Report" confirmed a direct link between industry, opaque party financing and corruption of civil servants.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010,” he says, “only the Department of Transportation has saved $1 billion in contracts,” when some people have kept their instincts in check to get a share of them!
Charbonneau’s commission “has already led two mayors to resign,” she adds, hoping to “unmask the cunning of some people.”
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Standing Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in the fight against its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
In addition, the officers of the "Marteau Company", who since 2009 ensured that the Montreal "cartel of money pipelines" significantly eased the inflating of contracts...
In recent weeks, they have carried out a number of searches and accused a number of municipal officials of fraud and corruption, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of one of the suburbs.
Next on the list is Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly accepting bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Transport engineers from Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have also received formal charges.
Lino Zambito sparked a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanism of the “system” of procurement.
During these years, he himself donated 3% of the value of the contracts he received in Montreal to a mafia-affiliated middleman, who then transferred the money to the Union Montréal party, for which Mayor Gérald Tremblay was a candidate.
Zambito was generous to all parties after 2000 and donated more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, but especially to the liberals who were in power at the time.
He also confessed to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts with money pipelines, the prices of which exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked very well.
Gilles Surprenant, a former transport engineer, described him in great detail before the commission: within ten years, he had received gifts from construction companies, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pocket money worth a total of $736,000 in exchange for contracts with money pipelines, for which he overstated the price.
Other public officials from the transport sector admitted that they had paid rewards for overestimating invoices by 30% to 40% through false multi-works.
Martin Dumont, the mayor’s party’s organiser, then accused Tremblay of embarrassingly turning a blind eye to a parallel budget that brought dirty money into his treasury.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, throwing Montréal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was among the first Montréal MPs to issue a warning signal.
As mayor of Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he has been campaigning since 2010 against the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold for... 1.6 million to promoters right in the midst of a thriving real estate store.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
About the investigation, which will finally be launched, he says that “he is pulling the strings in an effort to understand the functioning of the system contaminated with ants to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits.”
The process is “painful but positive.”
We are in the stage of cleansing the wound, but it is necessary to establish our own investigation unit in Montreal and to ensure that these dubious practices cannot be reversed.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau himself says that “public officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is particularly concerned about the role of “envoys informed of this deception” if they have not soaked themselves in these scams!
He estimates that 70% of the funding for Quebec’s election campaigns comes from dirty money, and ironically adds: “I’ve heard it’s just a faint decoction of reality.”
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to $100, but this will not resolve the situation: “Unless election spending is strictly limited, dirty money will not disappear from politics.”
He proposes a comprehensive review of the system of public procurement and party financing: "We can no longer go down; if we boldly focus on the essence of things, we can build again on a firmer foundation and with greater control and compliance with the laws."
If this story has tarnished the image of Quebec and Montreal abroad, Duchesneau recommends that anyone who mocks him look in their own backyard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you and PSG have set a whole new pace.
How do you explain this development?
It can be explained by the fact that all individuals went into each other, or by a completely new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come to us.
Every day I get along with them.
The technical team helped me a lot too.
Every day these facts allow me to increase the level of the game.
And it's easier in matches.
In football, everything goes so fast.
But I'm not losing my head.
From my beginnings in preparation at INF Clairefontaine to my transfer to Saint-Etienne, I have always shifted by degrees.
So you're taking advantage of the competitive environment that Carlo Ancelotti introduced...
The strengths of this summer are used to playing matches at a very high level.
They also know that every training is essential.
And it follows that a player like me then has a greater appetite for the match and wants to give the maximum performance.
Besides, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my position.
He has assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
And does Ancelotti have the decisive word at the right time?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in the 1st league and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with top teams.
He also worked with excellent players.
I think he's going to win more titles in Paris.
I had a calming conversation with him in January.
I had a lot of injuries.
The trust he gives me is another reason for my performance.
How do you feel about the first part of the PSG season?
In the 1st league, Lyon took our lead.
But we remain in the shadows.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we made it to the eight-finals very easily.
What is your club’s goal in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as possible.
Anything can happen now.
But we definitely want to be a tough opponent for quality European teams.
We want to win our qualifying group before Port first so that we can play in the rematch of the eight-finals at home.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
The budget already has...
For Paris to become a great European club, it has to win titles and make history.
That's not the case today.
On the financial side, PSG has the means to achieve this goal.
And would it be a big failure not to win the 1st league like last season?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
We really want to win the league title this year.
Last season we missed it a lot.
In May, we were disappointed because we had to win.
We had a great season.
We scored 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, you are a clear master...
But another club, Montpellier, had an even better season.
I think it's going to work this year.
“Although big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are trying to win the title, I think we have weapons at our disposal to defeat them.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is not unusual to expect a lot from us, given what has been invested here and what kind of players we have.
We totally accept that.
The fact is that if we beat Troyes 4-0 at home and still find something to blame in the newspapers, it’s not very pleasant.
One wonders what more people can ask of you.
Of course, you can’t win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to adjust our game style.
You need time to build a team.
In the Champions League, we have proven that we can play.
Look at Manchester City, which hasn’t made it to the finals in its second season, and they’ve also invested a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, you could expect to have a 15-point lead ahead of the other ones!
You're insulting other clubs and the French league.
Clubs Lyon and Marseille, which did not have much success last season, moved to the next phase with the new PSG.
It shows how great the first league is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we managed to win.
It seems like PSG relied on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s performances in everything.
It is good that it is said that there is a "dependence on Zlatan".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very powerful and gives a lot of goals.
That's why he came here and proves he's the star of the Premier League.
Everywhere he went, he proved to be a great player, a world star.
In our team we respect both the person and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly exceptional.
This has led others to increase their own level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows others to grow side by side.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to play in this tournament.
Unfortunately, because of the injury, I couldn’t play as I had imagined.
But I've experienced it, and I've come out stronger.
Today I play good matches in the national team.
This is what I have been hoping for since I joined the team.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we owe it to ourselves to make our performance exemplary.
How do you view Didier Deschamps’ first months at the head of the national team?
The results speak for him.
We are in a good place in qualifying for the MS.
The coach chooses strictly, is close to the players and can enthusiastically win.
That was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to compare them.
Blanc achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings our team to Brazil.
Is the draw (1:1) of October 16 in Spain a solid starting match?
This game has given us confidence.
We all fought for the team.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, you can pay and sell without banks
All negatives of current financial transactions based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between beneficiaries.
Moreover, as is often true in the context of these technologies, there is a clear political outlook: the belief that the current financial system, built on banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
Bitcoin, the inventor of which is Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), represents both virtual money (but transferable to dollars, euros...) and a secure transfer protocol similar to BitTorrent, which allows file exchange between two partners.
With 15,000 computers connected to the network, approximately 200,000 transactions have already been registered.
About a thousand websites already accept bitcoins as gifts or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate first reached a maximum of $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, five months later it fell to $2, today it is at the limit of about ten dollars (an overview of the exchange rates is provided on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Compared to the global exchange for real money or financial products, this is nothing impressive.
And yet, the European Central Bank (ECB) is interested in this fact in its report on virtual finance, which was published in October.
Bitcoin is described as “the most successful virtual money,” “competing the dollar and the euro,” and “a pattern of regular money.”
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual money in that it is used as "credits" for the progression in a video game, which one acquires through the game or which one can purchase (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
Each month, however, the central authority checks and processes individual communications.
In the case of Bitcoin, all nodes are book depositors, controllers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users takes place in fact between two electronic addresses by e-mail.
However, the user can choose a different address for each payment, thereby ensuring anonymity.
The file of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can then verify the legitimacy of the transaction.
It is also possible to ensure that exchanged bitcoins exist in the public ledger of current accounts, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key phase lies in writing this new transaction into this book.
It is done by solving a mathematical task assigned to computers, the solver of which, a temporary central banker, will have the right to complete this additional line.
This is the phase of cutting a file; that is, transforming a huge file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" this new transaction and add a number to it, only then the whole "cut".
The goal is to find a number that provides a specific imprint (very zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes will easily check its correctness.
The transaction will then appear indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the imprint.
If the user would like to pay twice the same money very quickly in a row (within ten minutes), the network will only confirm one of the two transactions - the other will be abandoned, because each of them has a different imprint.
The computer that solves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is regularly divided by two, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to one hundred millionth, so there is room for margin.
The difficulty of the given task also increases with the increasing level of calculation.
The network has already experienced its ups and downs.
Websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins stored have been stolen.
“The rubble used does not concern the protocol itself,” said Pierre Noizat, who founded Paymium, a real-money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also checks the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But this problem also applies to cash.
Prominent players like Wikipedia reject gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel recently analyzed a book of current accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "huge discounts" were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul to convert bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a pedagogical book on this money, has great confidence in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (with real money) or contactless mobile payment, but it uses the Bitcoin system to verify transactions that are therefore cheaper.
In addition, the holder manages his/her identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up with traders, where there is no need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough to give an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by the phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems and the transition to more horizontal systems.
“It’s going to be a while before Bitcoin gets through, but 2013 could be a decisive year,” he predicts.
In addition, the ECB’s report foresees a reassessment of the various risks that are now considered to be increased if this type of money is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and U.S. troops are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take control of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their own future and not wait for everything from us.
The worst damage was done to the people in the Afghan countryside, who we punished because we considered them terrorists.
And so did we, after all, we lost 88 soldiers killed, and all those injuries and mutilations.
The Taliban are composed of foreign extremists, former leaders who fled to Pakistan, but are often villagers who reject the presence of foreign armies as in Soviet times.
They just want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are now experiencing tolerance and frequent help from local insurgents, but if Western forces withdraw, their support will decline.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I watched from the tops of the mountains planted with almonds thanks to French loans, was orderly.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles arrived in Kabul without attack, accompanied by helicopters.
By the end of 2014, the Taliban will no longer be active in Kabul.
Since their unstoppable progress in 1994-1996, conditions have changed significantly.
Kabul was empty at the time, and the earth was in blood and fire as a result of fighting between various resistance groups.
Their taking control of the country was then considered a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the gloom of these villagers, who were completely controlled by Al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved in our time.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban agree in an effort to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main dignitaries of the war against the Soviet troops returned to power in 2001.
They became businessmen, seized state land they sold as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and used huge US contracts for subcontractors.
They discredited themselves; most of them were never even in combat.
According to what I've heard in the campaigns, people want a government that's not going to be made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the way those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity will: the capital leakage is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its associated ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they got to know the modern world and its advantages captivated them.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; 5 million people currently live in Kabul, a fifth of the total population.
Public schools are full in the cities, girls and boys go there.
These young people will have to be provided with work, they no longer want to return to the darkness of the former parties or to the corruption of some of the leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, loves mobile phones; television and Turkish TV shows that show the modern world are watched everywhere.
The army is already present.
Will the authorities that take the lead be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the struggle against the Soviet army are already restoring provincial militias that will be out of the control of the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country heavily influenced by local identity, should enjoy some degree of decentralization along the lines of Western states, but the U.S. wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential influence, so the post of prime minister, which had existed since the adoption of the constitution in 1964, was abolished.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been heavily dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and earlier.
No industry has been able to recover, no dam is functioning, no major irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, only fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country destroyed by three decades of war, government control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
And that only fueled the feeling that the Western states were here just to seize it.
Without energy to process iron ore or copper on site and without the means to transport raw materials through the mountains, no mining of minerals can take place.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mine and left the opportunity for international archaeological teams (with the support of the World Bank) to explore the vast Buddhist site in order to retain the role of the most important employer in the entire province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which a large part of both imports and exports depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement envisages the continuation of the usual types of assistance: girls' and boys' lyceums, the Department of French at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, the initiative "to gain heart and soul" has been working, trying to reconcile the difficult task of aid and military activities, within the framework of which the service of "civil-army steps" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was abolished in 2012, but thanks to the few French NGOs has achieved a number of successes in the field of common interest and steps for the country.
These works, involving many local workers, helped to silence the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, afforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and the expansion of arable land.
What kind of memory will we leave behind after two billion euros in military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving local living conditions, which are very challenging in these valleys, which are often found at altitudes above 2,000 m.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural assistance from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free themselves from the insurrections led by foreign groups, these farmers wish, according to their words, to obtain a small amount of civil aid in their favour, which would be properly controlled and directly affecting them.
Difficult work on the Egyptian Constitution
President Mohamed Morsi is playing another game of poker.
While Egypt remains the most divided in its history due to the proclamation of a constitution that temporarily grants it unlimited powers, he decided to play vabank.
On Wednesday, he announced, regardless of everyone else’s opinion, that the Constitutional Assembly would approve the final text the next day.
Less than a week ago, the Head of State granted the Assembly two more months to complete the necessary work.
For almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, which has been supplemented many times, weakening the country's constitutional stability and leading to legal conjectures.
This new initiative has only further strengthened the country’s split.
From the opposition's point of view, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium", continues to "break his word" and " tramples the law".
But his supporters say it is a means to reverse the constitutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held in two weeks.
This is a very short period of time, which will force the Brotherhood to withdraw from the intention of the text to the Egyptians to clarify the article after the article.
It is also a way for the president to regain national and democratic legitimacy, while the whole country is being swept away by protests.
As confirmed in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favour.
Particularly because this hastily organised vote puts the Egyptian people before an ultimatum: "Either you approve my text, or I will retain unlimited powers", which should otherwise end after the approval of the new constitution.
And in this special atmosphere yesterday, 85 MPs of the aforementioned Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, approved the text.
The majority of the Liberals were absent from the vote.
In mid-November, shortly before the proclamation of the constitution, they knocked on the door, saying they had no opportunity to assert their views.
Human rights defenders, civil society or members of religious minorities imitated their move.
In order to achieve a quorum, 11 alternates were promptly added yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles of the Constitution were often voted unanimously.
The commentators also paused on the fact that one of the few quarrels that day revolved around... prayer hours, when some members of the committee held the view that the hours in the meeting room were not properly set up.
The text, which was voted on last night, consists of 234 articles.
The subject matter of general attention, Article 2, remains ultimately consistent with the 1971 version of the Constitution and stipulates that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the introduction of Islamic law is one of the essential requirements, hoped to replace the term "principles" with the term "rules", which would allow for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been corrected is a sign of their goodwill and respect for other parts of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the Liberals object, who see it as a rhetorical problem.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They focus in particular on Article 220, which confers an advisory role on al-Azhar University, in particular on issues of checking the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pommier, this is troubling because "the people called to express themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
This is the beginning of the theocracy.”
Liberals are even more concerned by the fact that the next rector of the university should be less moderate than the current one.
"So far, there has been no concrete religious consequence.
With this constitution, Egypt remains a civil state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulamas, but university workers, many of whom graduated from French schools," Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a paper on the constitutional transition in Egypt, said.
However, it agrees that "there may be contradictions with regard to the interpretation of Article 220 because the terms used in it belong to the religious dictionary.
In particular, there is a reference to "fiqh" [Islamic legal science, ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to speak out.”
The text approved yesterday is highly criticized, in addition to religious pages, because of the expanded powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood insists that there have been significant restrictions on them over the former regime.
Another controversial place: the powers vested in the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the army representatives, the verification of the defense budget will not be carried out by the parliament, but by the National Defense Council.
In addition, military courts will not prohibit the conduct of civilians, as required by the association for the protection of human rights.
These associations speak about their doubts in connection with the text, which they believe is directed against freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and the insult continues to be prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article deals with the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture referred to in Article 36.
This word was not mentioned in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to deliver a televised speech last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will then demonstrate on Saturday.
In Israel waiting for Ukrainian tourists holy places, the belly button of the world and the sea of saturated salt solution
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort, and the inviolability of nature.
AaF has identified the five most important reasons why you should visit Israel.
Worshiping the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who enter into this “bath” will receive God’s mercy.
And Galileo - the place of Jesus' miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here, too, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the most holy places are in Jerusalem.
The faithful will pass through the Path of Pain, or Jesus’ Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antonia - Pretoria - where the trial was held, it passes through the streets of the Old Town and leads to the Temple of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the crucifixion, to the stone of the anointing and to the place where Jesus was buried.
Here is the symbolic Christian navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was built on the place where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which they made a cross for the crucifixion of Jesus.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred site for Jews, the Wall of Wailing, the rest of the temple that was destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which will then be fulfilled.
Take the path vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Masada remained a secret hiding place from the enemy, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
The ruins are located on cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
Only those who are engaged in mountaineering can reach it with their own strength.
The rest will be taken to this historic mountain by a cable car.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous ski resort Hermon, which experiences a huge influx of tourists in the winter months.
A shuttle bus transports tourists to this ski paradise from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the mountain slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can’t visit all of them in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are definitely worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, which is located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
His paintings are widely represented by impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akkon, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which presents visitors with several rooms of the ancient Turkish bath with figurines of bath users and spa nurses from that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the statues of Dal<0xC3><0xAD> and Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly refused.
The Fifth Museum, the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic part of the museum - the Children's Memorial - was built in memory of 1.5 million children who were murdered in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You will enter – and you will find yourself in total darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they perished.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Improve your health
Israel’s three main spa resorts are located on the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Sea coasts.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that in the Red Sea you can swim even in the winter months, because the water temperature in it does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer, and people bathe in it all year round.
The Dead Sea, by the way, is the strangest sea in the world, located at the lowest land point of the planet - at a level of 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a saturated salt solution that easily keeps on the surface even people who can not swim.
The surrounding landscape is unrealistically beautiful.
Come here to undergo treatment using salt water - brine, and healing mud, which can treat health problems with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes, to cure cramped nerves.
Touch the Mysterious Past
It is protected by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through them passed the famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Mentions of this city are found in the oldest Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is the place where Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life together.
Tourists really love to wander through narrow streets, named after the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you press against the walls in the alley of "your" sign, happiness will favor you.
In Jaffa, you may meet newlyweds who come here from all over Israel and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea - in the city of King Herod - you can walk through the Roman theater and "conquer" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the seat of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully reconstructed theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourists, in a word.
If you are going to Israel, you do not have to worry about your imperfect English: in this country about 30% of the population speak Russian.
It is better to take money with you not in euros, but in dollars, which you can easily exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar is about 3.8 shekels).
There are mainly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram and Haifa is the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper one.
It is basically an underground cable car.
Travelling by all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive for 1.5 hours with a changeover.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, work stops at markets, shops and public transport.
And on Sunday morning, the work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels you will get only kosher food: except for pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes containing combinations of milk and meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts, prepared from coconut milk, traditional Jewish porridge hummus, various kinds of sauces, minced chickpeas balls - falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
However, there are a lot of fattened cats who gracefully "walk to their liking".
In the evening you can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats love crowded places and enjoy every kind of goodies.
Renting a car will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
And borrowing a bike will cost about 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Expressed by numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
To explore the country and relax came the most citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
The promised country was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than in the same period in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Great and powerful" will announce it to Moscow: emigrants will save money on language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are still debating a law on compulsory language exams, fraudsters have already emerged in the country selling “fake” certificates.
Every year, 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn enough money to support families at home.
On December 1, the law came into force, according to which every working migrant will be obliged to pass the exam of knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing and utilities, lifestyle and retail sectors.
However, FMS promises that over time, the relevant tests will be mandatory for all visitors.
However, the exams will consist not only of language skills, but also of Russian history and the foundations of law.
Proficiency in the language will also be required to obtain and renew a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law does not apply even to people who successfully managed to achieve attestation and obtain an academic diploma until the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Benefit, condemnation and protection of rights
The network of test sites will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship between Nations, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take exams in all cities; more than 160 such centers are already open in Russia.
The initiative to support the introduction of testing was also supported by deputies of the State Duma and FMS (Federal Migration Services).
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders were able to ask the press many times: and what will it actually bring?
What will change the obligation to know the language for the Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, this will allow the number of people suffering as a result of "slave labor" to be reduced.
Many people today talk about the protection of the rights of migrant workers, explains Chairman of the Board of FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights should begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise with emigrants without a profession, without education, who do not know the language and do not have a medical examination.
Without knowledge of the language, Sebelev says, the future migrant is doomed to clashes with dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide a "ticket" to terrible, tight hostels, in which he and dozens of others, like himself, will suffer for months without food and documents and work for 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrant workers.
“They promise them one thing in their homeland, but when they arrive, they cheat them, they confiscate their passports, they don’t pay the promised wages,” said Tolib Sharipov, head of the General Directorate of Labour Migration in Tajikistan.
Don't broadcast!
Especially since many citizens of Central Asian republics who intend to go to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they want to enter, but do not even have experience with the work.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as rather their misfortune: very few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get at least a reasonable basic education.
After all, their families also need something to feed their children, not to mention the fact that they need to be properly dressed, dressed and equipped for school.
As children reach a productive age, they must go to work at the first opportunity.
Without knowledge of the language, it is difficult - they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
It is true that, with regard to the Language Examination Act, human rights defenders point to one important thing.
The tests will only be carried out on migrants who have legal status.
If they don't have it, they won't take the exams or get any other official job.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Unauthorized Entry Banned"
Many of the incoming workers claim that getting an official status in our country is not easy.
The reason - bureaucratic obstacles and all those language difficulties.
Legalization, in addition, costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be obtained quickly and only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we basically have fake documents, without registration, and this leads to cases of blackmail.
"They demand a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea," Tajikistani citizen Umed Chushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be greedy, buy yourself a painting"
On the first day of the language law, it was found that not only the registration documents of migrants are fake.
FMS employees have already confiscated several false certificates for passing the language exam.
Forged documents are printed on an ordinary color printer.
Of course, they did not get to the new owners for free: each of the migrants, hoping to ease the problem of passing the tests, paid for this document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times the amount of the official test: it will cost migrant workers three thousand rubles.
The main task of the near future is to secure the system against corruption, so that workers can not simply buy documents, government officials and human rights defenders agree.
For the time being, government authorities can promise foreign workers who failed the tests for the first time the time needed to complete the Russian language basics course.
Visitors who do not speak Russian are expected to work in areas where active interaction with people is not required.
MVD (Ministry of the Interior) does not enter into circulation the illegal arms market
The share of crimes using legally held weapons is very low
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
It is the reaction of government authorities to recent events: the stimulus was the cases of shootings at weddings that went without victims, and the massacre prepared by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, which resulted in the deaths of seven people.
Police want to ban the carrying of dangerous weapons in public places and increase the age from which you can get a license to carry weapons - from 18 to 21 years.
This idea is supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Jarovaya, who promised that changes to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian state authorities are trying to cope with the problem by "tightening the screws".
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various social shooting organizations - demanded the rejection of the "nonsensical tightening" of the law.
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and criminalist, in an interview with the Russian BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, 142 offences involving firearms registered by the Ministry of the Interior were committed in the six months of 2012, while a total of 1168 thousand offences were committed in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that the tightening of the legislation in the field of civil weapons will not force the perpetrator to switch to the "black" market.
According to them, at present, any weapon can be found in Moscow at a low price.
Currently, the Ministry of the Interior says that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from races to officers
The "black" arms market is supplied by several channels.
The main channels are five, says retired colonel Victor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c, who worked for ten years in the workplaces of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of sites that accept gun orders
The first of them - "army or military road", that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranets said.
Another type of “black weapons” are weapons stolen by criminals from security forces.
The sheepman explains that this includes thefts from police warehouses and weapons stolen directly from employees of law enforcement agencies.
Illegal "mainly" go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions often occur in many military warehouses.
"It has been proven that some fires were intentionally started - to cover up the flaw," the former soldier said.
According to Barance, weapons manufacturers also contribute their contribution.
“Currently, private arms companies are emerging that are not competitive on the international market, and they are dismantling the weapons they supply to the black market, including Moscow,” he said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A particularly large number of pistols and automata come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is their production, sometimes weapons are produced in small-scale production, and the mafia was formed, which organized their smooth production," the former soldier explains.
Where's the gun from?
Experts have summed up the approximate share of individual sources of illegal arms supplies to the "black" market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
The specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and the Russian Statistical Office, criminological literature and data from public data portals focused on the topic of weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to researchers, come from military and executive bodies.
Half of all weapons found themselves on the black market "because of officials whose work is linked to weapons," the report said.
According to the data available to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from armed conflicts, in 14% of cases there was a theft of weapons in their production, 5% is "black archaeology".
A dealer-consultant at one of the arms stores, who asked us not to mention his name, is convinced that the weapons found in the excavations by black "archaeologists" are no longer bought - they are simply too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go for new shipments directly to military warehouses.
Through the ensign, the interested person buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
You order a gun from him and he sells it over the fence.
"He takes it to the city and sells it there for 900 euros for a piece with two magazines," he says.
“The truth is that the police are well-informed, and therefore whenever they start to burn their plan in the clarification of crimes, they will make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers,” he added.
"Like in a luxury store"
Sellers most often find each other with the buyer through their acquaintances.
I went to websites and blogs until a guy showed up who offered me the opportunity to switch to the Trial platform, where there would be a man who would lead me to the "corner" where we would interact.
I found out the price there.
Military Reporter Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
If I want to get a gun, I need a friend who knows the way out, says the salesman-adviser.
There are sellers on the market, but there is also a need to go, hypothetically "from Mr. Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell him that his daughter had lost a tooth."
And now I'm going to get there through a man I'm sure of.
He will deliver them only to me, because he knows that I will not give him up.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was working on a publication on the subject.
The scheme has not changed in his words.
They gave him a photo album with "everything you thought" on it.
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Baran<0xC4><0x9B>ce, does not offer rabbits in a bag - you can try everything.
I, a potential client, just do not buy - we go with the seller to the forest and build a target for it.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I see that the gun is shooting well, we start to act," the expert describes the procedure.
Tray on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet will bring you to websites and groups on "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for various purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required.
"It is enough to have a fixed amount of money," they write in an advertising headline on the website "Buy a fighting gun or a machine gun."
On this site, users leave their notifications and ask questions.
Selling to minors?
"Of course without a license," the user asks "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"Buy TT.Moscow" - briefly formulates the request "Fedorenkov."
The federal security service has recently set off a huge network of plugged-in websites and people who want to buy a military weapon can grab a shovel.
People flock like hungry fish to bait and then mine coal in Siberia.
Military reporter and senior military officer Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c
I have heard about such schemes: websites are usually registered outside the scope of Russian law.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, the seller will send him a photo and a description with instructions on where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the NGO Right to a Gun.
Viktor Baran<0xC4><0x9B>c confirms that after placing an order on the website, you can remain unarmed and find yourself behind bars.

Makarov for $100
When you buy an illegal firearm, experts estimate that you will pay between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "Right to a gun" you will get a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait a month to a month and a half.
The weapon is dispatched from the warehouses for long-term storage through the warehouses of the middle cell.
According to the official statistical office, compared to the period January - October 2011 the number of these crimes in Russia totaled by 7%, and amounted to 22.9 thousand cases, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, workers of fast food and supermarkets
A quarter of all U.S. teens will work at McDonald’s.
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in America against low wages in Walmart hypermarkets and in restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
So far, no one can predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave, or whether it is destined to soon disappear.
The whole action is supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing social organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that regular workers in Walmart and in fast food systems receive, the goal of the protest organizers is to create them in their trade union organizations.
Currently, this economic sector is virtually untouched by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", when an orgy of cheap sales hit America, captivated millions of residents, and in some cases was accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their workplaces and demonstrated together with trade unions and left-wing activists of multinational retail chains whose goods are intended for lower- and middle-class people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-wage employees in Walmart stores shop only at work.
The availability and range of products have made Walmart one of the largest companies in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods so cheaply, partly because it pays its employees little.
They also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of automatic trolleys or hand scanners.
Protesters on Black Friday demanded a pay rise and complained that the company’s health insurance costs rose sharply from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee gets $9.5 an hour, but that doesn’t match the cost, employees say.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, say that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the company $3.2 billion a year.
That’s an average of 1.1% more than the company spends on salaries now.
If Walmart shifts the wage increase fully to consumers, each visit to the store will cost just 46 cents more.
In a year, customers spend about $12.39 more than they do today.
Walmart advocates point out that the protest took place in only nine countries and should not cause virtually any harm to society.
"Black Friday" in the company's stores lasted from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the following day, and during that time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Fogelman said that a total of “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was “another media sensation” organized by unions.
"Unoccupied cash register!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their goal was not Walmart department stores (they in the mentioned progressive city are not very popular, and therefore are almost not there), but "McDonald" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn't even pay you sick pay, and he doesn't pay you properly for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage for work in accordance with federal laws and regulations of the state of New York is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are gradually raising this wage, but only slightly, and on average their regular workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
No one in this expensive city has a lower salary.
I don't understand how you can exist in New York for that kind of money.
Almost a quarter of American teenagers who work behind the desk after school part-time and live with their parents will be employed by McDonald’s.
Few people see this as their main source of livelihood or plan to stay there for a long time.
At present, I constantly meet in an interview with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this money and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday morning at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and cooks at fast food businesses start receiving at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing the creation of trade union organizations and punishing trade union activists with bullying and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes their lives easier.
However, the introduction of a trade union in fast food companies is also difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main reasons is the extremely high fluctuation of employees.
Disagreement
On this day, there were also loud protests in a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the event was a meeting at McDonald’s near Times Square at noon, where several local democratic politicians spoke, in particular Jumaane Williams, a member of the city council, who said, “McDonald says he sells billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even pay you sick and he doesn’t pay you properly for your honest work!”
Demonstrators also received the support of other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayoral candidate Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must come together to support fast food workers so that they can achieve the fair reward for their work and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!”
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest event of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people attended, although not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
Whether this event will become a spark that will ignite the flame of the mass movement is still unclear.
So far, the brain has been deceiving on average.
Among fans of modern virtual reality technology is a popular theme of augmented reality; recently it means to perceive the world especially through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google unveiled a working model of the novelty, and in November it was announced that Microsoft had also filed a patent application.
An interview with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies in the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft Sharam Izadim shows that for scientists of this company glasses are already a thing of the past.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual public spaces.
- Please tell us in a framework, what does your research team do?
- We deal with human interaction with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
So far, humanity is stuck in the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, at most sometimes touching the screen with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate significant changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect pickups - this is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is on sale without Kinect pickups, because for everyone there is a very interesting possibility of gesture control.
- What else awaits us in the future?
Despite the fact that the Kinect system has transferred the interaction to the physical level, very many interactions still take place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input flow of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output flow is not yet separate.
We are trying to change this, we are working on really three-dimensional imaging systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
It is necessary to let the computer world into our physical world, to make it more real.
To do this, however, it is necessary to know not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to add virtual objects to the real world in a much more appropriate form.
And first of all - to hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overstated?
- Surely it can not be considered an omnivore - the question of privacy arises, because we do not always want to inform others in our surroundings about their activities and intentions.
In fact, all types of interactions with computers are good, but in their own environment.
For example, for the operation of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about swollen ones, just about such sluggish, short ones.
The gesture would not be filmed with a camera, but with a bracelet that would monitor the movements of bones and muscles.
So far, it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
In general, however, the future has a mixed type of control, such as gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- How do you ask me to give you this can of lemonade, for example?
You say it and you show it at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very difficult to tell.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at a given moment?
- It's not necessary at all, but it's mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that can more accurately detect human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors that provide a fairly good depth resolution, this is very important.
- If you need to talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your requirements for modern cameras?
Isn't there enough resolution, depth, or something else today?
- Basically, the current generation - this is what we can reflect on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 f/s.
But it’s not just about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
At the same time, all current technologies are insufficient for us - this assigns work to designers of algorithms.
So we have to keep in mind not only the resolution in the X and Y axes, but also Z.
So speed is also very important, the number of frames per second.
Human movement is quite dynamic, and current data flows of 30 frames per second are, frankly, a little bit, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our lab in Redmond made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms, with current, mass-produced sensors closer to the second value (60-100 ms).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human interaction with the machine.
For me, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful at work, I just do not need so many touches, but I need some extra images per second.
And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- Three "cameras" are now used in the Kinect system, one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other - a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera - this is actually a regular sensor of the visible band.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
More cameras could potentially solve the problem...
Or worsen it, because it would increase the required volume of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analog Kinect system, play with the curvature of the location of the cameras and see how it will help in determining the three-dimensional position.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft (unlike Google) did not publicly present its glasses.
Don’t you think that when it comes to the daily use of augmented reality technology using special glasses, this is one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around and constantly holding the smatphone in the raised hands is not very comfortable, but I think the strongest option would be a "portable" form of reality expansion, where it would be possible to switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and then around the clock based on the cloud platform.
Glasses - this is a very personal device, there is their strength (private things you see only you), and at the same time also a weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects at the same time with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark in "Iron Man", but also to the ordinary mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point out: there is no touch response!
Hands can't feel anything!
What are your group’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh consecutive breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the addition of tactile sensations could easily become the eighth breakthrough.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is used - the use of the second hand as a certain kind of background for imaging.
Excellent way to record compression!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at adding tactility to these "pictures in the air" - for example, the interference of several directional ultrasound beams at a defined point where the finger is located, it causes a tactile sensation, but it is still very weak - as if you were blowing on the abdomen of your fingers.
There is also a wrist bracelet that affects the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
To think that he feels what it seems he should feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That's a good idea. We haven't tried that yet.
Here is another challenge that will be fought for for a long time - how to get a person who is physically in a very cramped space to believe that he is walking in an open, practically infinite space - we are also working on the concept of cross-country tracks (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms and also huge balls.
If brain deception becomes a goal, then work is for many years to come.
That’s what makes virtual reality work so appealing to researchers — a lot of things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" is a continuation of the project "St. Petersburg Avant-Garde", dedicated to the citizens who are at the forefront, are the avant-garde of culture and art.
At the top of the list were already important figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often find recognition in Europe, without achieving all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the stunning artist Cyril Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man who is all dressed in red, whom you meet here at the Russian Museum, here at the Summer Garden, here in fashion pubs and at vernissages.
Cyril Miller's paintings, wherever they are exhibited, always attract crowds of viewers.
Cyril Miller is one of the purely social and philosophical narrators of St. Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Cyril Miller - this is a prominent man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s and early 90s.
In addition to being a city person, his appearance on the streets brings a smile on the face of citizens, increases everyone's mood.
Recently, he took a bottleneck in his hand and became a St. Petersburg bottleneckist, because he matured into this complex role with his entire bohemian life, philosophy and image.
Cyril, why do you walk around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise?
- I chose the red color as a designer dealing with appearance and image.
In this world, red represents a compromise between the artist, the image maker and the public.
Although it is generally true that anything that is only slightly different from gray, arouses aggression and awakens bad qualities.
But my provocations are aimed at getting a conversation started.
The whole history of my provocative actions is above all an invitation to debate.
And when did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the House of Culture in Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understand what my path is.
Then a wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and I could not understand new, free types of artists.
I befriended the new wave artists, the post-Gazonians, who brought us to Pushkin 10, and there were no other waves.
It attracts me to theatre, dress, music, to all genres except the word.
- And all this was merged in your art-clinic ...- It was important for me to be at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best forces of creativity should be gathered.
In 1995 I took the place at Pushkinska 10, and there before the reconstruction there was a music and art club, a Bohemian club, the home of the St. Petersburg bohemians.
Many were born there:NOM, Tequila Jazz, do not forget how Cord was brought with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
The cord and his friends sang under the plywood of light songs, dressed in tight jerseys, in the middle of them the composer Igor Vdovin, who is now in fashion.
When the band started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg led many programs of Hali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, that started his great career, basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Gribojedov - it's a reverberation of the Art Clinic.
This is where our working and regular guests went.
I am the hero of the last century, when culture meant something else.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press, a special prize was "People in our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was appointed, that ended my peak.
In the new times, according to the old rules, work is unpleasant, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In the present years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things today, you can be popular, but not too cultural.
- Your works are distinctive in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings - these are hits in which actuality and insight are vividly captured.
I'm going to have a program exhibition called The Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, now being so is painful and terrible.
But in clowns, everything is erased, a tragedy is filmed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, to save the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of things.
Today, people meet by clothes, they focus on the external mechanics, not the internal man.
Or maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the delusion will be removed by dressing.
- We recently saw you as a city bottleneck. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
And who should it be if not me?
- And can commercial art be beautiful?
- At present, commercial, applied art should be thorough, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
Previously, people met in the crowd, the bohemian loved one, simple other people.
Today, everything is broken into micro-companies, today it is very difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a 100-dollar bill to please everyone.
Today you need to think about who you like.
Today, every cultural hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand spectators will come to Stas Mikhailov!
- He's got fans coming at him, where the sexual social sphere is involved.
And 300 people come to the cultural land and 10,000 of them will not come, and the result is less management, less money, everything goes bad.
I have fans, the main thing is that no one deceives them and does not violate what is experienced.
When I was young, I painted pictures of a collector hanging on the wall with Falk and Larionov.
I started with the images that people usually end up with.
Nowadays, people often confuse concepts.
They say: Spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no consumer culture, that is from elsewhere.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for drawing pictures.
I am for that kind of culture.
- Cyril, what's lacking in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is such a concept: an agent through culture.
However, not all of them can deal with culture.
In the days of the proper tsars it was not so in everything, the tsars perhaps did not understand culture much, but they understood that it was necessary to support real experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
In St. Petersburg, we have people who might be experts, but they are stuck somewhere in the corner, because we need great experts who will properly appreciate these experts and lead them on the right path.
Today, the taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but different in that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What do you think St. Petersburg is?
- St. Petersburg - this is not the capital of culture, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is the right land.
And on our eel, art thrives poorly.
We need cultural land, but today we have more writers than readers, that’s wrong.
In Europe, there are very many people who are curious, who like to go to exhibitions, concerts.
In our country, such a layer is only weak.
We need art to become a fashion matter, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is funded by St.Petersburg Grant
Born in space
The earth is in jeopardy.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board set off on a journey, looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the main question arises: how to keep your family in weightlessness or on a given replacement planet?
I don't think the choice is big.
In fact, there are only two planets that can be captured, even if only hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the P.K. Sternberg State Astronomical Institute.
While there are better conditions for life on Mars, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees Celsius.
It is possible to live there only at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
To solve the problems of reproduction in space began scientists with flora.
Already half a century ago, experiments on plants were carried out.
The four generations of peas grown in orbit are no different from their earthly relatives.
After that, the insects were carried into orbit - very small fruit flies Drosophila.
In 1979, a quail egg was sent into space to test how the embryo develops in a state of weightlessness.
At the exit, we get an absolutely normal bird.
But then the problems begin.
“There is a problem with the fact that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” says Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IBMP).
If they do not find support, the birds fall chaotically and make snags.
After 10 hours, the newly hatched birds completely lost their instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, they just died in four days.
"We let birds hatch twice, but then we turned it down because it's simply impossible to work with them there," says Vladimir Sychev, a scientist at the University of Washington.
The last "miniarch" with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
But in the biosatellite "Bion" there will only be beings of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats that were already being sent into space pregnant.
In fact, they found nothing supernatural.
"It was only on biosatellites, but again - this is a unique experiment and such experiments need to be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing on the ground, the space rats were born offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult task.
Animals with the loss of their usual environment simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Man, unlike animals, in principle can.
Homo sapiens dominates abstract thinking and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The greatest danger threatened Tereshkov.
The most precious thing humanity has is a woman’s body.
Our Teacup flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would last into space.
Whether she can give birth to a child after such a flight.
"No one has answered this question yet," said Vachtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the space and rocket industry.
In June 1964, more than a year after the space flight, the first female astronaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child was also cosmonaut Andrijan Nikolayev.
In 1988, the son of the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savicka was born, who visited orbit twice and also worked in open space.
But the risk remains.
We have only a few cosmonauts, who after many years were born and grow healthy offspring.
"In addition, it can be dangerous even during orbital flights," says the cosmonaut-pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
Yet humanity must inevitably seek new paths in the fields of biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The CPK Hydrolab is a mandatory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero-attraction conditions, cosmonauts learn the habits needed to work in open space.
Water mimics a state of weightlessness.
Although for adults, water is a comfortable, but in a way strange environment, for young children it is a natural element.
Little Ichthyandri seem to confirm that life on earth comes from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is on average 9 months in the mother's fetal water and that it is easier for them to get used to the water.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks will pass.
"It's very little for a child to forget something," says newborn swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short - if for a newborn baby the state of weightlessness is a more natural state, then for women the inevitable gravity, the attractive force, is more natural.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, pelvic muscles, lose weight very quickly, the body's ability to displace the fetus decreases.
We can leave this aside if the stimulants of muscle activity during childbirth work.
After all, it is possible for childbirth to take place in a special chamber, in which the organism of the mother expels the fetus.
"What next?" Valery Polyakov asks complex questions.
On the other hand, the baby also needs artificial gravity.
If the organism is not affected by the earth's attraction, it can not properly form the skeleton or the system of muscles.
It is not possible to dress a newborn in orbit as an adult in a special suit with a load in which he can train.
He will simply be deprived of what he absolutely needs for his development.
“If we go with you to an experiment that allows the birth of a child in a foreign environment, we will bring to Earth a disabled person who will be completely unadapted to the local environment,” Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics commission of IBP RAN, predicts.
So the birth of children in space today is just a theoretical question.
One day, however, the time will come when it will become a reality and when the Earthlings will embark in their ships on a distant planet that will become the home of their space-born descendants.
The head of the SAO: the control of the blackout system failed due to the fault of politicians
The Czech Republic has good auditors and quality legislation in connection with public procurement, but it is lagging behind in its application.
The Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, Miloslav Kala, said this in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - that's what I think we lack," Kala said.
Similar conclusions are also suggested by the joint control of Czech and German inspectors.
As an example of wrong practice, he refers to the approach of Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as to the so-called "svarc system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with its controls - is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law has to be set up somehow, and if something is forbidden, then the Prime Minister can not prevent the activities of the Office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce its duties," Kala said.
At the meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German parties, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation regulates how public contracts are handled, followed by individual national legislations and then by practice itself.
We have put all this together, and although the inspection is not yet completed, we have seen very interesting differences - in general terms, the legislation in our country is perhaps even "stricter and more perfect", but the practice itself is better in Germany in some parameters.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, but it is necessary to focus on the application of law itself.
What can this project really help you with, what does it mean for you?
It is this kind of joint control that could help us stop making efforts to clarify laws, reduce and improve limits when it does not have such a positive impact.
Economy means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always the lowest) price in order to exclude enrichment and possibly criminal conduct.
But by lowering the procurement limit, we don’t necessarily have to achieve that.
Maybe the system will get so full of "paper" that those who want to look for holes in the system will draw from it much easier than if the limit remained higher.
You are talking about domestic problems with the transposition of legislation on public procurement into practice.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it similar to ours, or is it different?
As far as the authorities are concerned, just as the SAO operates there, the Bundesrevisionshof, which is organized like us, also has a college, only formed in a slightly different way, but in principle both authorities act in a similar way.
The powers are also somewhat similar, but the fact that Germany has a federal arrangement means that it has these courts of account at the level of the individual federal states - in this the system differs a little from ours.
The BRH can only control the federal money represented by state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by our regions and municipalities, are controlled there from the level of federal accounting courts.
As far as legislation is concerned, it is easier than ours.
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific data, but in some respects Germany is often referred to as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in all respects.
Is it because they have better controllers?
Certainly not, but again, I don't like that kind of comparison.
But it must be said that even the countries that we consider to be a model face a number of problems.
Otherwise, it wouldn't be any good for them to work with our office, would it?
As for domestic legislation, what did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act mean for your office, do its effects already manifest themselves?
Since the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it is not yet manifested in our control actions.
Since we do ex-post checks, it is necessary to count on a certain delay.
We are only seeing this so far in the process of preparing future controls - we have launched our new tool "detection of risks of inefficiency", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analysed them - there, of course, these changes will be reflected, because the limits will change, the conditions of some types of tendering will be adjusted, and so on.
Do you consider the approval of this law to be a benefit or an additional burden on the system of bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope that this will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise here is that these rules will be "stricted" and will not be able to be observed.
For the functioning of the previous rules, the audited persons are obliged by the provider (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes, by the regional council) to ensure that any failure to comply with the law on public procurement constitutes a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse it, and not punish those who commit a formal error that does not affect decision-making.
Such a system will only put more pressure on bureaucracy.
So how do we get out of this?
Let's see where the road doesn't lead.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called "swartz system" - and what does that mean?
Is the blackout system banned or allowed?
After all, the law must be somehow set up, and if it forbids anything, then the Prime Minister cannot prevent the activities of the Office, which is obliged to go to control and enforce its duties.
He can say, "We'll change the law and allow it," but he can't say we'll do nothing.
There are fairly strict rules in the Public Procurement Act on how to formally implement what is right to protect public competition.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when an interested party with the best offer is excluded only for formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct - this is what we think is missing.
The roads are frozen, but mostly movable.
In several places in the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowed.
Most of the time, however, the roads are movable, somewhere with increased caution.
Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region this morning the roads were movable, but in some places they were frozen and also snowed.
The temperature dropped between five and ten degrees below zero, but it should warm slightly during the day.
Snow in the region has stopped and only a weak layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
Places were also less visible due to fog, according to the data of the regional road traffic controllers.
The R6 speedway and first-class roads are now unlimited in the region.
Caution, however, is in place, for example, on some bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
But in some parts of them there are still remnants of frozen and sometimes driven snow.
Especially in higher positions, it is necessary to pay increased attention to the ride.
Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové Region
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are threatened with frost, in higher positions and in the mountains there may be a snow layer on the roads, the Directorate of Roads and Highways reports on its website.
Motorists warn drivers against frost, it can be formed especially in higher positions of the Pardubice region.
It can be found around Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, especially on second and third class roads.
Chemically treated are roads I/43 and I/34 near Svitavy.
Snow is especially on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Eagle Mountains.
The snow layer is in the highest position on the roads in the districts Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today it is mostly clear to semi-clear with no precipitation.
Temperatures usually range between minus three and plus one degree Celsius, with a slight wind blowing.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen Region are movable this morning, but in some places with increased caution and driving needs to be adapted to the weather.
It is freezing in the morning, temperatures range between three to nine degrees below the freezing point.
After the previous snowfall and subsequent cooling, some communications may be frozen.
The driver must also be aware of the fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is according to the information of the regional traffic controllers.
The D5 motorway is almost unlimited, but caution is recommended by road managers between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frozen surface.
However, in southern Pilsen and Tachov there may be frozen stretches.
Communications of the second and third classes are damp, and also in this case, the warning of frozen sections applies.
Drivers should be careful especially on less frequented roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Today, drivers heading to the highest positions of the Olomouc Region have to count on snow mush on the road.
After the chemical sprinkling, she remained on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle and on the way to the Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> cross.
Snow chased the roadmen into the terrain at night, in <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, according to the road managers, it snowed about three centimeters.
In other parts of the region, roads are usually accessible without restrictions.
"In <0xC5><0xA0>umperk, in the highest positions lies the remains of snow.
With snow porridge on the <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorsk<0xC3><0xBD> saddle, drivers have to count in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," said today the <0xC4><0x8C>TK dispatcher of the <0xC5><0xA0>umperk road administration.
Their colleagues also set out for the field at night in Jesenicka, the roads to and from the highest positions are now, according to them, bare and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, roads are accessible without restrictions, but in <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk drivers should be careful in forest sections where roads have remained damp.
<0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj, Libereck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj
Several difficult-to-move places are reported by road users in northern Bohemia this morning.
In addition to a few places with infested snow or with a glacier, the mountain road from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice to <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed, according to the police database.
Temperatures are kept in lower positions below zero, so ice and snow are likely to last on the roads.On the contrary, there are no problems in the lowlands, especially southeast of the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD>ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> mountain range, and the roads are usually dry.
Operational complications have not yet been reported.
The occurrence of the glacier is reported by road users especially from the surrounding area of Szczeti.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for her were at night - during the day rain and melting snow, at night light and frost.
Unfavorable conditions are also reported from the main trains on the road I/13 on the border of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> and Liberec regions.
The closure from Telnice to Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice was forced by bent branches of trees, which bent down to the road under the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
It's just one of the other alarm messages that we humans like to catch.
“Together with The Tap Tap, we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will organize a completely unique project of three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce it to your readers?
This is a nationwide benefit event that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced on December 21st at 11:10 am.
The day before December 20, from 9 pm, 3 concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, which is in the time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally it was probably my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which we will one day pass this world on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also created a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags or original keys against the end of the world, which people can also support us by purchasing on www.e-tap.cz.
The Tap Tap, along with other artists, also sang the so-called "End of the World" anthem, which is called "End of the World Abrogated".
She is already very popular on YouTube, will she also be heard at these benefit concerts?
Of course, and in the end, if we succeed and the world does not end...
It is sung by all the performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The hymns are also suddenly connected in a unique live broadcast on Czech Television.
He wrote the words to this song, and the main role of Jesus in the clip is played by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k, in which Xindl X...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, considering that we organize a lot of benefit events and concerts...
We are working hard to get them involved in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and having fun.
What are the benefits of concerts to the end of the world?
To equip the barrier-free educational center Studeo, which we have been implementing for the sixth year with the civic association Tap in the Jedlicka Institute.
For students of Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Institute schools, lecturers come regularly and engage them in activities that amuse and interest them.
The students themselves do not have the means to present themselves as lecturers, so we try to make it possible for them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Institute in the future, a separate building will be created, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert, several musical groups and performers will perform.
What did you choose them for?
We have tried to create a program that will appeal to all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform in Prague.
Full details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning a similar "bombing" event in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, so we will definitely prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year, we would also like to play at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, when we are in the US, would like to associate it with a performance in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not minimalistic, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow, for example.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these paths logistically and organizationally?
It’s not as bad as it seems at first glance.
We have five members on the electric trolley, its trolleys have to travel in the luggage compartment, then, of course, we carry with us a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools...
However, so far it has always worked without problems, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were well prepared for us, that I was surprised many times.
Even in Moscow, from which we have recently returned, it was without problems.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare how each differs in barrier-freeness, public access to the disabled and the like.
What have you met so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in our country, we saw in Russia that in the East everything is still in full swing.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is a very barrier, it is still unusual for a person to move in an electric wheelchair alone in the city center.
There’s no such thing as the fact that you prefer a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there are already civil associations that are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the other hand, do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still behind...
However, it is important to mention that improving and improving the situation is always dependent on the efforts of the people concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move independently in public, to go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, on the contrary, we are a little ahead with The Tap Tap!
Respecting the public or being barrier-free is one thing, but only when we become important athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will things start to change for real.
So far, these are isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is very popular now, but let’s go back a few years, what made you start it in 1998?
I joined the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ek Institute as a teacher, where I had many young people around me who were interested in doing something.
And since I am a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, so I started an interesting music club together with a colleague.
Well, over time, as our presenter L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, it got a little out of hand (laughs).
But the popularity has only come in recent years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us when we started to connect with well-known singers and also actively work to promote the band.
We realized that the work that is not visible, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to contributions from the European Union, we can also afford quality lecturers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to pull it up with The Tap Tap so high?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to do something different.
Showbusiness is full of things where one imitates the other.
It’s kind of logical, everything new is taken care of and takes a long time.
There are very few things that are unique, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is, of course, regret, this is natural.
But that regret is absolutely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering from all the abandoned beings we have to regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, provided they have the necessary resources to do so.
I say that when something succeeds for people with disabilities, it is not just a shift for them, but for the whole society.
Did it also help that you are a strict boss, as many people have labeled you?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and require some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic imagination and a head in the clouds, and when they find that they have to go to the rehearsal twice a week, get on the preparation and spend a lot of time on the road to concerts, the enthusiasm will quickly leave them.
But this is how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and wants to achieve something.
Currently, The Tap Tap has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We are an open group, people leave and come, that cannot be stopped.
Who has the will and taste, always has the door open
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 from 9 pm
Incheba Arena, Brno Fléd and Ostrava Plynoye will be held in Prague with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic
At the end of the evening, all three cities will be connected by a telebridge during the joint singing of the song of the band The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to raise funds to equip the multifunctional barrier-free educational center STUDEO at the Jedlicka Institute in Prague in the amount of CZK 25 million
Admission to the concert is 400 CZK, children under 12 years have free tickets in the Bohemiaticket pre-sale
Poland and space.
Last week, at a meeting of European Space Agency Ministers, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 November 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of projects of the Agency.
However, Poland’s journey to space began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflights before World War II; but they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to recall, for example, A. Sternfeld’s lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, which on December 6, 1933 presented ideas from his pioneering work, Entry into Cosmonautics.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
Sternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in 1934 for his Entry into Space in France.
The mentioned doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books devoted to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagandist of cosmonautics, and his contribution was also appreciated by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925, a railway dredge was built in Poland, which was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of the proposal is not known and the details of the project are not known.
It is not even clear whether the missile should have been used to start the dredge or to brake it.
Information about this drezina is known only from the period press.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to be used with rocket missiles.
The research was provided by the Armament Technology Cell in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfek and Prof. Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the preserved materials, it is clear that the research has reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the design of the photoelectric fighter missile, designed by engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the professional press, and in the following year, the work Raketa - an air torpedo and an aerial bomb by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were designed for the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Temczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was involved in all projects of military use of missile technology, which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its activity ended the beginning of the war.
After the war, other works devoted to space exploration appeared in the Polish press thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the company is mentioned in the November issue of the 1954 issue of the journal Problemy, which contains four more comprehensive articles on astronautics.
In one of them, from Prof. M. Subotowicz, it is proposed to create a company that will deal with cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already underway, and it was clear that space research was a promising field.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) has been striving to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the PTA Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959) became the vice-chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful Meteorological Missile RM (Meteorological Missile), which became the first Polish rocket to conduct scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket with an access of 1800 meters was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were launched in the Bled Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next development type was supposed to be capable of real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket was supposed to have a range of up to 14.5 km and its task was to monitor the altitude wind.
However, in 1962, further development was suspended.
The successor to the first RM-type rocket was the Meteor-1 rocket developed from 1962 to 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm and the starting weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had 0.4 litres of space, the Meteor-1B had 0.34 litres, and the Meteor-1C had 0.62 litres.
The maximum access for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Aeronautical Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's accession to the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Poland was also involved in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites as part of the Intercosmos program, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remko.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The resolution sparked a lively debate in public.
It will certainly be interesting to look at the issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally oriented economic systems in the EU as well as in the globalized world are based on the principle of more, unregulated competition.
In its effect, this means that the individual economic units, the national economic systems, are in permanent conflict with each other.
The reason is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the significant differences in the price of labour, (wages) there is a price tension.
By this term it is necessary to understand the situation when a producer tries to withstand competition by importing cheap goods by "cheating up" the price of a competitor in order to take on a larger market share and thereby increase its own profits.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to transfer production abroad, or to buy cheaply there, or to disappear.The result is high unemployment in countries where labor prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the resulting unemployment, the social expenditures of the state necessarily increase.
The whole situation is enhanced by the complete reluctance of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the economic and social damage they caused in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The ruthless practices of private capital create a situation in individual economies where national governments are forced to enter into competition with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments are giving private capital a chance to its own population, regardless of social decline.
This is mainly reflected in the changes to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population to adopt a price dictate of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment, on the other, by restricting the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
The result is increasing poverty, coupled with an increase in the gap between the rich and the poor.
There have been public food dispensaries for the poor in Germany for many years, who cannot feed on their own work.
The number of these people is already in the millions.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is quite common for properly employed people to receive such wages that the state has to pay them to an existential minimum.
Such a scandal was published even in the case of auxiliary employees of the Federal Assembly.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern EU countries undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in the social level are forced either to emigrate as they were in the 19th century, or to live at starvation wages on the margins of society in the hope that private investment capital may one day enter the country.
But the question is where does it come from?
If it is from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, or Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, or Africans are still working for a fraction of the European wage.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media infuriately argue that the state cannot participate capitally in its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state must not intervene in the economy by directing interventions.
Then it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, now it actually manages politics and thus the whole state in its own egoistic sense.
Here is a clear answer that yes.
The evidence is the existence of a practically omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, providing mutual benefits, legislation where practically everything is criminal, but nothing is criminal.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries for lack of funds order the drafting of laws to private law firms, which are often associated with industry.
These bills are then approved in the Bundestag.
All power in this way does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions say, but from financially strong groups preferring their own interests.
It is clear that liberally oriented democracies are now quickly getting into a situation as Appianos describes it in his Crisis of the Roman Republic under Caesar and Pompey: “The state has long been in complete disintegration and the authorities have been occupied by violence.
For bribes, for unlawful gain of favor, and with the help of stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption were rampant without any hindrance, and the people went to the elections with a pre-sold vote" ..."characteristic people did not run for office at all, so one day as a result of this breakdown was to stand eight months without consuls." .."It began to talk about the fact that the only cure in a bad situation is self-government, and that a man needs to be elected."
As in antiquity, modern society is based on a reckless preference for self-interest, regardless of the social interest.
Private capital is no longer, by its very nature, capable of understanding and applying the whole-society benefit.
The result is now, as at the time, an unprecedented decadence of elites without any deeper reform efforts.
We must therefore look for the causality of the rise of fascist and communist regimes in the ruthless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
In the current situation, the demise of these systems in favor of a liberal democracy can be considered a certain break with the expectation of the next round.
Particularly disastrous is the fact that the current elites completely ignore in the future the possible hundreds of thousands of lives lost, humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing together with crimes against humanity, as we know them from old and new history.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and internal European level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the state's capital participation in the economy, strengthen the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will come out of violence and never can" Sting in Fragile whose main line in the chorus is "Let's not forget how fragile we are"
"If my sons did not want war, there would be no" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild in 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, a lot of reactions have emerged.
Some stand behind Israel, argue its right to self-defense, and the Palestinians fit into the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, argue the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel fit into the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who is in the periodic waves of killing by the culprit and who is the victim, after all, today's residents of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence.
My point is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look at who is primarily served by the already 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reflections are supported by available historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first and foremost, the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find a certain Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether it was always these personalities who were completely autonomous in their actions, or whether there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards a predetermined goal.
We must admit that we live in a time when the world’s wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power could not have taken place in the life of one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the head of an octopus (if anyone is still standing above them I do not know, but I do not exclude it) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
The first news agency (Reuters) was bought as early as the 1990s to stop linking its name to the highly criminal acts it was behind, which always meant for them the consolidation of power, the multiplication of wealth, or both.
They have major stakes in almost all central banks of the world and against countries where shares in the central bank are not conducted or preparing wars (before the attack on Afghanistan it was 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq it was 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia subordinated the central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to restore the status of the Rothschild Bank of America, began issuing his own (meaning government) money during the Civil War, and was murdered in 1865 in a theater.
JFK began issuing its own money and wanted to abolish the Fed, it was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for the outbreak of the Great Depression in 1929.
Their desire for global power led from 1859 to 1871 to formulate a plan for the three world wars by the Freemason of the highest, 33rd degree consecration by Albert Pike.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist state units in Europe, the second was to eliminate the colonial possessions in particular of Great Britain, and the third was to reduce the world population somewhere to 0.5 - 1 billion people (so many slaves for their comfort and luxury are enough and do not consume so many resources), the creation of one universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a prelude to such a solution) and the final takeover of absolute power.
The method that a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, work is to provoke a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the establishment of the Fed, so as not to repeat crises such as those triggered in 1907).
So, after they managed to unleash the First World War by assassinating the Habsburg successor to the R-U throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by launching the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded capitulation of Germany (no longer needed a war to destroy Tsarist Russia) and the subsequent fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
In order to facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers of politics had to create a latent conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the premise of radicalization of the impoverished masses, and then they just had to push the Germans strong enough, the culprits indicating and simple solutions offering the Leader, and then the creation of a multi-ethnic strong Czechoslovakia.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the establishment of the Zionist Movement, whose one branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration created a precondition for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
World War II broke out, whether Hitler pulled himself out of the chain on which the international bankers initially held him, or whatever he had planned was hard to guess, in any case the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the precondition for the acceptance of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations to Germany had caused World War II, the declaration of the State of Israel created the focal point of World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in the latter, will be victims in the first line of battle, now together with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of quarrel and chaos not only within the country, but also on an international scale (let’s just take a look at how sharply people are divided into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where injustice breeds injustice in an endless chain of violence, when the greed of individuals and their desire for global power were at the beginning of everything?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the common people of Israel from their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers encourage people to choose only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, Netanyahu’s hawk, is a typical example of a fascist and a global banker loyal to him, a politician who does everything to unleash a war with Iran, which, given Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), threatens to escalate into a global conflict.
In 1994, David Rockefeller said, “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in their vision is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves the comforts of a handful of financial aristocracy.
A world where every newly born individual is implanted at birth with a chip that will make him a totally controlled being.
“And he compels all the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the slaves, to have a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, so that they cannot buy or sell, who are not marked by the name of the beast or by the number of his name.
This is to be understood: whoever has reason, let him count the digits of the beast.
The number indicates a person, and it is the number six hundred and sixty-six."
Argo: When It's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the ousted Shah Mohammed Reza P<0xC3><0xA1>hlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been the patron of his regime for several decades.
For the US administration, the situation did not offer a positive outcome - she could not afford to throw a shah overboard, because it would fundamentally jeopardize the trust of allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution resulted in the establishment of a theocratic regime, was not able to achieve.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later deepened by the fiasco of the attempt to free the hostages by force.
The incarcerated diplomats were eventually released after 444 days, after negotiations were brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate at home has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment.
Debacle in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director Ben Affleck's film Argo chronicles an episode of the story that brought America a small victory.
Just before the embassy was occupied, six employees fled.
After difficult peripeti, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story - they went on Canadian passports as members of the film staff, who in the country inspected the locations for filming sci-fi big films.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by Tony Mendez, an expert on “exfiltration,” also required Hollywood’s cooperation.
To make the legend credible, a film project was written in specialized magazines, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have been kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is a strange combination of multiple genres.
On the one hand, a realistically conceived political thriller, at the same time the so-called "caper movie", a story of a successful piece, a trick - an example can be the series of Danny's partners.
In the film, moods alternate - on the one hand, documentary sequences from Tehran (in the subtitle sequence, iconic period photographs of events are shown, as well as the way in which the same situations were presented in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lighter passages from Hollywood, reconciled with irony and a slight exaggeration.
And then there's scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions-- men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, in the corridors of the office, on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to relaunch his career in a remarkable way.
The ridiculed actor became a respected director and his acting ceased to be the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film, after the dark crime film Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
It is also Affleck's first film not to feature in the director's hometown of Boston.
At the same time, the feeling for the atmosphere of the place was among the characteristics that raised the director's older films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck also shows it in Arg, where Tehran "plays" Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place in the streets, reconstructing real events - the opening sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive in its clarity, which at the same time mediates the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that occur when history suddenly moves somewhere.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his collaborators in fictional scenes (a fake staff at a Tehran bazaar).
Too many stories in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story told does not actually offer much in the film sense of tense scenes.
He works quite successfully with it, sometimes he comes up with something to reality - there everything is not so elegant (a scene in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport turns off the phone call in America and the chase after the runway seems quite drawn by the hair).
The weakness of Arga, however, is the distraction resulting from the need to show too many stories in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in the roles of Hollywood collaborators, but their characters would deserve more space and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film somewhat loses its dramatic thrust, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciate the realization and retro style evoking the thrillers of the 70s.
But it's hard to pull.
As a reminder of one so far living history in a certain way, and proof of how exaggerated the notions of all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipo<0xC5><0x82>oky.com, which annually announces a survey on the most absurd bank fee, has now decided to announce a competition for "the most absurd regulation or ideas from the EU workshop".
"We were led by the latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the leadership of large European companies," said Pravva poll organizer Patrik Nacher.
Among the nominated absurdities, for example, is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the unification of the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
So far, women have benefited from life insurance prices because they are objectively less risky for insurance companies.
“Another incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The vote itself will then take place by the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulation includes mandatory blending of bio-based components into fuels, which is detrimental to nature, a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain relatively small amounts of a dangerous substance, or the chicken cage size directive, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
Criticism has also previously been faced by the factual ban on the use of the term butter spread or the elimination of classic bulbs from sale.
High-quality bananas are 14 centimeters long.
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby, whose demands in Brussels are usually defended by a state or a group of states (so now the Czech Republic is also threatening to veto the demands of its banks).
The interest of the lobby was also that, for example, bananas of the highest quality had to reach a length of at least 14 cm in the Union and were not allowed to show "anomalous curvature".
The European Commission has defended itself by merely harmonising existing disparate national standards that have complicated trade.
The EU has already softened its standards on fruit and vegetables, despite resistance from some countries, with the indication that the existing directives lead to food waste.
A candidate for the poll may also be the last year's EU regulation, according to which inflatable balloons sold must be notified that children under the age of 8 must not be inflated without adult supervision.
The EU has invoked U.S. research that says toy balloons are the leading cause of death for strangulation children.
A similar restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing into pilgrimages.
Curious ideas are born at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is also quite absurd - anyone who has an official position in the EU cannot use the name Macedonia, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, and must speak instead of it of the FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, the server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poklaky.com nominated for the survey, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has set the maximum volumes of food stocks that could be located on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the Union.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volumes for preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a high fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies to applications for subsidies.
However, these ideas did not originate in Brussels, but in Prague.
"We are handicapped because we don't have the sea.
We will ask the European Union for a refund," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he said that a lot of grain was born in our country, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, he had to stand full of warehouses, which he had to export.
For the fact that the Czech Republic continues to have ports, according to Palas, the EU should have paid us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic by organising a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The subsidy for the grant was offered to municipalities by the Ministry of Regional Development, managed by Minister Pavlo N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), specifically to write a request for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although the regulations are easily criticised in the Member States, the EU's efforts to regulate and, at the same time, to make the Union as a whole more efficient and develop, they deserve rather recognition, according to a number of experts.
A more serious problem, according to experts, is the use of EU subsidies for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which were forced by the Member States during the budgetary negotiations.
The fact that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to specific labelling of its traditional products is also a source of emotion among the Czechs, although it will not always succeed in this match.
Although the Czechs, after a six-year struggle with the Germans and Austrians, defended the designation of Olomouc cheesecakes, the domestic rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed into domestic rum.
The names of rum can only be carried by products made from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered EU products, the company of world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from the German Lübeck and Parma hams have already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary biscuits, pogorelica and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBD>atec hops.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and go<0xC5><0x99>ice tubes.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Mr. Senator, how do you know if you want to run for president?
It's not about being a senator or a president.
If it worked without problems in our country, I would not be running anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country being robbed for the last twenty years, the thieves running around, the taxes being raised and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to figure out how to change it.
And since I'm 40 and I'm an independent non-partisan, I have no choice but to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but soon you went to the Castle.
Do you turn your back on the people who elected you?
I've been saying all along that I'm going to fight for the Castle based on the result of the Senate election.
Later, I specified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not a function, a function is a tool for how I can realize my vision.
That is why I need as much influence and as strong a mandate as possible.
The problem, however, is not only that as a nation we revile in the pub and on TV, but that we trample on anyone who wants to try to change.
To this will be added the media, which dehonests man and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it was claimed that I bribed a journalist or that I was an advisor to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's go to your visions.
In the fight for the Castle, you set out with the thesis of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and the return of property confessions of over twenty million.
You have to change the law.
As president, however, you have no such authority, and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for free trade as a guide, I was able to enforce it.
The problem is politics - when someone comes up with a good proposal from the left or the right, they are deliberately rejected, and this is holding back citizens.
As an independent non-partisan, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that without party boxing and dogma I can take something that is best for our country from every side and apply it.
Do you consider yourself to be a right-wing or left-wing person?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people are turning me more to the left.
It doesn’t matter if it’s a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
I don’t care if someone is on the left or on the right, but I want to connect people.
I will always support any public good solution, even if it is proposed by the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the ODS, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You're cursed when someone says you're a populist.
But you're not proving it by what you said?
When you create a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and vision.
And that's what you're trying to get close to.
Some might call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about are already working in the world, or they've been talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will only have passwords.
This will not be enough for you in the long run.
Or do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will be able to enforce, for example, criminal and material responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to push it through.
If I were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast, where I would ask the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate substantive and criminal liability for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they might have to tell you why they don't want her.
When there is a strong personality who will name bad things, you can push on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president, it was due to public pressure.
To be honest, I'm an amateur, I'm neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and visions, I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and I will try to get the majority support for my programme.
I'm trying to move things on my own, if it doesn't work out, I'll be done in six years, and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything in one person, so I've circumvented a number of famous people to see if they'd run for the Senate as well.
I went to Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, who refused because of the amount of work.
So at least I supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorenco, who was exposing the scams with light fuel oils.
I've run for office saying people are really unhappy, but now I'm in trouble.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and those who went chose the representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people have appointed the Senate so that changes will be difficult to enforce.
Yet I will fight for my visions, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering starting your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet, because I don’t have time to examine the pure past of every potential party, and I don’t have the money to do it either.
I don't even have the money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
Are you talking about property claims, what is yours?
I estimate private property to be about $60 million.
In Prague I have a plot of land for about 25 million, an apartment for ten million, another apartment for eight million, a collection of works of art for about ten million, Aston Martin for 3.5 million and <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb for a million and then I have a few million in my account.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my boyhood dream - I always liked James Bond, who rode in the car, was gallant towards women and at the same time fought against badness and badness.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have $60 million worth of property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to put your own money into it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already hit $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors suggests that my program may not be that interested.
And I'm not obligated to pay for my campaign.
The cost of the campaign will essentially cover what I'm getting for the senator's salary.
But I couldn't make it out of it, for example, I couldn't pay my son an English school that costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
So you're gonna keep doing business so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to stifle these activities?
But it has nothing to do with salary.
As I promised, I partially muted my activities.
For example, my representative will become the travel manager in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who will save the republic.
But I also need to live from something.
How much are you used to taking per month as an entrepreneur?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I take on.
And if I were president, I would end my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the Right.
MVRDV architects are proof that real adventures don’t just happen in the head – for example, Spijkenisse and the recently built Mountain of Books – 2 photos
"The building looks cheerful, futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, who walks around on the side of the road.
Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a nearby big business, says, "Of course, the house is nice."
I wonder why we still need a library.
They all have internet, iPads and e-books.
Nobody goes to any of these old-style libraries voluntarily anymore, right?
Spijkenisse, a settlement in the immediate vicinity of Rotterdam without its own job opportunities, which are not even worth a visit, holds a special record.
With a population of 80,000, this municipality has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To resolve this stupid situation, a few years ago a decision was made to contribute to general education and to build seven beautifully painted reinforced concrete miniatures of fictitious bridges depicted on euro banknotes.
However, the success of the educational offensive was not dizzying.
And so the city councillors realized that there was only one way to become masters of statistics: we must have a library!
Winy Maas of the MVRDV Rotterdam architectural studio, master of insanely daring column charts and the maker of funny, often even cynical constructions, accepted the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at a competition meeting in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the commission looked around in amazement and shrugged, the insolent Maas threw his gifts at himself according to size, and ended his activist-motivated speech with the words "Dear Town Township!"
So this is my proposal for the Mountain of Books at Spijkenisse, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain was completed for 30 million euros.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, Mountain of Books was awarded the second place "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Small-town grey, which could not yet offer more than a postmodern pedestrian zone and an unusually ugly town hall, behind whose white facade you would rather expect a dairy, is richer with a bit of contemporary architecture.
Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: a reader's eldorado under the hatch for cheese.
Although there is an elevator through the massif of the mountain, you will discover real spatial and reader’s passions only when you cross the topography on foot.
On all sides, the glazed interior is bright and clear, the floor of the burnt cabrine and the elegant street lanterns clearly express the atmosphere of the public square.
The urban environment is perfect.
You see park benches, a dog and boys and girls playing football.
And books, books, books everywhere.
“Normally there are shelves with books along the facade and in the middle is a large dark space that is mostly uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
We put the classic spatial configuration upside down and pushed the space for the reader from the inside out.
The interior of the Mountain of Books is cleverly used: in the center there are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an ecological center and a headquarters of home technology.
A special delight are black bookshelves, which are once a wall cladding, once a window sill and sometimes a railing of the stairs.
Appearance, structure and smell are foreign.
Even architects and civil engineers have vowed to shake their heads over the unknown building material.
“We wanted to work here with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse, when asked by Standard magazine.
So one day, at a Frisian farm, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a millimeter fleece made of synthetic material has been used as a base under the roots.
It is cheap and time efficient.
Thin textiles last one, two seasons and then are ripe for disposal in bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in such quantity - was pressed onto boards four centimeters thick.
With the action of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous and load-bearing material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you will reach the top.
At the end of the nearly 500-metre journey, you will be rewarded with a fantastic view of the city, as well as Dutch croquettes and figs in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, but mainly about the correct humidity of the air in the mountains of literature.
Gifts for a new soul
“You probably wouldn’t believe it, but this house, despite its many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled by the heat of the earth.
Although the Mountain of Books stands under a glass lid, the sun shines inside only briefly, even on sunny days.
Wide glued wooden trusses, standing perpendicular to the glazed facade, serve as a shading and capture a large part of the sun's radiation.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest can be done with fully automatic roller shutters.
Stefan Spermon, an initial skeptic from the IT industry, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And also the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who Boekenberg even calls the "long-awaited soul" Spijkenisse.
The reason: every resident of the city was invited to the opening a few weeks ago to donate one book from his personal fund.
First, the optical gaps were to be filled in the not yet fully equipped library, which currently has 70,000 pieces.
The concept has proven itself.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship to the new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it was just an ornament.
Thus, the MVRDV succeeded in the royal discipline, which in professional jargon is called the formation of identity.
Spijkenisse wrote the history of literature.
No matter how young or uneducated he is.
This is the starting point for identity.
Szabo: "The Germans have a bigger role to play"
Germany abstained in the decision to accept Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on the narrow edge of diplomacy.
Deutsche Welle: Germany first signaled earlier this week that it would vote against a proposal for observer status for Palestinians in the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from voting.
What's wrong?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis did in Gaza.
Now, of course, Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it will support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This was eventually achieved by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance on serious international issues?
Yes, it is.
The reason is that he is just changing his foreign policy, from a policy that was, so to speak, governed by the United States, to a German foreign policy.
The situation is all the more difficult because Europeans do not have a coherent and unified policy.
The Germans are on two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are just getting settled in their role, but they are on their way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
To the foreign policy they have in France or in the UK.
What exactly does "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It demonstrates readiness to take positions that are independent of the positions of the US or European partners in the case of national interests.
I think that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, i.e. exports and its relations with certain areas, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are to some extent different from the economic interests of other powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did economic interests influence the position in the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
Firstly, Germany has large sales outlets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf states.
Therefore, they must be careful not to intimidate the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries.
Anyway, that plays a role.
I would not like to attach too much importance to this, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
However, this plays an important role in German thinking.
Did it damage Germany’s relations with the US when Germany abstained in both important decisions, such as in the vote on Palestine?
I think that in Europe and even in the USA there is a great understanding of the German attitude.
That is why I do not think it was such a dramatic breakthrough as it was on the Libya issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect from this.
This indicates that he must be considered an international player and his interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The United States, on the other hand, has spoken out against the veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These differences have always existed as a result of U.S. domestic policy.
I think that the Obama administration has a great deal of secret understanding of the European position.
But as a result of the political situation there, of course, this position cannot be taken publicly.
I don’t think the differences of opinion are as great as they always seem.
When you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not very enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies at all.
Is it not difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and with the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
This is what makes it difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and unified European policy, which is not happening at the moment.
They cannot therefore be part of a wider line and must instead drive things forward from their own position.
That’s what they do with the euro.
I believe that Germany will take the lead in the future and push Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive topic.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they have to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player? Does it even want to take on the lead role?
Or is the leadership role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and for obvious reasons it is still difficult to play a bigger role for this country.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, every time Germany takes on a larger role, anti-German sentiments arise.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
It is actually an old problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be acceptable to all sorts of neighbors and opinions, and it is not easy.
The influence of the US in European politics is now constantly declining, but the EU is not currently filling this vacuum.
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, it makes them uncomfortable and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Market Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are suddenly Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and Polo Ralph Lauren is one of them.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this is a designation that is completely officially registered in China, but has nothing to do with the original company.
However, they are protected as long as they are not sued by the real owners of the brand.
And even then it is not clear whether justice can be done.
“For foreigners, it’s becoming increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing’s office, which specializes in violations of rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
Counterfeiters only need a few extra letters to sign up for their brands.
For example, the Gucci brand will become Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada they will have Prada-Kny registered.
In this way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the stamp office records in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company was allowed there to protect the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that also parasitizes the Ermenegildo Zegna fashion house.
The Chinese are known to be world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In large cities, there are several-storey department stores, in which counterfeits are almost exclusively sold.
But Pattloch's cases are different, and he's acting on behalf of his mandates to prevent Chinese companies from officially being given the right to use a mark that's already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", an associated brand.
This word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
This is what they mean by women who hunt rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
"It's damaging business, we have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The mark will dilute, the exclusive status will disappear, the damage to the image is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries go to millions, especially for expensive sample products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China is the third-largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing market, with a volume of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion per year.
However, deleting dubious entries in the register of brands can be difficult to achieve and it costs something.
The procedure can last up to nine years, with uncertain results.
Pattloch recounts cases in which the court dismissed the lawsuits because the reproached name became a "market reality" after a long period of time.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he has to pay the plagiarist because he damaged his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes there's the law of the jungle.
Well-known cases also apply to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that recently took over German concrete mix pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
For this reason, the Chinese are still allowed to use an emblem that resembles a Mercedes star.
Geely, which bought Volvo, originally used a blue-and-white logo that resembled BMW. The dispute was settled, Geely had to change the logo.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China with counterfeiters from Hong Kong and Singapore, who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
Although the CTMO acknowledges that there were shortcomings in 2010 due to too few staff and space.
But last year, “the course of the work process returned to normal from an emergency situation.”
For example, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings fell by 22%.
57,000 of these cases were closed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
There are still 81,500 complaints pending.
Something to do about it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, these are impressive numbers.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
This is a record, and it means that China is holding a list of new applications worldwide for the tenth consecutive time.
This also applies to the number of all valid trademarks - there are a total of 5.5 million of them.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan were collected on fees.
In simple terms, this means that each application costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth several times to start a dispute against this, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
The group has been fighting the Chinese plagiarist for more than seven years.
Although the Germans have achieved the abolition of its illegal production of imitation automotive parts.
However, the counterfeiter still secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
We would have missed it ourselves, because in Germany the surname cannot be protected, says Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the Munich company’s objection.
In the other two instances, Freudenberg was able to obtain the rights, but the opponent in the dispute continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful
The case is now being heard in the Supreme Court.
Wentzler has confidence that the matter will lead to a good end and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “Drive is extremely expensive and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs cannot be quantified. In the archives of the company, they even had to look through 100-year-old files to submit evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg in vain offered a "high six-digit sum in euros" to the opposing party to settle the dispute.
"You can see from this what it means to us," says Wentzler.
The danger from the Far East is also threatening to affect Europe.
And that's in case the imitators get unprotected marks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg label for footwear and leather in Germany.
This area of business was abandoned long ago by the group, but it managed to deter registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler says.
He and lawyer Pattloch advise German businesses to be very careful when dealing with China.
It is not enough to rely on international stamp rights; rather, foreigners should "report everything worth protecting in China in any way," Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg succumbs to the brand in the last act of its drama, then it is likely that it will have to pay license fees for its own name to the counterparty, Wentzler explains.
Or we will be pushed out of the market in the contested segment.
World AIDS Day: Hitting, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, Imbongi is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, orphans after parents who have died of AIDS are happy about it.
The story of the connection, which exceeds much more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is the kicking: cowboy high boots, basketball shoes, women's boats and men's moccasins are looking for a beat on the dance floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Then, slowly, the voices of the singers—alt, bass, tenor, and soprano—urge, mum, and pursue each other.
29-year-old conductor Fiete Hopf is almost lifted from his textile shoes as he joins his voices with his sleek wild gestures.
It's Monday night in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, where the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty singers and singers between the ages of 23 and 69, from the researcher of human genetics to the janitor, came.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each choral voice has a different text and even more so in a very foreign language - the Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Help with self-help
Unaids, the United Nations’ AIDS program, estimates that there are approximately 34 million people worldwide who are infected with HIV.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland, there are 245,000 orphans after parents who died of AIDS.
HIV-positive people are now more than 40 percent of the population.
For 180 orphans after their parents who died of AIDS, Voices for Africa found patrons in Germany.
70 of them attend second grade school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child tuition, school uniform and one hot meal a day in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "story teller" or "he who glorifies" in the Zulu language.
No one can speak gassy Bantu in this space, just sing.
For almost a decade now, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign soft language and sometimes also bringing them back to where they originally came from: South Africa.
At an air distance of 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Swaziland, there is the village of Esitenji, which depends on the volume of the German choir.
40% are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay or straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to HIV.
In Esitenji, it can be seen in the small scale of Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Male foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the virus of weakened immunity in them. It is not uncommon that they die in less than thirty years.
This village was discovered by a congregation on a joint trip through Africa in the spring of 2005, but above all, Imbongi members saw many children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but everything: food, clothing, education.
Without schooling, they have no chance at all in a poor country.
Initially, it was still a private engagement of individuals, which for a few euros per year allowed to send a child to school and give him one warm meal a day.
However, a year later, Voices for Africa was founded, which has since taken care of orphans after parents who died of AIDS, almost professionally.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most serious sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial SPIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral SPIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, herpes genitalis, or hepatitis.
Mushrooms and scabies belong to the parasitic SPI.
Who belongs to the group of the most affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur primarily in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases that occur frequently include chlamydia infections, trichomonas, candidiasis (mould), gonorrhea, and human papillomaviruses.
HIV is relatively low among heterosexual adults in our country, but about 20 percent of people newly infected with HIV belong to this group.
Among adolescents, chlamydial infections occur significantly more often than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses often occur among adolescents.
How did the number of infections develop?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases need to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of people infected with syphilis more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of people newly infected with HIV has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That’s about one-tenth less than a year ago.
What are the symptoms of sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, difficulty urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain unnoticed.
How is it possible to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
Because the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be partially transmitted even by infection from impurities and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend, especially in the case of frequent alternation of sexual partners, regular examinations.
In the case of early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most of the SPI and prevent later consequences.
Thanks to the patronage, charitable donations, and last but not least the fees the choir earns by singing throughout Germany, some money will be raised.
"We have already sent around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200,000 in total to Esiteni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
The money from Germany is managed in the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a confident woman who can push herself.
He also cares for orphaned children to find shelter, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogo, as the Zulu language calls old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them even took 14 orphans, gave them a roof over their heads and made sure that the children arrived every day in uniform to school.
Children who no longer have anyone go to the shelter to visit Khanyisile, a lonely woman who is paid by the association as well as two cooks who cook daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the U.S. health organization PSI, arranged for many people in the village to take an HIV test.
It's not self-evident, even though the disease is so obvious all over the country, everyone is silent about it.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is absolutely taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
In fact, it's pretty weird in a country where the king officially keeps 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his restless lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This state-approved way of life also bears the blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also many migrant workers who spread the virus on the ground.
Annette Lennartz says that condoms are free on every corner, "but no one uses them.
Culture is different - unprotected intercourse."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels once every two, three years together across southern Africa and sings songs full of sadness, combativeness, confidence in the future and self-confidence of blacks, which many in the southern tip of the black continent have known since the apartheid era.
A bus full of white people singing songs in the speech of blacks - such an award brings not only mood and joy, but also has already shed tears among many wild border soldiers.
The path always leads to Esitenji, where the singers visit the children, over whom they have patronage.
Although this village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than famous in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitenji, there's light," people say.
And when you go back to Heidelberg, which is a 8733-kilometer line from here, to the drumming singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see that the light is shining here, too.
NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could be as thick as 20 meters.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday by the expert magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the region of this planet, which lies in permanent shadow.
It is said to be at least 30 centimeters long and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
This water appears to have come from comets or perhaps even asteroids that hit Mercury.
But let’s not put the ice finding in the context of the existence of life on this planet, said Sean Solomon, the head of the scientists working on the Messenger spacecraft.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help explain how water and other essential elements of life got into other areas of the solar system.
Space probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix, unobserved Earthers, are involved in exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, images will be sent to Earth, a small window into infinite distances.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German scientists at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun beyond Neptune, Ceres, according to the International Astronomical Union's 2006 definition, is not a "planet".
This clipping from an infrared image of Spitzer's telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars. The oldest stars look like blue dots, less easily identifiable are the pink-colored "newborns" in the birth hall of the stars.
This region where stars form — scientists call it W5 unromantically — was discovered by Spitzer’s telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This changing heat of a dying star was captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The udolkov<0xC3><0xBD> ring consists of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, which is 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from the gas and dust.
The image of the galactic "cradle" was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the "Seven Sisters", is visible to the naked eye at night.
However, thanks to the telescope, the colors will stand out better.
The Helix Nebula may look like a red eye to the observer in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years from the constellation Aquarius.
Its similarity to the terrestrial continent brought to this nebula the naming of North America.
The combination of normal and infrared photography is the cause of an unusual coloration.
This "baby" among the stars was captured in full beauty by infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they formed is one of the greatest astronomical mysteries.
This is probably the remains of Saturn's moon, which disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: a vortex galaxy
Images of spiral galaxies become real works of art as they become colored.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the several thousand light-years distant Trifid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three parts, tricuspid), because the dark stripes of dust divide the burning heart of this starry obstetrics into three parts.
In the constellation of the Serpent, astronomers have photographed the forerunner of a cosmic collision: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies are colliding and must inevitably collide.
This birth was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Anyone who doesn’t like technical abbreviations can call it the South Windmill.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows an image of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cephea.
This 1,400-light-year-old nebula is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than normal domestic dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes that is 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
This larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The cradle of stars gives rise to new additions.
Also, these stellar clouds, associated with the Rosette Nebula, give birth to ever-new young stars, 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is still no dust, only gas.
Scientists believe that it was created only shortly after the Big Bang, when the entire universe was predominantly hydrogen.
Our views of space: the most important telescopes
The telescope was supposedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, who used it a year later to observe stars before Galileo Galilei.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have been increasing - and the views they convey are getting deeper.
The largest telescope in the world for 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, was the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego.
The mirror in this picture had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of Gran Telescopio Canarias on one of the Canary Islands - La Palma is huge. Only the mirror measures an average of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Its diameter is about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap method of construction: the telescope is secured by a hook at a height angle, thereby limiting its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at a height angle.
Its peculiarity is the high amplification of the luminous flux.
This, despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror, equals the largest mirror telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, scientists in space are searching for extraterrestrial signals.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
When "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) - the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - can help any computer owner who will make available its computing power.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
There's the Very Large Telescope, and it honors its name.
This telescope with a total of four mirrors can illuminate even the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at ESO’s Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror is to be 42 meters full and is to be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, images can be counted as early as 2018.
Two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world until 2007.
They offer two mirrors, each with a diameter of ten meters.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which also uses the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes to look into space.
Also on Mauna Kea is to be created a new giant telescope - with a 30-meter diameter mirror.
You can admire it here in the picture.
However, the most significant impressions from space are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
It has been providing us with images of distant worlds since April 24, 1990.
The Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets since March 2009 - especially those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 candidate planets had been identified since the start of the mission.
The image documents the last preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space aboard the Ariane5 rocket in 2018.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that there is ice at the South Pole of Mercury.
However, there are no reliable data for this, as Messenger orbits around this planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have shown that there is ice on Mercury for several decades.
Thanks to the Messenger probe, which was launched in 2004 and is the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident.
Drink butter every day and you will live to be 168 years old.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the Biblical age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people will live to the Biblical age.

Looking for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
Riding the Talysh mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The microbus roars along the road with many turns along densely wooded hills, predatory rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, it almost seems that we are in the Black Forest.
However, this is the farthest south of Azerbaijan, and the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian Talysh ethnic group lives, of which little is known, except that they speak both Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and live to a very high age.
The final stop is Lerik.
This town boasts too monumental architecture from Soviet times, which somehow does not fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe do not come here. Arrival from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too difficult.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, because the road is only single-lane.
The fairy-tale wealth that the country owes to oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived in the countryside.
Pilate Fatulayev, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was celebrated by the Eurovision Song Contest Grand Prix in May - and we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world next year," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of almost eight dozen Talysh from the surroundings, who are over one hundred years old. Fatulayev shows a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he gave birth to a child.
The museum’s controversial star, however, is sheep herder <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, the birth certificate does not exist.
And given that the oldest person with documents was 122 years old, Müslüm’s age seems extremely doubtful.
"He was born in this area in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
This man was reportedly married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he reportedly still had a daughter.
Didn't <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov make a mistake at his age by a few decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
“Obviously, many elderly people also live in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of evidence, no scientific proof of age can be provided, especially when there are no matrices.
Every day a glass of dissolved butter
The fact is, however, that people in the area around Lerico experience the Biblical age remarkably often.
Currently, there are 20 people who are over 100 years old.
Why are there so many elderly people in the South?
The Azerbaijani guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the Fatuleva Museum, on the contrary, believes that it lies in nutrition.
However, the fact that it is the calorie diet of Talysh people who love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of whom drink a glass of dissolved butter every day, is so healthy, from a bromatological point of view, it does not seem plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a small village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayev.
At 97 years old, it is still relatively young for this latitude.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house that is typical of the entire Caucasus region.
He sits on the ground with buttermilk, which he tirelessly swings.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayev’s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
There are also two small children around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests, which is served in typical belly-shaped glasses "armada".
Mirzaeva’s white teeth make up the perfect line and she hides a long dark blonde copy beneath her scarf, which her son proudly reveals in front of us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it didn’t look like it and kept its color.
"I've never used shampoo either," Mirzaeva says.
A monthly pension is enough.
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I haven’t bought food in a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells me about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was during World War II.
But everything improved when the paddle was taken over by the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev.
Propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the cult that takes place around the figure of the father of nations, who ruled his country as a dictator, knows no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over the oars.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan are not in need.
Mirzaeva receives a monthly pension of 230 manats (approximately the same amount in euros). This is an amount of money that can be used to make a good living here.
And perhaps Mirzayev’s long-greyed son is right: “Old people enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They live in the middle of a big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
If there's no reason to stay alive for as long as possible
The concept of "human rights" in the Constitution is missing
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Disputed demonstrations in Cairo have exposed the country’s deep divisions.
A future constitution based on Sharia law is being vigorously debated.
The Egyptian president did not spare pathos.
We need to create a transition.
"And I am responsible for this, in front of the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole nation, but above all to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
All of them, still hopelessly disputing in the confused opposition, are afraid.
The fear of the “state of God” on the Nile, betrayed to the mighty Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi almost apologised for temporarily limiting the powers of the constitutional court and expanding his powers to “save the revolution.”
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians and the world are not clear about.
Should the judiciary be stripped of power?
The 234 articles that the 100-headed Constituent Assembly, dominated by Islamists, hastily approved in a 15-hour night marathon, are partly of concern.
As in previous constitutions, it is said in this proposal that jurisdiction is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use this vague formulation and the associated legal free space for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
At the very least, the newly added paragraph sheds light on this: In all matters relating to Sharia, it is necessary to consult with Al-Azhar University, which is the most important Islamic institution in the country with a great influence on the whole of Sunni Islam.
This may not be the case, but it may mean that the clergy will supervise the legislation, which would give the judiciary a de facto renunciation of the rule of law.
There is a lot of interpretation in the Constitution.
The problem is also that the civil jurisdiction of the military courts must continue to be maintained.
These courts served under Mubarak's government to suppress the opposition.
After the fall of the dictatorship, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
As the proposal states, the state should also protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values”.
This is so inaccurately formulated by law that, by means of this paragraph, state institutions could even control the content of film art and literature.
In comprehensible language, this means nothing more than censorship.
Indeed, no paragraph in writing expressly defines equality between men and women.
However, another paragraph forbids defaming or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his envoys.
It is not clear what the punishment is and how it will be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording that "insulting people" is prohibited.
Is it enough in this case a cartoon of the president or a joke at the expense of legal experts?
The matter of interpretation, like many others in this proposal, which Morsi will put forward for signature and, in his words, will "very soon" present to the Egyptians for the purpose of a popular vote.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks now, opposition has been forming against the excess of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the constitutional charter before it even went into effect.
"The revolution is back and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was in third place in the presidential election.
Nobel laureate and former Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed Baradei, said the draft constitution was "a wasteland of history".
Through the short news service, Twitter accused supporters of Morsi of wanting to carry out a "coup against democracy".
"If he calls a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said Yasser Said, a member of the opposition.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet punished,” Khalid Ali, an Egyptian opposition politician, said in a statement.
Several judges have announced that they do not want to supervise the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Quran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood declared a demonstration, but out of caution not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by many veiled women and Salafist supporters who cried out: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They called out to Morsi, “Clear the earth!” and assured him, “The Koran is our constitution.”
The struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would probably trigger a civil war-like situation.
Clearly, Morsi's followers didn't want to risk it.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and distinctly.
Now is the time to let the people at the ballot box decide which direction the country should take.
The majority in favor of the Islamist proposal is considered certain.
"The word 'human rights' does not appear once"
The forced constitutional dispute, which should actually continue until February and integrate all social forces, Hafiz Abu Sa'da says.
The 48-year-old human rights defender and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended members of the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in jail or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their ideology, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now in the new constitution, the words 'human rights' are not even once," he complained in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state forced this lawyer to resign.
These measures are a scandalous offense against the democratic rules of the game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of the president strengthening civil society, he’s actually abolishing it,” Sa’da complains.
But without civil society organizations, democracy cannot work.
Sa'da also feels abandoned by the international community, which is watching the struggle of ideological factions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could get back at him.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You have created a monster that you can no longer control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the world's most sniffing fish?
Five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards not only in Europe but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to a local appetite for extra-smelling fish?
Take a few overripe cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a pile of dirty and wet football gear.
Leave it for a week.
So you get the smell of the paralyzing smell of rakfisku, one of Norway's biggest delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow, a magnificent view - and there is an ubiquitous smell in the air.
Rakfisk is a salted trout fermented in water for up to a year - it depends on how much you want the fish to smell.
As it gets dark and cold, Norwegians here in Fagernes begin to gather for a festival dedicated to this, how to say it best, most captivating meal.
“You eat it raw and then drink it with a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a local professional firefighter, but also the so-called Rakfisk General, who is responsible for the festival.
All around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink them with a lot of alcohol.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” says Havard.
The drink can overwhelm the smell.
I'll try a few pieces.
If the fish can avoid your nose, it's not so bad - it's similar to a piece of sushi that was on a long bus trip.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different time when there was poverty in Norway, and because there were no refrigerators yet, the fish soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in the autumn.
Then, in the middle of winter, when they were well fermented, they stretched out and ate - the senses no doubt blunted with alcohol.
Just one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to look for work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants attracted by large amounts of work, high earnings and an extensive care system.
The people of Sweden, an old rival that was even richer than Norway, are rushing into the country for work.
The rakfisk is seen as something important, indispensable, though a fairly fragrant part of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive foods on the market.
Although expensive is everything - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you 9 pounds ($ 14) per piece.
Norway often does not get into the global news - and it seems to suit the majority of the population.
The name of Anders Breivik, a right-wing racist extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year, is still mentioned here with disgust.
Instead, the shooting is called the “July 22 event.”
The Norwegians can hardly believe that in their peaceful country one of them was capable of such brutality and murder.
Behind Norway’s current wealth lies the growth of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says our waitress Anna, who, with her long blonde hair and surprisingly blue eyes, is a prototype for Nordic well-being.
We are, as they say, thoughtful people.
Her English, like the English of most of the people here, is absolutely perfect.
We don't pretend, we don't like showy.
Norway is handling its oil wealth very carefully - in addition to a small percentage, most of the money from this sector is invested in a special fund intended for future generations.
When everyone else in the years leading up to the global financial crash was throwing away money they didn’t have, the Norwegians had their strings tightly tightened on their purse.
“As long as we can ski in the winter and go on trips in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for something to eat - I've had enough of rakfisk.
Such a salmon burger is definitely something else and is beautifully juicy.
But tonight the stinking fish is here again.
The hotel where I live is one of the many places where the rakfisk is served for dinner and where guests choose the best, or rather for the smell of the most demanding fish.
They're connected to a live television broadcast in which a butterfly moderator is surrounded by a plate with a rakfisk.
It's like a Eurovision song contest.
"What's your score for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our scoring, Howard."
There is applause and laughter.
A man falls from a chair, perhaps powered by aquavit.
Or maybe the fumes from all the fish.
Enrique Pena Nieto from Mexico has a hard start
As Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC looks at the challenges he faces and the mixed expectations of his fellow citizens.
Transportation in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In the city, which is clogged even in the best of times, steel barriers were erected closing several key routes to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent commuters from getting to work, but to prevent protesters from accessing parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the President’s Sherpa and take over the leadership of the nation.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico was doing well economically during the presidency of outgoing Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed an estimated 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” President Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before shaking hands with the U.S. president, President Pena Nieto gained political experience as governor of his home state of Mexico.
The views of the new leader are also different in his old homeland, the populous and vast state surrounding the capital.
A straight man.
For example, in the rural town of Valle del Bravo, it is remembered for good.
Citizens attribute it to the development of tourism in the resort and the construction of infrastructure.
You can now drive to the city on one of the new highways that Pena Nieto has built. These highways are a huge improvement over the cracked and bumpy roads that used to be here.
Plates with his name also hang on the wall of a modern sports center and an impressive interactive museum with the theme of climate change.
“We expect it to bring real and lasting change,” said Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a friend and political ally of the state’s deputy for President Pena Nieto’s Party of the Institutionalized Revolution (PRI).
We particularly hope for the interesting and real changes in security and the economy that our country so urgently needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI party was ousted by Vicente Fox.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the Los Pinos presidential palace, much is expected of Enrique Pena Nieto inside the party.
And it rejects the expression of opposition characterizing the new president as a person with no substantive content.
He is a very straightforward man, very biased with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a great statesman, and most of all, he's a man who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, this is not the impression many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo cannot be more apparent.
Tucked under highway overpasses in many ways resembles the suburbs of the capital of Mexico.
And the problems in the self-governing municipality are also persistent and urban.
Earlier this year, an army was called in to help handle drug gangs operating in neighborhoods, especially the violence against women.
In the last two years alone, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped in deserted places next to a huge waste dump.
By the time Pena Nieto was governor, more than 1,000 women had been murdered in the state of Mexico, far more than in the notorious violent city of Ciudad Juarez – a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
At best, critics of Pena Nieta say that during his tenure in office, he failed to adequately address the issue of women’s murder.
And in the worst case, his leadership is accused of closing their eyes.
In a concrete house typical of a run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna and suppresses crying.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at her house, it was as if her body had been washed," Ms. Buendia recalls.
There were signs of blows on it, and postmortem stiffness had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, Mariana looks down from the picture on the wall, next to the cross, with only one word on it: “Justice.”
However, this, as the family says, is exactly what they were denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old gossip, troublemaker, and whiner.
They want you to just accept what they say and shut up.
"But it can't be right when there are so many mistakes and omissions," he says.
The sherpa, which President Pena Nieto will receive on Saturday, is accompanied by great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crime in Mexico over the past six years, and the new president has vowed to prioritize them as long as he remains in office.
"I hope he will be the same president as he was governor," Olvera, a PRI MP, said in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about mistreatment, military prosecutor says
The military prosecutor is trying to refute Bradley Manning's allegations of ill-treatment in custody.
The hearing focuses on Manning's stay in military custody in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on grounds of ill-treatment of Manning in prison.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of secret documents.
The military prosecutor is trying to prove that Private Bradley Manning, who is accused of the largest leak of secret material in U.S. history, missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
Ashden Fein, during a cross-examination of Private Manning at a preliminary hearing in Ft. Maede, Maryland, claimed that the records of weekly visits that Manning had with unit officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination, which took place during the defence hearing to dismiss the case against Manning on grounds of ill-treatment at the time of the detention, which in itself is a sufficient punishment, took place a day after Manning testified that he was contemplating suicide in custody.
An army intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published online on WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of her information.
At Friday's hearing, military prosecutor Fein, along with Manning, passed the forms the officers filled out after meeting Manning at the Quantico detention facility, where he was held under a high-security regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked him about these forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and rated the overall treatment at the facility as "very professional".
The forms do not show any complaints about mistreatment, even though Manning’s officers directly asked how he was treated, Fein argued.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns about the various problems orally, and that the officers who had visited him had spoken to him about those concerns and indicated that they would be addressed, but had not noticed them.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't mention them," Manning said.
Judge Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in January 2011 at a meeting with a committee assessing suicidal thoughts he had expressed on the form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during this meeting his intention was to achieve a reduction in the “injury prevention” regime.
The army said it used this restrictive regime (one degree under suicidal surveillance) for its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the guards in custody to know that I was fine and that I wanted to abolish this injury prevention regime... so that I could enjoy the increased quality of life I saw,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transported to a detention facility at a Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was contemplating suicide in Kuwait and fainted one day because of the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what would happen to him and what was happening in the world around him was very depressing.
"My world has shrunk only to the Arifjan base, to the cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I'd die in that cage.
Manning said he spent most of his days (at least 21 hours, but often more than 23 hours) in a small cell without any company after arriving in Quantico.
Manning said he was only allowed one mattress, a blanket, napkins, some clothes and glasses.
He said he tried to walk because sleeping or just lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning said he always slept with the light from the outside of the cell in his eyes.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned to the other side at night, they woke him up and had to turn back.
Manning's attorney filed a formal complaint about the treatment of Private Manning in January 2011.
Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, Judge Manning was also asked about the charges he made in Thursday’s testimony that, after being forced to sleep one night in his cell in Quantico naked, he was also forced to stand naked in front of guards and other fellow inmates during the morning count.
Manning said he was not allowed to cover himself with his blanket when he counted.
During Friday's interrogation, Judge Manning said that on the orders of his guards, he thought he had a blanket to cover, but admitted that no one had given him an order to defer her.
On Thursday, Manning said he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because he had tried to show the officer that he was not dangerous.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a belt from his underwear or his nasopharynx to hurt himself, but he didn’t.
Manning said that his underwear, goggles and goggles had been removed from his cell that night.
His lawyer hopes that the judge will take into account his experience during his imprisonment and that if he is convicted before a military court, which is expected to begin early next year, his sentence will be significantly reduced.
The defense said it planned that Manning would plead guilty to lower crimes and would fight other charges because they were too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to begin this week, and the military prosecutor is expected to defend the detention conditions as justified.
The Pentagon said in a statement that Manning had been held in accordance with the rules on all detainees held in maximum security custody.
The charges against Manning include aiding the enemy, unlawfully causing the publication of intelligence documents on the Internet, the transmission of information related to national security, and the theft of public property or records.
If convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to life.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many people have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of options there.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind them of difficult times, he says.
Navarrette says that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On my last trip to the capital of Mexico, I barely made it through the crowds and arrived at the immigration agenda area, where I encountered a problem.
The arrows pointed to one of two fronts: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds and didn’t know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and all my life I've been called "Mexican."
It's an ethnic abbreviation, just like when my friends in Boston call themselves "Iry" and my friends in New York call themselves "Italy."
So later I ended up being labeled "Mexican American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need to use abbreviations.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle both sides of the conversation in this language.
However, I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker and I do not know how to get rid of the American accent.
So I pulled out my American passport and queued up for the Extranjeros.
I was thinking about the moment when this week newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama in the White House.
They had the usual issues on the agenda, which are discussed when the leaders of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans are as likely to stay in Mexico as they are to travel to the United States.
He wants to merge with the United States and Canada to create a trade bloc similar to the European Union in North America.
And Pena Nieto promised to continue the Mexican war against drug cartels, even though he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of hostile feelings.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leader under threat of arms to relocate half of Mexican territory to the United States.
But for Mexicans who think in the span of centuries, not minutes, the comments are ubiquitous.
So the minute a U.S. official says something a little bit critical about Mexico, you're going to hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the elite about how Americans are interfering with their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma will set out on the warpath.
And yet for Mexico, the real challenge is the relationship to the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about hostile feelings?
There's a lot of them.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who are offered opportunities by the country, and others who are not.
The only reason so many people with Mexican roots live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is because at some point in our family tree there was a person, perhaps a parent or grandparents, who was denied the opportunity in Mexico and had to go north.
And more often than it would seem, this person corresponded to the profile - dark skin, poor education, origin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we are living the American Dream now, going to good schools and having a good job, we can never forget that we are living the American Dream, not the Mexican Dream.
Our identity may sometimes be unclear, but our loyalty is not.
It's against the United States.
And besides, we are aware that many of the elite Mexicans in the ruling class do not like us.
This feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeat, and they see us as a inferior race that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
Our existence, in their opinion, is only about failure.
If our families in Mexico hadn't failed, they would never have left.
And we would not now find ourselves trapped behind a silk curtain, with a good life in the United States, but still with lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally arrived in the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans understand more about who they are, and Mexican Americans dislike it.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she sees herself as part of two countries.
And at the same time, many Mexican Americans I know don't feel like part of one.
We love listening to Mexican bands, Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You get the best of both countries, but you have no roots in either.
In Mexico, he sees us as Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And to make things even more complicated, some Mexican leaders and some intelligence, as I learned during my trip, want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to work for Mexico as “provisional ambassadors” and represent Mexican interests in the United States.
We should tell our American fellow citizens how great it is to visit this country, and pressure political leaders to consolidate relations with Mexico.
Nope.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Too many hostile feelings.
And thanks to income inequality and widespread corruption and drug violence, many of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I feel like it's up to you, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for what it did with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept the fact that some Mexican Americans still feel dislike for the way in which their family members have been treated in a much closer past.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
Ending the fire between Israel and Hamas could still be a precarious foundation for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed suggests that any such event is futile.
Among the usual unnecessary guesses about who started it, many buildings were turned into rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, mostly civilians, and six Israelis were killed. And for the first time rockets from Gaza near Tel Aviv, the Israeli capital, and near the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their long-standing conflict, the Middle East is changing all around them.
The Arab Spring has changed the old order and Palestinians and Israelis, whether they like it or not, are caught up in the resulting chaos in the region.
Maybe this will make their fight more bloody than ever.
However, there are reasons to think that this can interrupt their deadly stalemate.
A war that is neither won nor lost.
At first glance, there seems to be little reason for optimism at the moment.
Even if the November 21 cease-fire lasted, this week’s fighting has strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to retreat, even as Gaza suffered a defeat.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the closure of 1.7 million Gazans in one of the world’s saddest and most populous corners, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining influence in the West Bank, another piece of Palestine that is currently controlled by its entrenched Fatah rivals, the more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders can very well conclude that time is on their side.
Islamists around the Arab world gained more influence, so Hamas gained powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurrected regional power that was once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined the Hamas side, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic countries in the Gulf.
The cheering people of Hamas say the Islamic crescent is circling Israel, north of Lebanon, where Hezbollah’s party/military is ruling, across Syria, where rebels who are increasingly prone to Islamism can depose Bashar al-Assad, all the way to Jordan, where Hamas’ allies are threatening the king.
And above all, on Israel’s southern wing, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and pivotal Arab country, has changed the balance in the region.
Hosni Mubarak, a secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have time for Hamas.
On the contrary, the Brotherhood is the cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more influenced by public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as a player that cannot be ruled out by either Israel or the United States.
On the contrary, Israeli hardliners will come to the opposite conclusion.
In military terminology, Hamas was put back in the box.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system proved its worth, and many of Hamas’s missiles were destroyed.
Israelis can sleep better - for a while.
In diplomatic terminology, America is as steadfast as ever, and many European countries have also blamed Hamas for launching the last round of violence.
And most importantly, Israel prospered, especially under the leadership of Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister, who largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been relatively quiet from suicide bombers, in part thanks to a wall that encroaches on the West Bank, the main part of what may one day be a Palestinian state, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite their illegality under international law.
Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more radical group led by Avigdor Lieberman at the start of the January 22nd election campaign, is in a good position.
Why spoil these treacherous Palestinians by giving them their own state?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they be firing rockets, as their compatriots in Gaza did?
It's better if we keep them behind that wall and beat them when they stick their heads out.
Hardliners may win, but the Arab Spring can change their calculations.
While the Islamists, who are gaining power in Egypt and other countries, do not love Israel very much, their top priority will be dealing with domestic problems.
Israel’s defense spending is higher than that of all four of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a new war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to heal their economy.
The fact that President Morsi has worked with President Barack Obama to achieve a cease-fire is a good sign and could mark the beginning of something new.
Israelis should also look at the situation from a long-term perspective.
At a time when the rest of the Arab world is becoming more democratic, denying Palestinians the right to self-determination a barrel of gunpowder that must one day explode in Israeli-occupied areas — just like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv last week.
Already today, repression is weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this situation as the Arab population grows.
The bloody attacks against Gaza, which take place every few years in order to push Hamas, will increasingly levy a diplomatic tax.
Both sides need incentives from the outside.
The answer is what reasonable people on both sides, most of the outside world, and these newspapers proclaim: two states where Israel will cede territory for security reasons.
In the short term, there is little hope that stopping the fire will give pressure from outside at least a little more impact on the enforcement of this matter.
Egypt, which, together with Turkey and Qatar, must push for a halt to arms deliveries to Gaza, is in a better position than ever to persuade Hamas to embrace the idea of a 1967 border-based Jewish state with a part-country exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside must also push for a consensus between Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more than an immediate offer of virtual state sovereignty in the United Nations to create a Palestinian state.
President Obama also has a role to play in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
In his first term, he neglected to present his own peace plan.
Now, back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant in his entry into the process.
That's patheticly short-sighted.
America has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This means a peaceful settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia's Ugly Cigarette Packaging Laws Enter into Force
The unsightly green boxes, which are the same for all brands of tobacco, depict warnings for smokers and sick parts of the body.
Australia’s Ugly Tobacco and Cigarette Packaging Act, the world’s first, came into force and replaced the brand’s logos and colors with generic olive-green boxes with disgusting images of sick body parts and images of children and newborns sick from smoking by their parents.
In addition to various health warnings and images, the only difference between the boxes of brand names that are printed in the same small print is mandatory from Saturday.
This is the strictest regime in the world regarding tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to discourage young people from smoking by stripping the habit of its appeal.
It relies on studies that show that if people don’t start smoking by age 26, there’s a 99% chance they’ll never start smoking.
“Even in very young children, you can see that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to sell them along with their product,” says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have shown, for example, that children associate a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess.
While Australia has one of the lowest numbers of smokers in the world and the changes will have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering similar steps.
The tobacco industry has lobbied hard against the introduction of these laws.
Tobacco companies have argued that the law will increase black market trade, leading to cheaper and more affordable cigarettes.
“This legislation will lead to serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will import much more of these products, which will be sold on Australian streets.
Others claim that the laws have increased their trades.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that demand for silicone cigarette packaging used to cover disgusting boxes, two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco companies increased their sales of the highest-ranking legal appeal to the Australian court.
Ha said that Zico has sold nearly 6,000 units to wholesalers and expects new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
As a possible hindrance, experts state the popularity of social media in the demographic group that the plan targets.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising, sponsoring sporting events, and requiring most retailers to hide cigarettes from a direct view, tobacco marketing has moved online.
Australia has banned online advertising by local companies and websites, but cannot restrict foreign sites.
“If you’re a marketing worker in the tobacco industry and you only have this little space left to promote your products, the online space is the unmatched place you want to be,” says Becky Freeman, a researcher in public health at the University of Sydney.
Mrs. Freeman has seen an increase in brand ratings on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, carried out by "average Honza".
We have to ask, is it just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and gave himself a job and created this video, or is there a marketing company involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry has focused on how it handles new regulations rather than marketing.
The industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic for attacking new regulations – countries within the World Trade Organization claim that trade is unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of the countries does not significantly trade with Australia.
The decision of the SOO is expected in mid-2013.
Minister Plibersek says the government has held talks with other governments that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to introduce mandatory warning photographs in 2001.
They have now spread to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India are considering stricter laws.
There are a lot of smokers in Australia.
The pictures have no effect on me.
I just ignore them.
"Just pull out a cigarette and push the box back," says Victor El Hage when buying a box with a photo of the tumor in his mouth.
Honestly, there’s only one reason for me to quit smoking, and that’s my little girl.
James Yu, who owns the King of the Pack store in downtown Sydney, says it’s harder for him to stack the boxes.
"It took me an hour to unload the cargo, now it takes me four hours," Yu said.
“The government should simply ban them completely, then we’d say, ‘OK, that’s it, we’ll close the shop,’” he said, shaking his hands.
In the world of constant connection, it's not so bad to be bored
On the last Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for the next plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Waiting half a day at the airport for the next flight is pretty annoying, despite the distraction of books, magazines and iPhones (not to mention duty-free shops).
But some scientists and experts on child development are increasingly coming up with praise for boredom.
They say that it is good for us (and our children) to get bored sometimes.
It forces the brain to go in interesting directions, which can encourage creativity.
And since most of us are constantly connected to a screen these days, we have no chance to enjoy boredom.
Should we encourage boredom?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, no.
But I'll get back to that.
First of all, like many people, I assumed that boredom is a relatively new phenomenon, which occurred with the advent of more free time.
But as Peter Toohey, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, says, he is the author of Boredom: A Lively History (Yale University Press, 2011).
"In fact, boredom has a long history," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii was found a Latin inscription about boredom, dating from the first century AD.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and discussed in many different ways, said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After looking at the research literature and presenting the idea to the target group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience "I wanted to do something that would satisfy me, but I was not able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy in that a person is not involved in anything, but would like to be.
He says there's no compulsion to do anything about apathy.
He says that the core of boredom is "the disruption of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and a feeling of slow passing time."
Boredom can be a lot like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while they can have a relationship with each other, bored people tend to see the problem as the environment or the world, while people who are depressed see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when we’re just having trouble concentrating.
In their study, The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading an article from the journal.
Some groups heard the loud, unrelated television program in the next room, others heard it so quietly that they barely noticed it, while the third group did not hear it at all.
Those who heard the TV program silently reported more boredom than the other two groups — they had trouble concentrating, but they weren’t sure why, and attributed those troubles to boredom.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, distraction can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, “like finding the wrong parts on the factory line, distracting music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he said, we now know that twisting and frowning, often seen as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight boredom and keep people physically alert.
“The research shows that children who are allowed to spin will learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still,” Fenske said.
We've all experienced boredom at times - the delay of my flight, the buzzing speaker, a particularly lengthy film.
Some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure boredom, scientists in the 1980s developed the Boredom Proneness Scale.
The scale includes questions such as: “Many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous,” and “I have so many interests that I don’t have time to do them all.”
Using these scales, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially when it comes to the need to have more and different external stimuli.
However, teenagers are generally insecure.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored at school and doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
Three percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the percentage of boredom would be now, 21 years later, higher or lower.
But he said he knows that “teenage is the peak time for boredom”, which is largely due to the fact that children and young people are not given much control over what they want to do.
So back to my original question: "Is boredom good for you?".
As research shows, sometimes not, because in its extreme form it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, play gambling or abuse addictive substances as a way to mitigate it.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have debated the connection between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
"Luck is a way of the brain to tell you that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at NYU.
But the brain doesn’t always know the best thing you should do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
However, if you watch TV, it will make you happy only for a while, not for a long time.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t get bored anymore, but he won’t learn how to have fun on his own or drive on his own, Professor Fenske said.
And "this separate procedure is transferred from one situation to another," the professor said.
Your child will not only learn how to entertain himself, but will gain more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we really want to celebrate boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of her either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable when we are out of reach of the constant grinding of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agreed.
"We accuse her of having to be bored even more, but boredom is a painful, restless desire to be associated with something meaningful," he said.
What people are really looking for, he said, is a way to relax and enjoy your free time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly re-stimulated,” he said, “it’s hard to find ways to have fun when the noise goes off.”
There is no guide to the new marijuana law in Colorado
Nineteen-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and footballer from southeastern Colorado, faces criminal charges for something that will soon be legal across the state – for holding a few grams of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke her.
Mr. Orozco said that one September day he rode with a few friends in Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when he was stopped.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco was given a subpoena for possession of drugs and equipment for drug use - minor offenses for which there is a $100 fine - and he was set a court date.
'They treated us like criminals, 'said Mr. Orozco.
But he's a criminal?
In the uncertain weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize a small amount of marijuana for recreational use, the response of hundreds of smaller drug cases depends on the site rather than the law.
Hundreds of marijuana possession offences have already been dropped here and in the state of Washington, which has approved similar measures.
The police department has stopped blaming adults aged 21 and older for holding a small amount that will be legally allowed after the law enters into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in more conservative Colorado counties have said they will continue with existing marijuana cases, and still accuse people of possession.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver toward the western mountains are voting to prevent new state-licensed marijuana stores from opening in their municipalities.
"This thing is moving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, a police chief in the city of Aurora, east of Denver.
Even the regulators in Washington state are talking their heads off.
And they are looking for instructions on how to set up a license system for growing, producing, distributing and selling - all by December 1, 2013.
They say Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, first for medical use and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Licensing Board.
But as Mr. Smith admitted, no place or system can do more than suggest what might work.
“There is no real precedent to follow,” he said.
The Washington Act, called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, which also leaves an annual vacuum during which there will be no state licensing system yet, but legal holding does.
And there are heated mechanical issues that need to be addressed during this time, such as how to balance a state directive on “adequate access” to licensed marijuana with its ban on cannabis trade within 330 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to place a licensed cannabis store than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently established research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates of the city of Aurora sent an email to his officers informing them that the city prosecutor would no longer prosecute offenses for possession of a small amount of marijuana in every citizen over 21 and that the police would "immediately" stop blaming people for these crimes.
Chief Oates said police would enforce city laws regulating medical marijuana growers and would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mostly as a way to pressure users to seek treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many face further charges.
“Our office is obliged to prosecute criminal offences that were criminal offences at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was also complicated in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer accuse adults of holding small amounts.
The district attorney, Pete Hautzinger, supports this decision, but has also decided not to reject all ongoing cases of possession.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, bringing recreational marijuana into the hands of the government and the legal system will never be easy.
And conflicting reactions across the state have revealed deep divisions among local officials in view of this large state green experiment.
For district attorneys, this is a “cultural barrier,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver-based lawyer representing marijuana defendants, and a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still can't really accept that it's legal," he said.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are on track to become the nation’s testing cases for drug legalization.
Lawyers and state authorities are planning new boundaries for legalized sales, while also anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hoping the Justice Department will yield.
Despite several arrests of medical marijuana vendors and patients who used it, which attracted attention, most of the federal government left medical marijuana stores in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states in operation.
While anti-drug agents are unlikely to kick in the door to catch a small bag of drugs, they are likely to resist allowing state-regulated recreational marijuana stores allowed under the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former adviser on the Obama administration’s anti-drug policy.
Several Colorado cities are not waiting for federal action.
Even before election day, some local governments have approved moratoriums on any new marijuana stores, even though it will take about a year for any store to open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose proposed a six-month ban and is likely to enter into force next week.
“We don’t want to be in a situation where we give someone a license and then we’re going to have a big federal issue,” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are looking at what the community voted for, as opposed to what the state voted for.
There's really a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was forced to leave Oxford because I'm a conservative."
It is not only today’s university students who are being challenged for their views.
I don't remember ever dreaming of studying at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother studied at a university that I thought was the world’s largest seat of knowledge, a modern-day betrothed Greek symposium motivating the two pillars of civilization, free thinking and tolerance.
And so far, in the late 1980s, within two weeks of joining Worcester College, where I wanted to study history, I packed my suitcases and rushed into the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
Evening Standard claimed that I gave up because I objected to loving students in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson casually declared that I had left because I was forced to drink from beaten cups.
The truth was less comical.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was subjected to systematic bullying and intimidation.
Not because of my rather bizarre name or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one reason, and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigotry and barbarism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a high-ranking adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
You may be wondering why I'm pulling it out now.
Simply because recent reports suggest that a new generation of students to the right of the center suffers from similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative students in Oxford is so great that last week a group of these students demanded the same protection of equal rights as gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR at Corpus Christi College say that because of their political views, they are “often actively isolated, exposed to personal attacks, and are being shown that they are not welcome.”
They call for the creation of a position on the University Equal Opportunity Committee to ensure that their views can be freely communicated.
The BBC Two documentary Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right about student political events, which he described as queer and neo-Nazis, did not help their situation.
The show featured graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who rode a Rolls-Royce, was dressed in a silver suit and wore a stick with a silver head.
At other colleges, conservative students say they are treated as “sacrifice lambs” because of the introduction of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, the 20-year-old vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told Sunday’s newspaper that “leftist influence in universities is growing.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever meeting with us."
A 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi, Samuel Roberts, who is behind the movement for greater protection, says such a climate is “unpleasant,” while OUCA’s nineteen-year-old elected president, Stephanie Cherill, says there has been a deterioration in JCR members’ approach to people to the right of the center.
"This poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
During my first few weeks in Oxford, I was a minority of one member.
I joined in September 1986, 18 years old and in a crippling way shy.
Hatred against the Conservative Party was the most bitter.
A year earlier, the university had voted to reject the honorary degree of former student Margaret Thatcher because of cuts in funding for higher education.
Even Stalinists would be shaken by the atmosphere.
During the first few days of the opening week, when the new students meet with each other and with the professors, I was given a taste of the wormwood that was to come.
I found out that not only do professors quietly approve of bullying conservative pupils, but they also enjoy participating in it.
A policy of mining strikes, privatization and government resistance to apartheid sanctions in South Africa was brought to the wood-clad auditoriums.
My first lecture dealt with the translation of the French text from the 18th century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I was getting pretty stiff.
Professor Pitt, a little man with a cake-dough face, was very gall-like.
"The Thatchers refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students giggled.
There were tears in my eyes.
"I suggest you take some basic French lessons in your spare time, unless you're too busy with social matters," Pitt grunted.
I was crushed back to my room.
At dinner at school, I was sitting alone when I felt a slight tapping on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, that's true.
Anyone suspected of conservatism is a target.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be worse for you.
Most conservative first-graders pretend to be Labour.
Later in the local pub, I tried to pretend cowardly.
I insisted that I disagree with everything Thatcher said.
This trick proved to be unsuccessful.
A first-year student in philosophy, politics, and economics, who (ironically) went to Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're infected.
The other students were recording with him.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do conservatives love each other?" one asked.
They're beating each other, right?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Can I ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Would I have to change into a laborer and suppress my natural inclinations?
Three years before me have developed as a purgatory of ignorance and isolation.
The only openly conservative professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history who was based at my faculty.
He was hated not only for being conservative, but also for being Margaret Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of those who wrote her speeches.
He almost wasn't there.
He hated the place for its provincialism and pettyness and for its inclination to a Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he became a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting from Oxford to my parents’ house in London, seeking refuge with my unbiased metropolitan friends and family.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He couldn't believe it.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political opinions were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in a dream town.
Even my communist friends have always had perfect ways.
His wet eyes grieved.
Try it again.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by frequent trips to London, my emotional resilience deteriorated.
My friend, also a supporter of the Conservative Party, succumbed to pressure and renounced his conviction.
The following week, in the course of teaching, when another professor of history had declared in absolute seriousness that I was an "enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Even though I was blushing inside, I confessed that my parents brainwashed me and called them “old fools.”
The relief was only short-lived.
My father stabbed a nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At that time, he wrote two columns a week to Murdoch's newspaper.
My door was locked.
I shrugged inside, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and caught the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a snotty weakling.
But no 18-year-old girl or boy should be subject to such intimidation and poisoning in an educational institution.
Even more tragic is that it was Oxford, from which not only 14 conservative prime ministers emerged, but which still hides behind the undeserved reputation of a place with equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which began this week in London, ABC spoke with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz and other famous customers of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the ancient residence of Isabella I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
The designer confirmed this at the launch of the celebrated retrospective "Valentino: Master of Fashion Creation", which presents more than 130 top fashion models created by his studio over the past 50 years.
"I love this castle," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story in which "il signore" Garavani is the only protagonist who could not have been written without his revered clients.
Valentino always felt enchanted by the rare and distant world of the aristocracy.
The first hall of the exhibition, which runs until March 3rd, is filled with private correspondence and photographs with signatures of the most important nobles, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to the Greek Princess Marie-Chantal and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a simple tailor from the town of Voghera in northern Italy to an idol of the international "Bohemian cream".
Loving the royal family is not a bad thing.
“At least they don’t stick a cigarette in a great carpet like some of the great pop-music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisz.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an impressive host and entertains guests abounding and with elegance.
"We were all very pleased to be invited to his Gstaad cottage," explains "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife and close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
"Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
He's still a star."
Valeria Mazzov<0xC3><0xA1> performs Valentina
The charism of the designer is not forgotten by the Argentinian model Valeria Mazzov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It's been many years since we went to dinner with him after one show at Piazza di Spagna in Rome.
There were twenty of us, and Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr., were among us.
In every detail of his apartment, decoration, food, music, in everything he was reflected and his spirit was felt.
He made everyone feel important and loved,” recalls the top model who started working with him during Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art,” he concludes.
The Nobility Show
Gravani's life is not a story of obsession, but of truly reciprocated love.
He loves people with good upbringing and better titles and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House was rebuilt into a distinctive seventy-metre long arcade, which offers an exchange of roles: the visitor turns into a model and marches through the arcade to observe the "community" of dreams that Valentine's masterpieces wear like the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Mossis Onassis.
In the audience of the models shine names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is the first love, "you can't forget it".
"I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, "gillette" vest and jacket from the autumn-winter collection from 1971-1972.
It was a gift he made for me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
"I give him priority over others for his femininity and great love for women because it underlines our beauty," the former Duchess of Feria said.
"I really like the colors he uses, they brighten up a lot and give a sparkle to his face.
The proportions are perfect.”
Even the princess and fashion icon Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget how she first dressed Valentina.
When she was growing up and living in Italy, she wanted to be an adult and have the opportunity to wear one of his evening dresses.
It eventually came to the end of the 1990s.
"I bought my first dress from Valentino to celebrate at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress that had a skirt with a bell, a girdle, and a shoulderless top.
It was a dream that became a reality," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
“Valentino is lax in fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains an Italian aristocrat whose life takes place between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg has kept the designer's festive dress "very carefully... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories that they have in them."
"King" of fashion
The golden highlight of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller from her wedding to Paul the Greek in 1995.
To create these silk dresses of ivory color with sewn pearls, twelve types of different lace and a four and a half meter long tow, it took four months of work and 25 "towels" (as the designer calls his seamstresses).
According to journalist Suza Menkes, the largest authority of the specialized press, these dresses represent a milestone of the top fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of clients from high society".
Valentino, dazzled by the elitist "savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre" over the years, is now his best example.
Garavani as Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest honour in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and decorated with the Order of the Legion of Honour, amass as much honor as any of the husbands of his clients.
"My attention has always been drawn to his choice, calm, well-groomed and perfect appearance," Princess d'Arenberg said.
"The last time I saw him was a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum a month ago.
He was at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, my great friend.
It was perfect, time left no trace of it."
When the princess says it...
The hardest craft in the world: sulphur carriers in the Kawah Ijen volcano area
For four euros, carriers in the Indonesian volcano area gamble with their lives and health as they carry 70 kilos of sulfur down steep stone paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and there are those who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Ant Wijayi, one of the 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Because of this, it has to fly every day to the bottom of the crater, where sulphur gases escape from the interior of the Earth and pass into a solid state when in contact with air.
After cutting out large blocks of sulfur, which together weigh up to 70 kilograms, he carries them on his shoulders in two bamboo baskets along steep stone paths.
To the summit of the volcano, which rises 2,386 meters, it is only 250 meters, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to rise at a turtle's pace, as they maintain balance and carefully consider their steps so that they do not slip and fall into the abyss.
They know that any stumbling block could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who collapsed from the rocks of Kawah Ijen years ago.
Miners in Kawah Ijen earn five cents for every kilo of sulfur they mine
When they’re upstairs, they make their way around tourists photographing them as if they were monkeys in a circus, and tiredly carry heavy baskets to a scale that the mining company has placed just below, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is a company PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been mining in the volcano since 1960 and has never paid its workers more than 662 Indonesian rupees (five cents) per kilo of sulfur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral has its place in everyday life and is used for making matches, fun pyrotechnics, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Because we normally carry 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each trip,” explains Anto, who usually goes three trips a day.
One trip takes him three hours and at the end he is destroyed, but he can earn 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) per day.
Although this seems like a negligible amount for such inhumane efforts, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"The daily wage of miners here is very high. For example, for collecting coffee, 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day and the salary for fourteen days is two million rupees (167 euros), "explains the carrier, who previously worked on the tourist island of Bali as a bricklayer.
There was his salary of 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) per day and the work was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a serious reason that is as convincing in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali who is Hindu, and I took her to Converva."
Anto has asthma, he's having trouble breathing, he's always coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto risks his life three times a day in the Kawah Ijen volcano, whose sulfur has already begun to levy its toll on him, despite his face being protected by a special mask and glasses.
He's got asthma, he's having a bad breath, he's still coughing, and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases that escape from the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to achieve your dream.
“I’m going to work for two more years because I want to open a business or study Spanish or French,” he said.
This sympathetic and intelligent young man haunted by fate could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, and instead do the work of a carrier.
She shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every day at two in the morning, because the sulfur does not cease to fade at night, and its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Despite the surrounding darkness, Anto flies into the crater and lights his way with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers carry sulphur baskets from the bottom of the crater on their shoulders
Although the company has high incomes, sulphur mining has not been mechanized, nor does it provide any equipment to carriers working on their own and with such effort.
In fact, they don’t even get a share of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) from the photography surcharge, which, along with a 15,000 rupee (1.2 euros) ticket, nature park guards collect from tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for cattle, not people,” Madrusin, a 42-year-old carrier who has been working at Kawah Ion for only three decades, has objected since he left school.
He can lift up to 110 kilos and assures us that he will last as long as he can, because he needs money to educate his three sons between the ages of 18 and 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and bites in the eyes, when the wind unexpectedly turns and catches the miners in the dense fumes that come out of the volcano, the miners are so claiming that none of them complains that they suffer from serious illnesses... but this is evident from their frequent respiratory problems, arthritis and pain of the shoulders.
Unainik, who balances his basket on his back, can only load 50 kilos at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his colleagues mine 15 tons of sulfur in the volcano, which is then transported by three trucks by a steep path between the thicket to a warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik says, opening his mouth wide and missing a few teeth.
Of his five sons, the eldest, a thirty-year-old, also earns by mining sulfur.
Time passes, but the continual misery of one of the world’s most difficult crafts persists from generation to generation – the crafts that execute human mules in Kawah Iljen.
Singapore is looking for a baby to save the economy
Singaporeans are seduced by the fact that they do not have children, to career, stress and the cost of living and education.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
I'm married and I'm a patriot, you're my wife and you're a patriot.
It may seem incredible that this slogan is part of a menthol candy ad, but yet — or perhaps that’s why — the video has massively spread to YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These sentences are part of a rap that uses local hints like "let's put a bun in the oven" as a mockery of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that created the video, hopes that they will be able to highlight the problem in a funny way with this ad.
The agency’s artistic director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the influence of music to make people fulfill their “civil duty.”
“It’s just a matter of the internet, so it must have been fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem of this country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our population, so we felt it was a topic we had to touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot of things like expand perfumes with pheromones or organize dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not fully functional.
So we thought, why not do the most creative thing possible, like rap composition, to solve this problem.”
1.2 children
The one who doesn’t take it lightly is the Singaporean government.
They spend $1,300 a year to encourage citizens to have more children.
The government’s marriage and family package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and allocates financial benefits.
All of these measures had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy city state with advanced technology in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore in terms of population distribution is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time the birth rate exceeded the value of 2, which is considered the recovery rate, was in 1976.
Why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the Marriage and Family Department of the National Population Office, says it’s because of “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“People have a wider range of options when it comes to life’s goals and priorities, it’s not just marriage and family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of single people and to the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
While there have been efforts within immigration policy to drastically increase the influx of immigrants as a measure against population decline, this has caused displeasure among local residents.
Some Singaporean websites show undisguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and making little effort to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s government party recorded its worst election result since independence last year.
After the elections, efforts were made to solve the problem through quotas and higher fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in birth rates has known impacts on national economic growth, tax revenues, health spending, and immigration policy, there have also been some unexpected consequences in the case of Singapore.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate trade.
The Office for Urban Development has begun to regulate the number of small apartments known as "boot boxes" that can be built in certain urban zones.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and had great success in sales.
However, there is concern that these apartments may promote a youthful lifestyle and discourage developers from building large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of EL Developers, says their “boot boxes” are selling much faster than larger houses.
“They’re more popular by selling them days to weeks faster than larger-area homes.
That’s why they’re so much better for our cash flow.”
However, he admits that the new standards set clearer rules for developers who were previously limited to offer too many small houses in one project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
Although the new rules could aim to increase the birth rate of the nation, an interview with Singaporeans working in the financial district in the city center suggests they won’t have much effect.
“People are still stressed, homes are expensive, as is education, which is why a lot of people put it off,” the young official says.
"Let the others have children.
But it is important for me to rely on my own money and time," says another, about 20-year-old, a young man.
Both men and women mention careers, stress, and the cost of living and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So no matter how much the government tries to force citizens to have children, it's the Singaporeans who have the final say on family building.
What is private offline is private and online
-Privacy.
According to a dictionary published by the Royal Spanish Academy, it is something of a personal nature or an “area of private life, which everyone has the right to protect against any interference”.
What is privacy for a person under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when he publishes things on the Internet that he would certainly not tell anyone during normal communication?
Journalists from elPeriodico interviewed five boys and girls between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequent Internet users.
In four cases, they considered the concept of privacy to be "something entirely personal" on a personal level and as a "user name and password" if it was a social network.
“I wouldn’t reveal my biggest secret,” says Jorge, a 10-year-old in an effort to explain the importance of privacy in places like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom may know about them, but not the whole world," he said.
"On FB, I put nice pictures or pictures of us playing.
I also talk to friends there.
I wouldn’t share a photo that wasn’t mine, or a photo that would make someone laugh,” she says.
This boy realizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, photographs of naked persons or photographs of crimes, or to write humiliating or rude comments.
Jorge says he knows all 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Among them is a mother who has the name and password of one of the accounts.
“I set up a Twitter account so I could express my opinions and write interesting posts.
I don’t know if anyone will answer me, I just put them there,” he adds.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to relatives who are far away or quickly communicate with friends,” she says.
Without hesitation, he says he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
He wouldn't even care if someone recommended a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
The teenager owns accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and admits to not knowing 20 people from his friend list.
"I'm not afraid of it because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to this boy, none of them were pointing him to anything, nor did they want his address or phone number.
“If they insist on me or ask me to do so, I will simply remove them from my account,” he said.
José signed up for Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
These boys are not strangers to experience what is now called cyberbullying.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
They threatened him and demanded money.
He never knew who it was," he said.
According to Jose, the victim did not log out of the account.
"You just activated the private regime."
Then, he explains a series of steps to set up the account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would publish photos of acquaintances in unpleasant or embarrassing situations.
"Of course I would do it if someone bothered me or just wanted to.
“I know it’s cyberbullying,” he said.
Key Issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a graduate of Education and Teaching, believes that in order for children and adolescents to be properly oriented on social networks, they need to understand that the main goal of these networks is to inform.
“The Internet was created as a means of searching for information, but when social networks appeared, the rules of the game changed.”
Marrielos Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a graduate of pedagogy at Yale University and the author of the article Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants, introduced these concepts to explain the phenomenon.
“Digital natives are children and young people who were born at the time of this technology.
We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, and yet we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex topic, "because we ask them to discern what is appropriate to disseminate, publish and say, and what is not, at an age when they are not yet ripe for it."
Also, to be - as far as the surroundings are concerned - prudent, at a time when what they most desire is to be popular, to have thousands of friends and not to think about the consequences."
According to this specialist, the most effective way to show children and adolescents what privacy is, is to ask questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do something doesn't work," he adds.
Marrielos Porras also lists some of the options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the Internet?
Or: Would you like someone to post your photo the way you posted your friend’s?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you identify the people in the photos from the celebrations, did you ask those people for permission?
And one more thing: Do they always need to know what you're doing?
Another point is to realize that they have to behave in the environment of the Internet as well as outside it.
They're the same rules.
“A person outside the Internet is guided by respect, morality and other principles, and the same should be done on social networks,” he says.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, first-degree teacher and educational advisor, explains that it is essential that parents of children read the rules of social networks carefully.
“If they understand every little trick, they have a good reason to talk to children about the consequences that setting up an account on the Internet can have.
For example, in terms of age or what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to the Guardian, it is crucial to remind children of the traditional rule of “don’t talk to strangers”.
South America Summit Ends and Lima Declaration Not Published
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Peru ended today without the Lima Declaration being issued, which was announced and allegedly signed by the seven presidents present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth meeting of the heads of state and government of the organization Unasur, but representatives of the State Department and the presidential office, who initially agreed to publish the document after the summit, said that it will be published later on the Peruvian government's website.
They also said the content was published by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala in several short press releases.
Journalists had limited access to information throughout the summit.
During the meeting, a video from the presidential assembly without sound was transmitted in the press room with the message "confidential meeting, audio transmission prevented".
A small amount of information available to journalists was provided by the press representatives of some governments that were present, but not by Peruvian speakers.
The only document published during the meeting was a list of participating presidents, which aroused the reluctance of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media outlets who asked for more information.
Later, the Peruvian presidential office sent an email to the media with a “final statement” from the summit, but it was only a statement by President Humala, not an official document that the summit concluded.
Last October, Peru hosted the third summit of the South American and Arab countries (América del Sur-Pa<0xC3><0xAD>ses <0xC3><0x81>rabes, ASPA) and even on this occasion, the originally promised Lima Declaration was not published, although it was eagerly demanded by the press.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be found that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure a broadcast for all journalists, but completely prevented the flow of information.
The summit ended, among other things, with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment by the Hague Court, which resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
Peruvian President Ollanta Humala and Chilean President Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era met during a regional meeting and confirmed that they would respect the decision of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which on Monday will begin hearing the defence speech of both sides to discuss the dispute that Lima has initiated against Santiago.
"We will comply and enforce a verdict that will resolve the dispute that we are hearing in this international court today," President Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, conventions and international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said.
The two presidents’ confirmation of their compliance with the International Court of Justice’s decision was released after Colombia adopted the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact this week, expressing their compliance with the judgments of the international court that ruled on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, and Colombia considered the decision to be utterly erroneous.
The summit was held without the participation of the presidents of Brazil (Dilma Rouseff), Venezuela (Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez), Bolivia (Evo Morales) and Argentina (Cristina Kirchner).
Paraguay was expelled from Unasur in 2011 after the impeachment of then-President Fernando Lugo and did not attend the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the morning speeches and concluding the Lima Summit shortly after noon.
The president read the final document, in which he informed that 16 agreements had been adopted and activities were planned on 31 projects between South American countries, with investments of $ 17 billion.
In addition to the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the UNASUR member states would take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which residency agreements are being expanded".
Actions are being promoted to improve “cooperation in the fight against civil insecurity and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines and affordable internet in all corners of South America, and to jointly and effectively address the risks of natural disasters.”
When Europe is in crisis, “economic consolidation [of Latin America] should not have a winning nature, but rather serve to increase our productivity and show our peoples a better future,” Humala added.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 symbolic projects that will improve the transport connections of various places in South America, especially rural and border areas... so that our countries are better connected and create new economic ties,” he said.
He mentioned that five of these projects relate to Peru and its transverse axis from the coast to Brazil, and the other two relate to a better connection with Ecuador, but did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to bring it back to the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
Another of the issues highlighted by the summit was the need for Latin America to remain a prosperous and peaceful area that is whole and has good neighbourly relations.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before attending a regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega in Mexico on Saturday to respectfully discuss the International Court of Justice ruling on the maritime border dispute, which is being challenged by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
“We will discuss all the solutions, none are excluded, nor the agreement with Nicaragua, which would require negotiations with this country,” he said.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we should conduct the negotiations in the most civilized and considerate way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet in Mexico on Saturday to attend the inauguration of President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta.
During the summit, EU defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Members of UNASUR are Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru is the interim president of this regional bloc.
Rafael Correa: South America must learn integration from Europe
Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa has said that “the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which South America, in this case, really, must learn from Europe.”
Correa, who attended the Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on state television that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but are now practically one country".
In this sense, the project advocated the creation of South American citizenship, which the Unasur member states support.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers within any South American country that is already taking place among the members of the Andean Community, but there are still areas of return that want to bring us back to the past," he said.
The Ecuadorian president said he agreed to a regrouping of the Organization of American States (OAS) on the condition that Anglo-Saxon states’ influence was reduced and those who signed the San José Covenant on Human Rights were taken into account.
"Those in the lead never commit to anything, and we South Americans will sign everything.
It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is funded in Washington by the United States,” Julian Assange said in a reference to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder.
President Correa confirmed that he did not regret the decision because it did not betray his principles, and respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He added that at the time, “there was a reasonable suspicion that Assange could be extradited to a third country regardless of the ongoing process.”
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary, which asked him to be questioned on Swedish territory for alleged sexual offences, with “own Swedish legislation allowing for a video conference call that could take place from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's physical and mental health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been on our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has minor lung problems, but nothing serious," the Ecuadorian head of state said.
"But his physical and mental condition is at risk of getting worse because he is confined to a small space without the possibility of moving in the fresh air.
This would affect everyone’s health,” he added.
President Correa noted that the resolution of the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on the basis of a permit that allows him to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, and stressed that talks were held with London to resolve the detention of the founder of WikiLeaks.
“We don’t negotiate on human rights, we don’t use that word in this case, but we’re constantly talking.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European courts, because Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n is leading a series of proceedings in various European instances,” he said.
He said: “If the UK issues a pass tomorrow, it’s all over.”
And if Sweden hears Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as allowed by the legislation there, and as has already been done in other cases, this problem will be solved tomorrow."
Correa took advantage of this situation to present himself as a defender of press freedom, and made it clear that he definitely does not tolerate “sub-averageness, bad intentions and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of the free press are not us, vile and perverse politicians, but bad journalists in the service of profit, coercion and blackmail,” he said.
From this point of view, he expressed satisfaction at the fact that neither such journalists, "neither bankers, nor hegemonic countries, nor bourgeoisie control Ecuador," and predicted that if re-elected, "it will continue to change in the right way and in the right direction."
Correa also backed the decision to keep Paraguay's veto of Unasur's membership at least until its next election, arguing that the whole "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état shrouded in legality" because in fact it "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
In addition, the Ecuadorian president said he considered "very appropriate" the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries now, at the time of the International Court of Justice's ruling in The Hague in favor of Nicaragua.
The verdict is currently not accepted.
"This is a problem between a South American and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They need to be assessed broadly in order to be overcome and to be able to move forward.”
He also expressed hope for a settlement of the maritime border dispute, which is being settled in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed the opinion that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if both countries undertake to accept the verdict, however hard it may be."
In connection with the possibility that he will run in the next presidential election in Ecuador to run for a third term, he noted that he perceives this possibility "with great optimism and joy, even if it is sometimes very difficult".
Correa has said that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
“I have never personally been interested in power, but such unjust situations as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador can only be corrected by political power.
My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this probable victory, so we have to accept this responsibility," he said.
“If I won, it would be my last term as president and then I would leave politics.
If we lose, the same thing awaits us.
I have already made my decision," he said.
Correa also mentioned the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Cuba.
“I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who says President Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez has gone to the planned routine treatment and his return to Cuba was expected after the end of the campaign.
"This is not a relapse in the president's health," he said.
The head of state of Ecuador attended today the sixth summit of heads of state and government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with calls for greater regional integration in order to maintain development, equality and security.
AIDS victims are now the result of a late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the result of his HIV-positive test was confirmed.
"It was as if lightning had struck me," he says, recalling a moment of truth that the doctor had tried to "mitigate a little," but apparently without success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take his illness on his own and began to inform himself about it, with such a commitment that he had already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the earliest patients of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he came to in 1994 after several battles with the disease.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) since the age of 22, something that was unimaginable in the early 1990s, when there were a lot of doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) did not say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut wound."
At the time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive with this syndrome and live fully.
However, there are many people who do not know about their disease and come only when the virus has caused the destruction of the body and strengthened the immune system, and then become victims of accidental infections.
31 years since the AIDS epidemic began, or at least since the first documented cases, “means a great success that the life expectancy of a patient who begins treatment in a timely and appropriate manner is exactly the same as that of healthy people,” said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit at the Civil Hospital in Guadalajara, in a statement.
Andrade Villanueva, an HIV/AIDS specialist, explained that scientists have concluded that since 2008, AIDS is not a death sentence, but that the length of survival and full life depends on the degree of impairment of the immune system of patients who are diagnosed with the disease, with those who do not use drugs better: people with 200 to 500 CD4 cells can live with up to 200 CD4 cells.
Simply put, this means that a person diagnosed with HIV at 25 years of age can, according to these findings, "live without problems until 75 years of age while following treatment," the doctor explained in the interview.
To underline this progress, it is worth recalling that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, and in Mexico the number of people who died of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the yearbook of the United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS – UNAIDS), it is also true that 60 percent of patients have died since the discovery of AIDS, according to national statistics.
In the state of Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011 and so far this May 187. However, universal access to antiretrovirals has been ensured since 2005.
- Why do people continue to die from the effects of the disease?
“I don’t think the problem is access to treatment.
This is how I see it, this is how it happens in our hospital.
The problem is that patients come at a very advanced stage because they do not know the state of the disease, that is, at a late stage of the disease."
He adds: “Nine out of ten patients come when an associated infection is already present. The only thing that needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose the disease earlier, and therefore it is necessary to offer large-scale tests to detect the disease to all those who apply for it.”
In his proposal, he agrees with specialists and officials from the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in the state of Jalisco and directly with patients like Fabrizio, who came to be tested in a private laboratory just because it was done by his friend, and despite his young age, he had already developed AIDS and also suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous disease.
“Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die, and they don't want to know anything else.
"If I'm about to die, I'd rather get out three times a week," they say, but that's not my case.
The change was for the better, I eat healthy, I exercise, I take medication.”
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but responsibly, I pay attention to myself and the other person,” Fabrizio, who accepted the call to share his experience with the daily newspaper MILENIO JALISCO, said today, as part of World AIDS Day, to motivate those who are afraid with his testimony.
"Let them take the tests. If they took the risk, let them know as soon as possible if they're HIV positive, that's better. And if they've already been diagnosed, let them realize that they can live like anyone else if they're responsible."
This message summarises the slogan of the battle against AIDS this year 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a big gap between health programs and ordinary citizens, said Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who is researching information about HIV.
And the biggest gaps are in prevention.
“In places that are dedicated to this task, there has really been an increase in the distribution of condoms, they used to give us one or two, today they give us packages and a hundred condoms, which is very good, but there are still people who do not have access to condoms,” he said.
Teenagers are among the most susceptible to new infections.
“What do you want it for?” is a common question full of irony and judgment from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy staff and medical staff who want to avoid teenagers, the reporter says.
He proposed to change this ineffective distribution, so that condoms are not just behind the counters, but that the hundred be in the dispensers in the public toilets, in places where young people often go.
“It’s not supportive of promiscuity.
It’s not even about “paying them a beer and a motel,” as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez reacted to the question of whether he would agree to distribute condoms in his district.
This is not sexuality. It is best to make condoms available to those who already have a sexual life," he said.
Key numbers in the state of Jalisco
There were 13,435 cases (12,158 cases of AIDS and 1,317 cases of HIV).
This is the fourth highest number of new and detected AIDS cases in Mexico and the 13th highest number of HIV cases in the country.
92% of infections occur sexually, 6% in the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that about 50,000 people can live with HIV, as there are four to five people who are unaware of the disease per registered case.
The judgment approved by the United States Court of Appeals, which does not recognise Grupo Vitro’s bankruptcy debt restructuring in Mexico, raises an unfortunate precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country and a solvency problem.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for restructuring companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the country of stripes and stars, despite international agreements.
Approval of the judgment issued on June 15 last year by Judge Harlin Hale in the bankruptcy court for Northern Texas leaves Mexican companies in practice defenseless against the possibility of confiscation of their assets on the other bank of the river el Bravo.
However, the ruling opens the door to the Supreme Court of the United States to the main Mexican glass producer, appealing against three irregularities.
To begin with, while the judge of the case argues that creditors are to be governed by the United States’ insolvency law, the New Orleans-based Court of Appeals of the Fifth District says that the main procedure is to establish bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico.
Firstly, this would indicate the lack of knowledge of international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of multinational enterprises.
In essence, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, which the arbitrator determines the organization of the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the judgment provides that without a vote of the branches of the internal business structure, when the debt of the parent company Vitro to the branches is recognised, the required majority for the approval of the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is allowed by Mexican law.
The fact is that the Vitro case was not the first in which this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, such as Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, of which the Federal Bankruptcy Institute is responsible for in-company debts.
In addition, it is true that even after deducting the votes of the branches, creditors - who opposed Vitro in court in the United States, i.e. "soup" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited - would not reach a majority.
In the poll, they would have reached about 45 percent to 37 percent.
This information is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
From a different point of view, the court blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 - against the backdrop of a serious economic crisis that has hit the United States.
Meanwhile, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sady, a family firm, will appeal to the Court of Appeal for a new review to take place with full participation, i.e. with the participation of five judges, since only three had originally voted.
If it fails here, it will seek as an appeal a review of the process by a higher instance, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The seriousness of the case is that the court has omitted a document sent by the Mexican government as a unit of amicus curiae detailing Vitro’s conduct under the Competition Act and pointing out that the company has eased itself by adhering to agreements signed by both states to confront the Act with Chapter 15 of the United States Act.
Moreover, it points out that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for international insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Impact on both sides: punishment for Vitro and the state.
Overall evaluation
Unnoticed, the Mexican Air Force's criminal complaint against former owner Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who was accused of fraudulent conduct, was on the table for several months, and according to the pilots' union, the vessel had already leaked.
An instance headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a lawsuit against the National Banking Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which he accuses of obstructing the administration of justice.
According to it, the Authority systematically refused to report to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic on the transaction carried out by that entrepreneur, in which he selected 198 million pesos from the IXE fideicomis F/589 on behalf of the Mexican Aviation Company.
The funds were most likely earmarked for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management (Administradora Profesional de Hoteles).
Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is a major shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Siege of Dragon Martu
At the Universidad de Caribe, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and ordinary citizens gathered at the weekend to approve the creation of the association, in order to prevent the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Kankun.
We are talking, as you know, about a huge commercial and distribution center with products from the "Great Wall Country" focused on Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, which would include a residential zone for employees from 150 companies at the bottom.
Previously, Canacintra (C<0xC3><0xA1>mara Nacional de la Industria de Transformaci<0xC3><0xB3>n) had been able to unite the governors of the south-eastern zone to oppose a monumental site that would partially devastate protected areas and which represents the origin of all resistance to industry.
The end of the ACTA document
The motion of the Senate, which the government did not take into account and which demanded an explanation of the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property (Instituto Mexicano de la Propiedad Industrial), was out of date.
As we know, this happened despite the fact that the Senate itself ruled out the possibility of considering it a threat to freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debts and not to affect the short-term ones, Homex is putting 500 million pesos worth of investment certificates on the market.

Investment in business will exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes has been associated with this indoor sport for more than 60 years and travelled the world thanks to him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many memories of the history of local basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was enthusiastic about the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a junior player, BSN National Basketball League player, owner and coach of the Vaqueros de Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n National Basketball League team, or president of the Puerto Rico Basketball Federation.
“I’ve played a lot of roles throughout my life in basketball, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN National League in the 1990s, general manager of the national team, and chairman of the federation,” Reyes recalled visiting Primera Hora reporters at his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he has lived for more than 50 years with his wife, Isabel.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate in his statement.
The walls of his house, which are almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs from his long career, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
With the greatest movement of all, he guards those that remind him of his time in Los Vaqueros from the mid-1950s, where he was a player until 1982, when he also celebrated 15 years as a co-owner or owner of the team.
“It was my best years and I enjoyed them the most because I have had the opportunity to compete with Los Vaqueros since 1967 in eight championships, whether as owner, co-owner or coach.
It was a series of successful years, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one championship - in 1981, when Jerome Mincy debuted at BSN.
At that time, the team took over “Cuco” Ortiz, who was an outstanding leader,” Reyes said.
“I remember Gene Bartow, who used to be here as a coach and at the time worked at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, told me, ‘I have a grown two-meter player for you.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who became a member of the team and one of our top scorers.
I remember he said that if Mincy brings Bayamon a championship win, Gauss will contribute to the next one.”
Gausse enjoyed the championship when he played for Los Vaqueros, but only at a distance, as he was already president of the basketball federation in 1988.
At that time, he wanted to fully devote himself to his duties and enjoy Mincy's position on the national team.
“I remember the first time we beat the United States in the 1989 Olympic Qualifying match in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished quarters, but we should have had bronze if it wasn't for the Canadian referee who let us repeat the final throw," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, as well as the one who defeated the Dream Team at the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the national team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we splattered the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that blew us bronze at the World Cup.
This team had not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>na" (Ortiz), but there were also young men (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Col<0xC3><0xB3>n and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be in the team in 1990 due to injury.
The team, which may not have had a perfect line-up, but managed to win a gold medal and bring great joy, was the team from the Olympic qualification in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players on the roster such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and junior player Rolando Hourruitiner, who replaced the players excluded due to the fight at the Pan American Games in Mar de Plata, we won gold despite all the predictions.
What was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His numbers from international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has achieved such results at this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Not to mention his performances in the various leagues where he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
That's very hard.
We had a very good generation, which includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau and Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider to be your greatest success in the Federation?
That I was part of the most famous era of the national team from 1988 to 1995 and that in the early 1990s the national league BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What did you fail to prove?
There were things I wanted to introduce, such as the division of youth categories by regions.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and compete with teams from other parts of the island only in the national play-offs.
Now children travel a lot and play too many games, which is not necessary.
I also see benefits in mandatory certifications and courses for coaches, referee assistants and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
I listen to music most of all, watch YouTube videos with music from my time, enjoy grandchildren and sometimes go to basketball matches.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, who was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, was world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the Dallas television series, in which he embodied a man who acted ruthlessly and was insidious and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the Dallas television series became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned as J.R. in a new Dallas series this year, died according to an official announcement by the family, which was provided to the Associated Press by Dallas production company Warner Bros., on Friday afternoon of complications associated with cancer.
"Larry returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he played the iconic role he loved the most," his family said in a statement.
Larry's family and his closest friends were in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
"Linda Gray, who represented his wife in both the original and the new series, was with Hagman the moment he died in a Dallas hospital," her agent, Jeffrey Lane, said in a statement.
He brought joy to everyone he knew.
"He was creative, generous, funny, kind, kind and talented, and I will miss him terribly.
He was unique and lived his life to the fullest,” said Linda Gray in a statement.
The Hagmans were diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he himself admitted that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a cancerous tumor was found on his liver, and Hagman underwent a transplant.
Years before the Dallas series aired, Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light-hearted NBC comedy I Dream of Jeannie from 1965 to 1970.
Here he played the character of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive girl (a gin), played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live together.
He was also the protagonist in two short-lived comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His roles in the films included roles that were well received by critics: The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was only Hangman's masterful performance in the form of an incredibly repulsive J.R. that led him to the top of the stars.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other personalities around them was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional slogan "Who Shot Jayar?", which was supposed to arouse expectations about the work full of emotions, when Hangman's character is almost murdered, caused not only a huge number of speculation from viewers around the world, but also the risk of millions of dollars in the price offices.
This also helped this work to achieve a record in the audience.
The November 1980 episode, in which the answer was revealed, was watched by an average of 41 million television viewers, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment show in history after the end of the 1983 TV series MASH, which was watched by 50 million viewers.
J.R. was shot by his sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby).
Kristin and J.R. got pregnant, and he then threatened to label her a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but there were others who had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing, an insatiable greedy man with a charismatic smile: a cunning businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to keep his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) locked up in a hospital.
“I know what I want J.R. to have on the tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only thing that didn't work out for him.
Victoria Principal, who starred in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone who was "great on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of admirers in the world and in the hearts of all of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas series were broadcast by TNT a few months ago with great success.
"Five episodes of the second series have already been completed and the sixth is just being filmed," the television station said.
Immediately after Hangman's death, there was no statement from Warner or TNT on how the series would proceed.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shined in classics such as the musicals South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Mary Martin was a very young girl when she gave birth to Larry, whose father was her husband, lawyer Ben Hagman, in 1931.
In the early 1950s, Larry tried his luck on theater stages in New York and then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson, whom he married.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in Malibu, California, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he published his autobiographical book Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
"I didn't put anything in there that I knew could hurt someone or hurt them in any way," he told Prensa Asociada.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital, where he helped fearful patients.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them comfort in the sense of "don't worry, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a while, but you'll be healthy."
He was also an activist in the fight against smoking and participated in various campaigns.
Starts a course that explores the "end of the world"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
When religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to take a course on the end of the world this semester, he knew it was an irresistible lure: The end of the "long number" of the Mayan calendar, which is due to come on December 21, was seized by many people as proof that the end of the world was coming.
Charmé, however, had no idea what awaited him in the next few months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the budget chasm that some call “the debt Armageddon,” and the growing conflict into which Israel is drawn, the place where, according to Christians theorizing the end of the world, the Apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey.
When one discusses what is happening in the world today, as if we have 30 days left, this is a really good time.
And remember that bad means good for the apocalyptic.
And this is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" in this semester, which is theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker organizes the course "Resources, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re looking at why these ideas spread over time,” he says, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that drive certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war may break out.
This month, students analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they differ from real-life examples.
“I tried to inform students about what is possible, likely, plausible, and impossible,” Vacker says.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, came together to organize a course called The End of the World.
"We don't connect '2012' because we always count on the possibility of re-arranging the course if the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent destruction" students have to study, create projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be held on the eve of the Apocalypse, giving students no choice but to work "until the evening of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
Courses have become quite popular.
"It stretched out in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, 35 of whom signed up.
Weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, we were asked by e-mail if there was still room.
The students themselves assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves,” 23-year-old Bridgid Robinson, a student of religion and sociology at Haddonfield, New Jersey, told Rutgers University in Camden.
Therefore, apocalyptic, secular or religious thinking is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of an hour in which it could be taught," he said.
"I'm enjoying it."
But no conscientious student, let alone a professor, said he believed in the end of December.
“Our first project was about the Mayan prediction, and we’re refuting it in some way,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple University in West Chester.
"The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar," Restall said.
But he added that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture that goes back several centuries, with which people react to changes in their surroundings with predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has caused this speculation to flourish.
"People don't think about it anywhere else," he said.
This happens for the most part in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who is giving a lecture in the Philippines this year, answered quickly when asked if he knew of any “end of the world” course there.
“The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world,” he wrote, indicating an exception at the top office.
We have the grace of the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the final judgment had been talked about over the years, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, "people would immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world would disappear.
The date is taken lightly by students and professors.
Several have said they intend to go to the "end of the world" celebration.
"I guess I'll call a few friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
