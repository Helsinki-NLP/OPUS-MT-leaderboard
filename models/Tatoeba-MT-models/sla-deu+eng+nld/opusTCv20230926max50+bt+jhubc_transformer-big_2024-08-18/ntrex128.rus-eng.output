Members of the Wales Assembly do not want to “like the Muppets”
Among some members of the National Assembly is growing dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt for their name the abbreviation MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The problematic solution is related to the plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One Labour official, expressing his party’s opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “rhyms Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers not from Wales: in Welsh twp means "stupid", and pwp - "kakashka".
According to a member of the Assembly from the Party of Wales, his organization as a whole “remained dissatisfied” and proposed other options.
Representatives of the conservative party “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that the MWP is close to the word Muppet (muppet).
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced roughly as the letter u in the Yorkshire dialect of English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently developing a draft law on the name change, made the following statement: “The final decision on the name of the Assembly Members will, of course, remain with them.”
Under the 2017 Welsh Governance Act, the National Assembly of Wales is empowered to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion poll on the proposed options, according to which the option “Parliament of Wales” instead of “Assembly” found widespread support among the local population.
As for the name of the members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP) option, while the MWP option received the greatest public support.
Apparently, members of the Assembly offer other options, but the Presiding Member, Elin Jones, will not be easy to find a satisfactory solution. Recall that the draft law on amendments should be submitted in a few weeks.
The reform laws will include other modifications to the Assembly ' s work process, including new rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the organization of the Committee ' s system.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the final version of their name during the debate on the bill.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum on changing the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians will vote to rename the country the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The popular vote is intended to resolve a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims on the Greek province, and has repeatedly spoken out against the accession of its northern neighbor to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he was not going to recognize its results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that changing the name of the country is just the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The crisis in the parishes of Harlem: forever silenced the bells of St. Martin
“The area’s elders, whom I spoke with, said that before there was a bar and a church at every corner,” Adams said.
"And now there's nothing left."
The disappearance of bars can still be understood:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“The bar has ceased to be a kind of living room of the whole area, where they came regularly.”
But as for the churches, the worry is that the funds received from the sale of assets will not last long, no matter how much their leaders hope for it. “Sooner or later they will be left with nothing.”
On the site of the church, he added, will be an apartment building, whose tenants are unlikely to support the surviving parishes in the area.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” Adams said, “and that will bring the day closer when such churches will finally close, because new neighbors will never become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white congregations even before Harlem became a black district: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and the Church of St. Martin 10 years later.
The first parishioners of the Methodist Church left the parish in the 30s of the last century.
Their building was bought by a black parish located next door.
When St. Martin's Church passed into the hands of the black community, it was headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who organized a boycott of shops on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
In 1939, the building suffered significant damage as a result of the fire, and during the restoration work, the parishioners of Father Johnson ordered the installation of a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Johnson’s father, who succeeded him at the head of St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the carillon “bells for the poor.”
But the expert who tested the carillon in July called it differently: “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool.”
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the St. Martin's Carillon that was the world's first instrument of its kind played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play on a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
According to Merriweather, the church of St. Martin has not yet found a replacement for him.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s Church there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom have been invited by the secular leaders of the church, others by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
The congregation of parishioners, the governing body of the parish, which includes secular leaders, appealed to the diocese in July, expressing concern that the diocese would “try to shift the cost of the works” to the congregation of parishioners, although the latter had nothing to do with the choice of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
In California, a shark injured a 13-year-old diver who was fishing for lobsters
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster hunting season, in California, a 13-year-old diver was attacked by a shark and injured.
The attack occurred around 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel in an interview with KSWB-TV (San Diego), on Saturday morning he dived with friends and about half an hour later heard the screams of the boy for help. Together with friends, they swam on a boat to the attack site and pulled the teenager out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he decided that the boy was loudly happy to catch the lobster, but quickly “realized that he was shouting “I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
Sailing to the diver, Hammel noted that "he had completely torn the skin around his collarbone."
“I shouted to get everyone out of the water, ‘Here’s a shark!’” said Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Children's Hospital of Rady (San Diego); his condition is assessed as critical.
The species of the shark that attacked the teenager is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles reported in a press briefing that a shark had been spotted at the site a few weeks ago but had not been classified as a dangerous species.
Giles also added that the victim suffered injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities blocked the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury plans to conquer the UK perfume and cosmetics market
Sainsbury is going to install cosmetics and perfumery departments in Boots, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with consultant cosmetologists, modelled on luxury department stores.
The UK perfume and cosmetics market is valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to expand, while in the fashion and home goods sector sales are falling. To capture a significant share of this desirable market as an experiment in 11 stores across the country, spacious cosmetics and perfume departments will be presented, and if successful next year they should be expected in many other stores.
Supermarket owners are looking for something to fill the shelves previously allocated for TVs, microwave ovens, home goods, and investment in the perfume and cosmetics market seems to be a good solution.
According to the representatives of Sainsbury, it is planned to double the range of cosmetic products to 3,000 items, including for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will be offered.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be presented on a larger scale, in specially designated locations, by the type of organization of goods in Boots stores.
In addition, the branded line of products "Boutique cosmetics" will be reorganized with the transition to vegan products to meet the needs of young buyers.
Two Sainsbury stores will feature Fragrance Shop perfume kiosks: the first has already opened in Croydon, south London last week, and the second is expected to open in Sellie Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products every day in small shops near the house have led to supermarkets being forced to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Coop, president of Sainsbury, says outlets will gradually turn into department stores, and his supermarket chain is battling for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food items.
Hundreds of Sainsbury supermarkets house Argos outlets, and some of them now have Habitats stores since the chain acquired both brands two years ago. This has led to increased food sales and revenues from these acquisitions.
Previous attempts of the supermarket to give new life to its cosmetics and pharmacy departments have not been crowned with success.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Sainsbury and Boots was organized, but later there were disagreements between the participants regarding the division of the income from the sale of pharmacy goods in supermarkets.
The new strategy was developed after the sale of the Sainsbury pharmaceutical business (a total of 281 stores) to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years earlier.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a wide range of luxury skin care products to La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury, said: “We have completely transformed the look and feel of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more conducive environment for our customers.
We have also invited specially trained consultants who will always be ready to help with the advice.
Our range of brands for every taste, pleasant design and convenient location of shops will attract many visitors in search of cosmetics and perfumes. This will be a completely new concept of shopping.”
Peter Jones reacted “wrathfully” to Holly Willoughby’s withdrawal from the deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
Star of the show “Dragon Log” Peter Jones is “outraged” by the exit of TV presenter Holly Willoughby from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, which she was supposed to conclude with Peter’s lifestyle brand, but instead chose new contracts with “Marx and Spencer” and ITV
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their shared brand of Truly homewear and accessories.
The couple’s business was compared to the Goop brand of actress Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old host of the program “This Morning” announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s decision to leave their lucrative lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with “Marx & Spencer” and ITV has angered Peter Jones, the Star of the Dragon.
According to our sources, Jones was “infuriated” when a TV favorite during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that after signing new contracts worth up to 1.5 million, she would not have enough time for their common brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
Their brand was compared to the child of actress Gwyneth Paltrow by the Goop brand, and its sales were expected to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
The 37-year-old host announced her departure on Instagram, Jones himself left the UK on a private jet in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would ensure her carefree existence for the next couple of decades.
Her decision stupefied all the participants in the transaction.
Everyone was stunned by what happened on Tuesday, because before the launch of the brand there were only a few weeks left.
At the headquarters in Marlow, there was a whole warehouse filled with ready-to-sell goods.”
Experts believe that the departure of the leading “This Morning”, one of the most popular stars in the UK, may cost the firm millions of pounds due to significant investments in goods, from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as the potential delay in the launch of the line.
In addition, it is about the breakup of long-standing friendships.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand together with Tara Capp in 2016, and Tara’s husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, headed the company’s board in March.
The two couples often spend their holidays together, and Jones also owns a 40% stake in television production firm Dan Baldwin.
Willoughby will be the M&S ambassador and will replace Anthony McPartlin as the host of ITV’s “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We can’t comment on his commercial affairs.”
Difficult negotiations, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism that the media would throw at him because of the “unworthy president” comment and the positive assessment of the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump drop so many claims?
Trump said, imitating the voice of the news anchor.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim Jong-un is interested in reuniting after Trump called their first summit held in Singapore in June a significant step towards reducing North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile.
Negotiations on denuclearization are at an impasse.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, a senior North Korean diplomat, Lee Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at a UN General Assembly meeting on Saturday with a statement that North Korea still awaits a “appropriate response” from the United States following North Korea’s initial disarmament measures.
Instead, the U.S. continues to use sanctions as a lever of pressure.
During the meeting of his supporters, President Trump expressed a much more optimistic assessment.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Jong Un have brought fruit: an end to missile tests was put to, hostages were released, and the remaining U.S. military personnel in the DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Speaking about his relationship with Kim Jong Un, Trump stressed that there is nothing strange about his unusual approach to diplomacy.
“Behaving like a president is so easy, but then instead of 10,000 people on the street bursting into this fully packed hall, there would be only 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to a crowd gathered in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia: recorded catastrophic destruction, victims count in the hundreds
In the first days after the earthquake that struck Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had lost their roof over their heads, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare a national natural disaster, which is a prerequisite for receiving international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have clearly made it clear that they do not need international support, so it was not easy,” says Selina Sambung.
Save the Children is preparing a team to be sent to Palu, but we do not yet know if a foreign group will be able to work on the ground.
According to Mr. Sutopo, the official representative of the National Disaster Management Authority, Indonesia ' s leadership is conducting an assessment of the situation in Palu to determine whether it is appropriate to involve international organizations.
Given the ongoing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country remains horribly ill-prepared for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found on other coastlines.
Despite the tsunami warning, no warning siren was included in Palu, which is likely to have resulted in so many casualties.
Transport between the numerous Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The floating hospital, previously docked in Lombok to help earthquake victims, is heading to Palu, but the road to the site of the new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the strengthening of Indonesia’s slump a focal point of his election campaign and has spent incalculable funds to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joko, who is running for a new term next year, is mired in funding problems.
The president has also been criticized for intensifying interfaith feuds between Indonesia’s conservative Muslim majority and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed and tens of thousands more lost their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed machetes, bows with arrows and other crossbows.
Video: Liverpool player Daniel Starridge compares the score in the match against Chelsea goal in the far top corner of the goal
Daniel Starrige saved Liverpool from a loss in the 89th minute of the Premier League match against Chelsea, which took place on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium.
Starridge received a pass from Jerdan Shakiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal, when his team lost 1-0.
He moved to the left and pierced the far corner of the gate.
The ball flew high and found itself in the far upper corner of the grid.
Capa Arrisabalaga jumped in the direction of the ball, but it was too late.
In an interview with LiverpoolFC.com, Starrige said: “The whole point was to be in that position and get the ball, players like Shack are always playing at their best, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible.”
“I saw that Kante was heading towards me, I took possession of the ball and, thinking for a short time, I pierced the gate.”
Following the results of the first half of the match, the Chelsea team led with a score of 1-0, a goal in the 25th minute was scored by the Belgian Eden Hazard.
Chelsea's central striker, passing the pass back to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, broke through the middle of the field halfway to Liverpool.
In the middle of the field Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> played a one-touch game.
Then he passed the pass to Azar, who went out to the gate.
Hazard overtook the defense and struck from the left flank by circumventing Liverpool goalkeeper Alison Becker, hitting the far corner of the grid.
"Liverpool" will meet with the team "Napoli" in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the stadium "San Paolo" in Naples (Italy) on Wednesday at 15:00.
Chelsea will play with the club "Videoton" in the UEFA Euroleague match, which will be held on Thursday in London, also at 15:00.
Indonesia tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the National Disaster Management Authority said on Sunday morning.
According to reports, a lot of people remain under the ruins of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale. The earthquake occurred on Friday and caused a tsunami with waves up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, the official representative of the Office, told a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from collapsed houses.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Man Suspected of Inflicting Deadly Knife Wounds on Woman
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman with stabbing wounds was found at 7:55 in the Grayson Muse complex on John Street. On suspicion of murder arrested 32-year-old man.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the murder among local residents.
Criminal Police Inspector O’Haigen said: “The investigation is in its infancy, but I strongly urge anyone who has been in the John Street area of Birkenhead and has been able to observe or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have recorded something on the DVR. Please contact us with any information that can help the investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the victim was living in Birkenhead and her body was found in the compound.
This afternoon, the alleged victims came to the scene to ask their questions about where she was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police are preparing to report on the tragedy of the victim’s immediate relatives.

When he heard about it, he lost his ability to speak.
Residents of the house were told that they would not be able to get home for at least several hours.
One policeman told the tenant that the entire surrounding area was considered a crime scene.
One woman was crying.
“What a horror!” she repeated.
At 2 a.m., two police buses arrived at the scene, and another one remained outside the fenced area.
Several police officers were placed inside the fence to watch the apartment complex.
Anyone with any information is asked to send a private message to <0x40>MerPolCC on Twitter, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 (case 247 of September 30).
Cromwell's monument in front of parliament building sparked fierce debate about "rewriting history"
Cromwell’s “expulsion” would be a well-deserved retribution for the barbaric destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious artifacts by his followers, the Puritan fanatics.
However, Cromwell’s Memory Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “crazy” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Memorial Society, said: “As part of the ongoing debate over the demolition of historic monuments, the question of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace inevitably arose.
Cromwell had nothing to do with the iconoclastic movement during the English Civil Wars.
Oliver Cromwell probably suffers for the sins of his ancestor, Thomas, who lived a century earlier.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Tornicroft reflects the opinion of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of a man whom many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith stated: "Many people, especially in the late 19th century, considered Cromwell a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of debate by experts.
But it is safe to say that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century influenced the subsequent development of our country, and Cromwell was a significant historical figure representing one side of this section.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve high praise and respect.”
A Chinese farmer was bitten to death by a killer pig
In a market in southwestern China, a farmer has fallen victim to a pig, local media reported.
The bloodied body of the victim (the media mentions only his name, "Yuan") with a torn artery was found next to a barn in a market in the district of Lupanshui in the province of Guizhou in southern China.
The pig farmer is preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm, on May 30, 2005, in Xinying District, Qinghai Province, China.
Yuan and his cousin arrived from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
The next morning, Yuan’s body was found dead, and the door to a nearby pig farm was opened.
In the pig farm there was a huge rattlesnake with blood on it.
During the forensic examination, it was found that the pig weighing 250 kilograms bit the farmer to death.
“My brother’s legs were bleeded and mutilated,” said Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the victim.
CCTV footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The killer pig did not belong to the brothers.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was isolated in a separate detachment for the duration of the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
Yuan's family is reportedly in talks with the market administration to compensate for the farmer's death.
Swine attacks on humans are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the US state of Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-pound animal nailed a Welsh farmer to a tractor and let him go, only afraid of his late wife.
In 2012, there was a case where a farmer from Oregon in the United States was eaten by his own pigs. As one Canadian farmer told CBC News, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “trigger”.
“Pigs are playing.
They are biting and very curious, but they have no intention of offending you.
You just need to instill in your animals a sense of measure and respect,” he explained.
Hurricane Rosa will bring rains to much of the southwest of the United States
According to the forecast, Hurricane Rosa is losing power as it moves through a zone with cooler water to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days it will bring rainfall and flooding to the territory of northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
As of Saturday, 5 a.m. in New York City, the cyclone has reached Category 1 with winds of up to 135 km/h, located 360 km southwest of the city of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The storm is expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low-pressure zone begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. Approaching the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical humidity north of Mexico, to the territory of the southwest of the United States.
More than 25 cm of rain is expected in Mexico on Monday.
Under the influence of tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone, heavy rainfall is expected in the Southwest in the coming days.
Precipitation from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous rainfall floods, mudstone flows and possible landslides in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, due to the high tropical humidity, the precipitation rate can reach 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In some areas of the southwestern United States, mostly in most of Arizona, up to 5–10 cm of precipitation is expected.
The risk of sudden fast-moving floods due to uneven distribution of tropical rains is not excluded.
With the existing risk of tropical rain, walking in the desert is fraught with serious consequences.
Drifts can turn canyons into turbulent rivers, and thunder can sometimes cause gusty winds and raise clouds of dust.
With the emergence of a low-pressure zone in places on the coast of southern California will collapse showers.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small mudstone flows and create slippery surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall since the beginning of the rainy season in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, Arizona will experience some tropical rains, which will spread to other areas by Monday evenings and Tuesday mornings.
By Tuesday, the rains will pass in the area of the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday evening.
In October, there will be sharp temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, due to low air temperatures in the Arctic at fairly high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to strong temperature changes in a small area.
Such sharp temperature drops will be particularly noticeable in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between the temperatures in Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will accumulate and spread to other areas.
In most of the central and eastern territories of the United States, warm weather is expected in early October, the temperature will reach 27 degrees in space from the Southern Plains to the Northeast of the country.
In New York on Tuesday, the air temperature can rise to 27 degrees, which is 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises with a high probability unusually high temperatures on the east coast of the United States until mid-October.
The Senate hearing in the case of Judge Brett Kavanaugh saw more than 20 million viewers
The testimony of Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blaze Ford, who accuses Kavanaugh of attempted rape committed in the 1980s, attracted the attention of more than 20 million viewers of six TV channels on Thursday.
Political confrontation over Kavanaugh's candidacy received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, the media received an urgent message: Republican Jeff Flake put forward a condition that the accusations against a lawyer within one week to investigate the FBI.
Ford told a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that she was “100 percent sure” that Kavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh testified emotionally, stating that he was 100 percent certain that this was not the case.
According to research agency Nielsen, Friday’s debate was watched by more than 20.4 million viewers.
The agency took into account the average data from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Audience figures for other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
In addition, the Nielsen rating does not always take into account viewers watching TV at work.
For comparison, we are talking about the average audience watching the American football match in the playoffs or the Oscar ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose presenters fervently supported Kavanaugh’s appointment: Senate hearings that lasted all day were watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reported.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had an audience of 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reports.
After the hearings, interest in the case did not weaken.
On Friday, there was a real drama with the participation of Jeff Flake.
After the Arizona senator, who is considered a moderate Republican, announced his intention to support Kavanaugh’s candidacy, CNN and CBS managed to capture on camera how on Friday morning on his way to a meeting of the Legal Committee, Flake met in an elevator with a group of activists who criticized the senator.
The whole world saw him, lowering his eyes, get a whimper from angry women live on CNN.
“I stand before you,” said one of them.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“There is power behind you, while so many women are powerless,” she said.
Flake replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and he would speak on this topic at the committee meeting. The elevator doors closed, hiding the senator from ubiquitous cameras.
When a few hours later the Legal Committee was preparing to approve Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of judge and send her to the Senate for a general vote, all TV channels broadcast the meeting live.
However, Flake has made one condition – to conduct an FBI investigation into the allegations against the candidate by next week, as the democratic minority has been seeking.
Flake claims that he changed his mind due to the intervention of a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
He made the final decision after talking to Koons and several other senators.
Flake's decision had an effect, as it was obvious that the Republicans lacked the votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting an investigation.
By order of President Trump, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses her critics of “political games” around the Brexit situation
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians criticizing her plan to leave the European Union of placing narrow-party interests above public interests.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom arrives at the conference of the conservative party in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published on one page of May’s interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called “Shashka” Brexit plan, saying that he considers the introduction of customs duties between the UK and the EU “absolutely ridiculous”.
Wade Sims' death in gunfight: Police arrest Dayton Simpson on suspicion of murdering University of Louisiana striker
Police have arrested a man suspected of killing Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player who played for Louisiana State University.
According to Baton Rouge police, Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and placed in custody on second-degree murder charges.
Police released a video of a fight involving Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his glasses.
According to WAFB, the regional CBS channel, police found Simpson’s DNA on glasses found at the crime scene.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted that he had fatally wounded Wade.
According to Advocate, a $350,000 pledge has been set for Simpson.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton Rouge on Friday published a preliminary conclusion: the death was caused by a cross-cutting combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division pays tribute to the Louisiana State Police Criminal Investigation Department, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the locals who assisted in the investigations that led to the detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked law enforcement for their “fair work in capturing the offender.”
Sims was only 20 years old.
The two-meter forward was a native of Baton Rouge; his father Wayne also played on the team of Louisiana State University.
Last season, Sims scored 5.6 points and made 2.6 rebounds on average per game.
Team coach Will Wade made a statement Friday morning, saying the tragic death of Wade Sims caused "shock" and "real grief" for all players.
“That’s what I’ve always been afraid of,” the coach added.
The volcano covered the ashes of Mexico City
The volcano Popocatepetl covered the southern suburbs of the Mexican capital with ashes.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center advised people not to approach the volcano: its crater recorded activity and produced 183 steam and gas emissions per day.
According to the Center’s observations, there was often a roaring and trembling near the volcano.
In some areas of Mexico City, such as Sochimilco, social media users posted photos of the windshields of cars covered in a thin layer of ash.
After the 7.1Mw earthquake that shook central Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists recorded increased volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the capital.
Popocatepetl (or, for its own, "Don Goyo") has been an active volcano since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona held a multi-thousand rally to mark the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which split the country into two camps. There were clashes between supporters of independence of autonomy and police; six participants of the riots were detained.
Police have pushed back protesting independence supporters, while the latter, dressed in black masks, threw eggs and powder paint at the guards, raising clouds of dark dust in the heart of Barcelona.
After the police launched batons to contain the crowd, the riots resumed with renewed force.
For several hours the supporters of independence chanted, "We will not forget, we will not forgive!" and their opponents answered them with the slogan: "Long live Spain!".
According to local press reports, fourteen participants of the action were taken to the hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain. It was recognized as illegal by the Spanish government, but became an important milestone for the separatists. A year later, tensions persist in the sovereign region.
Catalonia voted overwhelmingly to leave Spain, but the turnout was low due to the fact that opponents of the exit mostly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to block the holding of a referendum in the country's polling stations in violent clashes.
On Friday, separatists spent the night on the declared path of following a demonstration in support of the Spanish police to prevent it from taking place.
The demonstration still took place, but went on a different route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, who attended a separatist rally in the company of his wife, complains that the hope of Catalonia’s acquisition of sovereignty is becoming increasingly shaky.
“Last year was one of the most important events in our lives.
My parents were crying with happiness, having the opportunity to vote in a referendum, and today we are in a suspended state,” he says.
In the recent December local elections, the Catalan parties in favor of secession from Spain won an important victory, albeit with a slight margin. However, this year their movement loses supporters, as many of the well-known leaders of the movement are either on the run or in custody, awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records a police-supported rally on his phone, said the conflict is heating up on both sides of the political spectrum.
“The tension is growing,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan separatist leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament next year.
“Participation in the next European Parliament elections as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: car crashed into house, all three accomplices arrested
One of the houses in Londonberry was rammed several times by a car; the men in it, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested.
The raid was made on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time in the Ballinagard area of Crescent.
As a result, the ram damaged the gate and the building itself, according to the inspector of the criminal police Bob Blemmings.
There are reports that a bowshot may have been fired into the car.
Livingstone's victory over Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
The first goal Dolly Mengy brought a guaranteed victory to the team “Livingston”
With the goal scored, Livingstone won an unexpected victory over the Rangers. For the head coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerrard, this is only the second defeat in 18 games.
Dolly Mengy's exact strike equalized Gary Holt's team with Hibernian in the standings, where they share second place.
Gerrard's club was left without a victory on the road this season of the Premier League. On Sunday they will meet with the leaders of the group, the "Harts", from which the "Rangers" are behind by eight points.
On Thursday, the Rangers will hold a match of the Europa League against the Austrian club Rapid (Vienna).
Livingstone continue their win-win series in the division, having played six games and not won a single loss since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the team's head coach.
Lost Moments for “Livingstone” in a battle with aggressive guests
Coach Holt's wards had to keep score from the start - the Rangers clearly did not cope with their pressure.
Scott Robinson managed to break through the line of defense, but the goal from his weak attempt did not come out. Then defender Alan Litgow, waving too far, could not prevent the ball of Kaig Halkett to get into the net.
The host side allowed the Rangers to play in front of their line of defense, counting on the dangerous moments when the game resumed.
That’s how they missed this important goal.
The Rangers conceded a free kick, and Livingston took the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made the transfer to Menge, who scored from a central position.
By that time, the Rangers had the upper hand in possession of the ball, but the defense of the host team was impenetrable, so goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not worried.
The second half continued in the same pattern, although Kelly still had to repel the blow from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked the ball from Scott Pittman, and Litgow made a wide feed from the standard position.
Balls were constantly hitting the Livingstone penalty room, but all attacks were repelled, and two penalties demands – one for provoking reserve player Glenn Middleton Halkett and the other for playing by hand – were not met.
"Phenomenal" game "Livingstone" - analysis
From BBC Scotland – Alasder Lamont, reportage from the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and a great result for the Livingston team.
Absolutely all the players were great and once again exceeded all expectations, continuing their ascent to the football Olympus.
Their style of play and composition have not changed much since their rise to the top of the rankings, and the great merit of Coach Holt is that he mobilized this team from the very beginning.
There were a lot of real heroes on his team.
Captain Halkett led a brilliantly organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warall from relaxing.
At the same time, the Rangers could not enter the rhythm.
“Although they had some good moments with coach Gerrard, this time they didn’t live up to our expectations.
In the last minutes of the match, they lacked possession of the ball, and they managed to pass the defense of the host team only once. Rangers, who fell in the middle of the table, there is something to think about.
Erdogan's cool reception during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast, the weather was fine, and both of the top officials were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s visit to Germany with the aim of establishing relations between the two NATO member states – a visit already associated with some conflicts.
The heads of state failed to find understanding on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
After Erdogan went to Cologne to take part in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
Cologne has the largest Turkish diaspora outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, police did not allow a crowd of 25,000 to enter the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan were stationed nearby to see their president.
In the same place, opponents of the Erdogan regime, including the Kurds, gathered to condemn both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to visit Germany.
The presence of radically opposite points of view at the meeting reflects the ambiguous nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots praise Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Deptford Road Accident: Collision with a Car Leads to the Death of a Cyclist
In London, a car collided with a cyclist who died at the scene.
The accident occurred near Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy intersection in the southeastern part of the city of Depfort, around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car and the paramedics who arrived at the scene tried to help the cyclist, but the man died without coming to consciousness.
This is not the only fatal accident in the area: just one and a half kilometers from the scene, on Childers Street, another cyclist was hit by a car whose driver fled.
The London police said that work was underway to identify the deceased and notify his immediate relatives.
Meanwhile, roads are blocked at the scene and the bus route has been changed: motorists are asked not to drive into the area.
Long-Lartin Prison Riots: Six Police Officers Wounded
According to the Long Lartin administration, six police officers were injured in the riots in the men ' s high-security prison.
In the men's prison of the strict regime of Long-Lartin (Wustershire) from Sunday continued riots, which began around 09:30 local time.
The Tornado Task Force was called in to suppress the riots involving eight prisoners from the same wing.
The police received minor damage to the soft tissues of the face; they were provided with medical care on the spot.
According to a prison official, “specially trained staff were recruited to resolve the incident at the Long Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We categorically condemn the use of physical force in our institution, and it is obvious that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their measure of restraint may be changed for a longer period of time.”
Long Laryn currently holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager was hospitalized after being attacked by one of the inmates.
In October last year, prison authorities were forced to recruit special forces to reassure rabid prisoners who threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa could flood Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit arid areas)
Arizona rarely gets into the zone of intense tropical cyclone, but this time it is “lucky”: early next week, Hurricane Rosa, having made the last hurdle, must pass over the desert part of the Southwest and bring with it the risk of storm surges.
The National Weather Service has already warned of the threat of storm surges on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, in southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass in a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and flood on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service's office in Phoenix said on Twitter that "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status, within a radius of 320 km from Phoenix, since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) passed 65 km from the border of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, from 5 to 10 cm of precipitation will fall, sometimes reaching 15 cm on the Arizona Mogolion-Rome plateau.
In other desert regions of the Southwest, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, rainfall of up to 2.5–5 cm may reach 10 cm.
For the areas that the storms will bypass, the rain brought by Hurricane Rosa can be a real blessing, because the region has been suffering from drought for a long time.
While storm surges can be dangerous, heavy rains can ease the dry season not taking place in the Southwest of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor maps, more than 40% of Arizona is experiencing at least a severe drought (the second most severe category).
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican state of Lower California.
As of Sunday morning, the hurricane, which has a top speed of 137 km/h, is 360 km south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane found itself in a zone with cooler water on the Pacific coast and thus loses its strength.
In the afternoon, the hurricane will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
It is expected that in some areas of Mexico there will be heavy rainfall with the threat of flooding.
“In the territory from Lower California to the northwest of Sonora can fall up to 7-10 cm of precipitation, in places up to 25 cm,” — said the website weather.com.
Next, Hurricane Rosa will head north through Mexican territory and will reach the Arizona border in the tropical cyclone category early Tuesday morning. From Arizona it will reach the southern part of Utah by Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remnants is associated with heavy rains in Lower California, in the northwestern part of Sonora and in the desert areas of the southwestern United States,” the National Meteorological Service said in a statement.
Precipitation is expected to cause dangerous flooding, mudstone flows in the desert and possible landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Suspects Arrested in Murder Attempt
In Somerset, a 16-year-old teenager received severe knife wounds. On suspicion of attempted murder, three teenagers and a 20-year-old young man were detained.
The victim of the attack with severe injuries was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of the city of Midsomer Norton at about 4 am on Saturday.
After hospitalization, his condition is assessed as “stable”.
On the same night, four suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset County Police said.
Police are looking for possible witnesses to the crime, with any video recordings of what happened on the mobile phone.
Donald Trump: “All the hatred, all the anger” of the Democrats fell on Kavanaugh”
“A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and outrageous tactics used by the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Willinga, West Virginia.
According to Trump, in the process of approving Kavanaugh’s nomination for the candidate “all the hatred, all the anger” of the Democratic Party fell on him.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, in an emotional address categorically rejecting Christina Blaise Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her more than 30 years ago when they were both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also testified during the hearing on her charges.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh’s approval is the vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an undisturbed state record,” the president told a crowd of his associates in West Virginia.
In his speech, the president indirectly raised the issue of Kavanaugh’s nomination, speaking about the importance of Republicans’ turnout in the elections to Congress and the House of Representatives.
“There are only five weeks left until the most important elections in our lives.
I don’t participate in them, but I participate in the race in a different way,” he said.
“I wear it like a burnout and fight for our great candidates.”
Trump believes that the Democrats have set themselves the task of “with all their might to resist us.”
According to the rules, the first key vote in the Senate to approve the candidacy of Kavanaugh should take place no later than Friday, said an assistant to a high-ranking representative of the Republican party.
Earthquake in Indonesia kills hundreds and the total number of victims continues to rise
Indonesian authorities announced on Saturday that at least 384 people had been killed, many carried away by gigantic waves capturing the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, which was hit by an incredible tsunami and earthquake.
The first victims of the disaster were hundreds of guests of the beach festival in the city of Palu. On Friday, at sunset, the coast was overtaken by waves almost six meters high, which dared everything in their path and led to the instant death of many of those present.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach vacation instead of running into shelter immediately and lost their lives,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official with Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Authority, told a news conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come one, the flow of water was cars, logs, whole houses, the element destroyed everything in its path,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km / h and hit the coast with all the force.
Some of those present climbed into the trees, which saved their lives.
Some 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Palu.
The aerial photography of the disaster management department shows destroyed houses, shops, collapsed bridges and a flooded mosque.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still shaken by tremors.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy output caused by the earthquake was about 200 times greater than that of the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
Perhaps the tsunami was stronger than expected due to the geographical location of the city, located at the end of a long narrow bay.
Nugroho called the damage “large-scale,” adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
Under the ruins of collapsed buildings, the bodies of the dead were found; a total of 540 people were injured, and another 29 are missing.
Nugroho added that the casualties and destruction could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Palu, in the town of Dungala, which was closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications with Dungal were "completely destroyed, no information was received".
“Over 300,000 people live in the Dungala area,” the International Committee of the Red Cross, whose staff and volunteers have already headed to the disaster zone, said in its communiqué.
“There has been a tragedy, but this is not the limit,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the Office was harshly criticized because it did not report the arrival of the tsunami in Palu in time. Authorities, however, believe that the waves reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
An amateur video appeared on social media, in which a man on the top floor of the building screams about an impending tsunami, desperately trying to attract the attention of people on the street.
A few minutes later, a wall of water collapses on the shore, carrying whole houses and cars with it.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authorship of this video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a large de-energization of the electrolines, which caused the communication in Palu to disappear. This made rescue operations of the services very difficult.
Military transport planes were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian aid, but the evacuated population still lacks food and essentials, government sources said.
The city’s airport has only been opened for humanitarian aid; it will be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centers in Palu will be visited by President Joko Widodo.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
The situation is very bad.
Volunteers of the charity World Vision safely arrived from Dungala in Palu, where employees found shelter in tarpaulin tents smashed in the yard of their office building. According to Dosseb Sinai, on the way to their eyes appeared a terrible picture of complete destruction.
“They saw a huge number of destroyed houses,” he says.
The situation is very bad.
Charities have begun to put in place humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that specialists from international NGOs have failed to get to Palu.
Indonesian law allows the attraction of funding, humanitarian aid and staff of foreign organizations only after declaring the place where the disaster struck a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is believed to be a local disaster,” said Aulia Ariani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government declares the natural disaster national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but for now the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that shook Palu, friends and relatives of missing people still hope for their miraculous salvation, which will restore the population's faith in the best.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued who fell into a sewer hatch.
On Sunday, rescuers pulled a woman from the rubble of the building, who spent two days there, next to her mother’s breathless body.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paragliding coach, has prepared two of the missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among the other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students, including the Mandaga.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and emotionally it’s hard to survive,” he said.
Gendon recalls how, after learning about the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel from other paragliders, during the following hours he desperately tried to contact his colleagues from Palu, resting at the beach festival, on WhatsApp.
However, his messages were displayed with one gray checkmark, rather than two blue ones.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Audacious theft of $26,750 while servicing an ATM in Newport-on-Livy
On Friday morning, the attackers stole $26,750 from the Brink’s incasso agent, who runs one of the ATMs in the city of Newport-on-Live, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
According to investigator Dennis McCarthy, the driver of the armored minibus took cash from an ATM located in the entertainment complex, and was going to fill it with new banknotes.
At this time, "an attacker ran up to a Brink's employee from behind" and stole a bag of banknotes to refuel the ATM.
According to witnesses, several suspects fled the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Yea
Rapper Kanye West has come up with a new name: Yee.
On Saturday, he tweeted: “A person formerly known as Kanye West.”
41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The news came ahead of Kanye's appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he plans to release his new album Yandhi.
Kanye West will act as co-host instead of singer Ariana, who canceled her participation due to "emotional experiences", the author of the program reports.
West has previously stated that the pseudonym is not only a shortened version of his name, but also carries a religious meaning.
“Ye is the most common word in the Bible, it means ‘you’, ‘you’,” West explained the title of his album in a recent interview with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us.
First there was Kanye, which means “one”, and now I am only Ye, that is, a reflection of all the good, bad, incomprehensible in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are.”
Kanye is not the first rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or simply Diddy, asked this year to call himself Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Brotherly Love" or "Brotherly Love").
The rapper Jay-Z, who spoke with West, also changed the spelling of his name several times: with a hyphen and without, in capital letters or in small letters.
Mexico's president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador vowed never to resort to military force against civilians on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a student demonstration that ended in a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatellolco Square, President Lopez Obrador promised “never to resort to the help of the army to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, during a peaceful demonstration of students, the first shots were fired at the crowd and a massacre began, killing 300 people. This occurred against the background of the strengthening of leftist student movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador also promised to support Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and the opening of more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of prospects for education lead young people directly into the criminal world.
U.S. needs to double funding for AI
Do not underestimate China and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) — the United States should double investment in its scientific development, said Li Kaifu, an investor and entrepreneur in the field of AI development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Earlier, statements about the work on AI were made by several US ministries, although the United States as a whole does not have a clear strategy in the field of AI development.
At the same time, China presented its own plan last year: its goal is to be the first in AI innovation by 2030.
“Increasing the budget for AI research by half would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we expect the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Increasing funding by half could double the chances that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face ++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an artificial intelligence system that outperformed the highest player in American Othello, and then he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese subsidiary Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next competition would be held to help find people with unconventional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
“It’s not China that absorbs academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been hiring lights from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States in the development of artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to AI candidates,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence of the next generation.
China’s National Endowment for Natural Sciences allocates funding to scientists in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to American researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower, Li argues.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which should involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
As for NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. law, which sought to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any action in this direction for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that has blocked its bids to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments signed an agreement based on the proposal of a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign cast doubt on whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question put to the referendum was as follows: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU, subject to the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgievskaya, a resident of Skopje.
A sufficient number of members of parliament said they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it has no binding legal force.
Changing the name will require a two-thirds majority of the members of parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that there were no reports of violations by 13:00.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Yose Tanevski, a voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on changing the country’s name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage, placing chairs in front of the tents installed by those citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with a high head, and not beating the thresholds of bureaucratic cabinets,” Kavadarkov said.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring investments in Macedonia, which is so necessary for this country, where the unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I believe that the vast majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that a positive response will be the “guarantee of our prosperous future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Studies found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, but that’s below the required turnout.
In another survey conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telecom-TV, it turned out that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote positively.
For a referendum to take place, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policies since it came to power in May last year.
Sergio Agüero of Manchester City bypasses Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Rahim Sterling broke the defense of Brighton, leading Manchester City to a 2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Agüero scored a goal in the 65th minute, it seemed that it did not make him any trouble.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentinian striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three Brighton defenders before breaking out into open space.
Agüero was surrounded by four rivals in green t-shirts.
He overtook one defender and overtook several others along the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He then handed the ball to Sterling on the left.
The English striker, while in the penalty area, in one touch returned the ball Agüero, who with his right foot pierced the goalkeeper “Brighton” Matthew Ryan in the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this game, Agüero got the ball, being deep in the territory of "Brighton"
He gave an excellent cutting gear on the left flank of Leroy Sana'a.
Sane made several touches before giving the transmission to Sterling on the long bar.
The "Heavenly Blue" striker scored the ball into the goal just before flying out of the field.
Manchester City clashed with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer is going to take away the glasses from the “Colorado Rockies”
After the Washington Nationals dropped out of the battle for the playoffs, there was no particular reason to force events.
But the tireless Scherzer hopes to take the lead in the fight against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the Rockies, ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division, have problems in the playoffs.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies have already won at least 7 or 8 places, but they still hope to secure a title in the first division.
“And while we’re playing just like that, at least we can hold our ground knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of spectators and another team, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss this?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a pitcher for Sunday, but, according to the latest data, in this situation tend to expose Scherzer to this role.
Scherzer, who is going to go to the 34th game, on Thursday threw the ball at the pitcher's pitch, and on Sunday, on his weekend, he will be a pitcher.
Washington’s right-hand pitcher statistics are 18-7 with an ERA rating of 2.53 and 300 cars in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is running a race in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections, the president indirectly referred to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, the presidential nominee for the Supreme Court.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections in our lives.
It is very, very important. I do not run, although I really run, everywhere fighting for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means are necessary, and we are witnessing filth and disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to cross to get power and control, and that’s what they want — power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he says, set out to “resist and obstruct.”
“And you’ve been watching this for the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, mean, ugly, and lying.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, mentioning Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which caused loud shouts from the hall.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to be leaked?
Mm-hmm, what document?
No, no. The body language gave it away, I've never seen the body language deny words so much."
The Labour Party is no longer an organization with different views.
She has no tolerance for those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my local party put forward a motion of no confidence in me, it wasn’t a surprise.
After all, I am the last Labour MP who has not yet been told that we are not being welcomed because we are expressing our opinion.
The same is true of my colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized by a vote of no confidence for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe – ironically, these are issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A notice on the Nottingham Eastern Labour Assembly said on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the time I spent eight years as a local Labour MP, GC’s Friday evening meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today’s tone does not correspond to those many meetings, and the promise of a “more humane and soft” policy has long been forgotten, if it ever was.
The fact that no differences of opinion are allowed in the Labour Party is becoming more and more obvious, and each opinion is evaluated on whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues whose political outlook I had previously thought was similar to my own, began to expect me to radically change my views and take positions I would never agree with — whether it was national security or the EU single market.
Every time after my public speech, no matter what I say, there is a tirade of insults on social media calling for the abolition of elections, condemning the policy of the center, or claiming that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And it doesn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments to me still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those of my colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist attacks every day, but never retreat.
What is most disappointing about this policy is that so many insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the “broad church,” and with every vote of no confidence or change of the rules of choice, the party becomes already.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations calling on me to sit quietly and sparsely speak, and then I will be fine.
But that’s not why I came into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, as a school student outraged by Thatcher’s government’s disdainful attitude, which literally disintegrated my school class, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public service for those who need it most, whether as a local deputy or as a government minister.
I never hid my political views, nor did I in the last election.
No one at Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported the vote on Friday, I would like to say the following: our country is moving so hard towards a Brexit that is guaranteed to cause economic, industrial and state damage, and I do not understand the desire of some to waste their time and energy on the question of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to address is not Nottingham Momentum, but my constituents, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of reversal of the election results or political expediency will prevent me from acting in the way that I consider necessary in your interests.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Air 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible "Air" comes in first place
Two late attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Premier League match of Tennent.
Now they head the table, the only invincible team of the dozens.
In the end, all thanks to their excellent defense, as well as the ability to choose the right moment, which gave the host team and coach Peter Murcia the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested for strength all this time, and we’re still invincible, so I have no reason to be sad,” said Mercy.
Robin Christie, Melrose: "It's worth it, Er, they did better than us."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt by Fraser Climo brought the Air forward, but a yellow card issued for the game by the Warriors allowed the Scottish player Rory Hughes to go forward, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealized attempt.
Klimot increased the distance from the penalty box before earning a point in the middle of the game, and then in a break he made a single attempt, scoring 17-5 in favor of the Air.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt by Baggot narrowed the gap to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruarid Knott, who was stretched, and after re-entry, "Er" moved on thanks to Stafford McDowell's attempt to implement Climo.
Acting Air Captain Blair McPherson then received a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced the rivals to pay another player for the unrealized attempt of Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climo without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the approaching Air Pier.
Climo realized the advantage, not stopping almost from re-entry, after Kyle Rowe received a blow from David Armstrong and sent the extreme striker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the owners of the field.
Star Still Game is going to start a new career in the restaurant business
Still Game star Ford Kieran is about to start working in the hotel industry: it became known that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, the script for which he writes, and is starring alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last in the show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official information, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, although a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kirnan was planning to take part in a “prosperous restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our Sea”: landlocked Bolivia hopes that the court will once again open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Blue flags are displayed on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are depicted with the slogan: “Our sea is right.
It is our duty to bring him back.”
Throughout landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile as a result of the bloody 19th-century conflict over resources is still alive; alive and eager to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes may have been the boldest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an international court decision to take place on October 1 as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, a spirit of unity and a mental balance and, of course, a positive result is expected here,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague will be able to support Bolivia’s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is under an obligation to negotiate for Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia’s indigenous peoples, who is fighting a difficult battle for re-election next year, is also anxiously awaiting a decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if this happens, it will not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no authority to dispose of Chilean territory and has already stated that it will not affect the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision was rendered only six months after the last arguments were heard suggests that the case “was not complicated,” says Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, the Bolivian case has not progressed, but on the contrary, it has been postponed all the time.
“The current Bolivian administration has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate says.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Morales destroyed the last Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velce, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, disagrees that the court’s decision was passed too quickly.
Monday will bring Bolivia “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit,” he says.
Calzadilla also disagrees that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, is using the naval issue as a political trump card.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he said.
“The court’s decision is an opportunity to see once again that we need to step through our past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen Until It Can Trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never destroy its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri was speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the Singapore summit among its leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gradually returns to the path of resumption of impasse nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ree argues that the dream that long-term sanctions and US objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War will ever bring the North to its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to approve the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to guarantee its security is widespread.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows show the latest line of massive hats that promise to appear in mass sales, and they will be worn right next to you
If you want to add a hat to your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun’s rays, there’s no need to look for anything else.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a mass of unusual hats, which are part of their SS19 collection and dazzling visitors to Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely impractical hats have won the popularity of Instagram followers, and designers decided to send their stunning creations to the podium.
Distinguished copy of Valentino: a beige headdress, decorated with wide fields, similar to feathers, embellished on the heads of models.
Other massive accessories included watermelons decorated with precious stones, a magician's hat and even pineapple, but all these hats are not designed to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also showed the world a collection of fancy masks, which had to be very much on the eve of Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks had a sewn mouth, and they looked more like a portrait of Hannibal Lecter than a creation from coutures.
One of the specimens resembled diving equipment with a tube and safety glasses, and the other - melted ice cream.
If you are a fan of high fashion, you are lucky.
Fashion critics predict that these huge hats have every chance of breaking into mass sales – right to you.
The huge size of the hats goes on the heels of the "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot-wide fields, which is worn by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratakovsky.
The cult label, which released this extremely impractical hat, which gained such wide popularity on social networks, gave birth to and sent another huge accessory to walk on the catwalk - a straw beach bag, almost as large as the swimsuit model herself, carrying this bag.
An orange bag made of burnt raffia with a white leather handle and edging made of raffia became a bright copy of the collection of Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 at the Fashion Week in Paris.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage tells FEMAIL: “I think big hats and beach bags will go on sale next summer. Since the designer has produced such a furor with his works, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of great importance to the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which was once again confirmed in 2018: outstanding exam results demonstrated individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other socially significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), with more than 30,000 students across Scotland, seeking to provide the highest level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen career, as well as for the status of world citizens.
As part of the educational sector that is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, you are calling to his mind.
If you speak to him in his native language, then you speak to his heart.”
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely solely on English if we want to build relationships with citizens of other countries and be able to trust them.
According to the results of the last exams this year, we see that the languages occupy a leading position in the league tables and have the highest score on the results of examinations in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students received an "A" in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German learners, 69 per cent of French learners and 63 per cent of Spanish learners also received an "A".
This proves that in independent schools in Scotland foreign languages are undoubtedly considered vital for children and young people in the future.
At present, language subjects are in the same demand as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other educational institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons that made it difficult for employers to fill vacant jobs, 17 percent had a lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming the key to a successful future career for young people.
Given that more promising jobs require language skills, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what profession the student chooses, if he learns a second language, in the future he will get a real advantage by mastering another additional skill that will be useful to him during his later life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who knows several foreign languages a competitive advantage.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage — it is spoken by 15 percent of respondents.
That’s why investing in language education is so important right now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially those of developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
There is a wide variety of languages taught in schools in Scotland – each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in light of the country’s future development by 2020 – such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always have a choice of several languages with teaching staff, whose members are specialists in these languages.
Independent schools in Scotland aim to create a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that, in the global business environment, languages continue to be vital to the country ' s future development, and this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be seen as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, providing diversity and benefits for Scotland’s youth.
Il faut bien le faire.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The horrifying expectation of fans to see LeBron James perform for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in a pre-season Sunday match against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it remains to be seen how much time he has to play.
“More than one and less than forty-eight,” Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited time.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare for the season,” he said.
Trump's race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of election meetings tonight in Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five scheduled meetings next week, including a visit to friendly Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the vote on his proposed Supreme Court candidacy has been postponed, Trump seeks to win support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the vote takes place in November.
What time will the Trump meeting take place in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willing, West Virginia, will take place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s meeting with West Virginia voters online on live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at a hearing this week to nominate his candidate Brett Kavanaugh for the post of Supreme Court Justice. Trump's proposal of this candidacy has caused a lot of negative reactions, since Kavanaugh was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote, which was supposed to take place in the Senate, will be postponed for a period of up to a week, while the FBR.
But the main goal of this action is to help Republicans going to the November elections to increase the election pace.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign aims to ensure that these five meetings, due next week, help “intensify the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president should visit as many states as possible because we are entering a tense campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The action planned today at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from “...Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports West Virginia Metro News.
Trump’s visit to West Virginia this Saturday is his second visit to the state in the past month, as it was here that he gained an advantage of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in polls.
“The fact that the president has to come before Morrissey in the polls is not a good sign for Morrissey,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates readiness for the fight and nurtures hopes, going on Sunday to the doubles competitions
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's two-on-two game may have been exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
Transitional initiative is an exceptionally invented sports concept, but it is in it that players believe, and in such competitions it is especially pronounced.
Who has the initiative?
“They had an advantage of six points and now four, so I think it’s a small initiative for us,” said Jordan Spitt leaving.
Of course, Europe has an advantage of four points, and another twelve at stake.
Americans, according to Spit, feel the “wind in the sails,” and they have reason to keep their spirits up, not least thanks to the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas playing together all day, and each boasting three out of four points.
Sleep was inflexible from you to the green, which gave a personal example.
The winning exclamations became louder as his round went on, driving the decisive ball into the hole, closing the match when he and Thomas lost two by two.
His punch, which gave them victory in the game on the 15th hole, was met with a similar cry, one of those that speak of his belief in a chance for the American team.
“We need to get together with all our strength and focus only on our game,” Spit said.
That’s all that’s left for the players.
Go through 18 holes and become the winners.
The only players who have earned more points in the last two days than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are undeniably included in the history of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming couple from Europe knocked out four out of four, and they seem to know no mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple who did not pick up the boggies on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the boggies on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and again on Friday mornings.
This series, and the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the furious fans, reinforces the belief that they will not be defeated on Sunday, and when the sun hides behind the horizon of the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous player who cemented the potential victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It would be great if they were both on different holes at the same time.
However, it is premature to talk about the glory of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dealt with Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two double boggi on the first nine holes dug a Spanish and Swede hole, from which they could not get out.
So on Sunday, no one will help you get out of your pit.
It’s so exciting to watch four-ball and four-player games because of the interactions between the pairs, the tips they exchange, and the intentionally silenced ones, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has made significant headway on the last day, but this session of the four also showed that the U.S. team has all the strength to fight, which some, especially in America, doubted.
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a tangible advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after the completion of Saturday’s four-ball and four-ball matches with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods to bring the score to Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, who wanted to regain the trophy lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the mistaken American team in the morning games in four goals, winning with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance in the fours, winning two matches, but they were unable to narrow the gap.
Jim Ferrick’s team needs eight points from 12 Sunday matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, became only the second pair to win four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in four goals, they then brilliantly teamed up to defeat the fallen Woods and American rookie Bryson Decebmo with an even more decisive 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic flashes, but now he lost 19 of 29 matches in four goals, and the four - seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting before the morning four-ball game, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the fours, beating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Capek with a score of 2/1, occupying the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game did not become an easy and pleasant walk in a refreshing day to the south-west of Paris.
Earned three-time champion Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas on Saturday, two points were the reference for the Americans.
They earned a decisive 2/1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Polter in the four-ball game and returned later to beat Polter and Rory McIlroy 4/3 in the fours, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup did the team bounce out of the four-point gap, coming out alone, given that the Ferik team, as hosts, had to play a draw to keep the trophy.
However, after two days of holding second place, Sunday’s counterattack looks like it’s beyond their means.
North Korea says it will not “categorically” unilaterally disarm without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had heightened distrust of the United States and that his country would never give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under any circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial goodwill measures” last year, such as ending nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and committing not to build up nuclear weapons or develop nuclear technology.
"However, we do not observe a symmetrical reaction from the United States," he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, we will not be able to unilaterally take the first action on disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s already-sounding grievances against Washington’s “phased” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for step-by-step steps, his statement seemed important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Pyongyang did in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the incumbent U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12; then Kim promised to start moving towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” and Trump promised North Korea security guarantees.
North Korea seeks to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists that ‘denuclearization must be done first,’ and raises the level of pressure through sanctions to enforce its goal, and even objects to the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the real problem is that the ongoing sanctions reinforce our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were on the side of this denuclearization issue, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock.”
However, Ri’s tone of speech differed sharply from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting the U.S. mainland was inevitable after “Mr. President of Evil” Trump called Kim a “suicide missile.”
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not specify any timeframe for the process: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyongyang for the steps that have been taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and necessarily until we see complete, definitive and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, seeking to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly summit and said after that meeting that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying progress had been made, but within hours of that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandit demands.”
North Korea has promised to dismantle the missile system as well as the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures” at a Moon-participated meeting this month.
According to him, Kim told him that the “relevant measures” he was talking about were the security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn to relax in special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, has helped all entry-level students learn to sleep more and fight the chauvinist culture of uninterrupted caffeine consumption with the goal of waking up “overnight.”
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After his discovery, he lit up with the idea of introducing such a course, having previously presented a report on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning processes.
“At the end of my talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘It’s a pity I only found out about this now that I’m almost finishing my studies.’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first offered to students this year, talks about how a healthy sleep habit contributes to academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves a person’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s Health Service, says the university has decided to introduce this course after it was found that students experience a severe lack of sleep during the school week.
The class lasts one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
One section of the class offers an image of a dorm room where students, by clicking on coffee cups, curtains, simulators, and books, get information about how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, which causes lack of sleep — affect sports performance, and how important it is to get enough sleep every day.
In another section, participants learn how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map encourages course participants to reflect on their daily lives.
“We understand that these classes will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have a right to know, like any other person has a right to know, for example, how smoking affects their health,” Chaisler added.
According to him, the false sense of pride that a person can “smell all night” is still quite common, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
A sufficient amount of good quality sleep is the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to combat excess weight, he said, as lack of sleep puts the brain into starvation mode, making it constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course by attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all postgraduates to complete a similar study program before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chaisler recommends that students install an alarm clock that warns them to go to bed and wake up, as well as remembering the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps, which disrupts the human biorhythm and leads to problems with falling asleep.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": Goal Menga brings victory over the team Gerrard
The Rangers survived another sad away meeting, as Dolly Meng’s goal led the undefeated team of Steven Gerrard to a 1-0 loss in Livingstone.
Ibrox's team had hoped to win their first away victory after a 4-1 win in St. John's in February, but Gary Holt's team only inflicted a second defeat on Gerrard out of 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind, giving an easy victory to the Harts, the Scottish Premier League's leaders.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost their spirits, did not seem to be about to settle the score.
While the Rangers now dropped to sixth place, the Livingstone climbed to third place, and only Hibernian lost in the goal-scoring ratio.
And the Rangers may have additional problems after linear judge Kalum Spence had to heal a wound on his head after some item was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerrard made eight substitutes in the team that passed through the Air to the semi-finals for the Scottish League Cup.
Holt, in turn, went with the same Livy 11 strategy, which increased the gap with the Harts last week, and he would be happy to see how his well-trained squad squeezed opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have led the way in sword possession, but the Livingstones squeezed much more when the ball hit them.
They were supposed to score a goal in just two minutes, when the first transfer of Meng to Scott Pittman was stopped by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder took the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs took a penalty kick against team captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Litgow, only managed to send the ball towards the far bar.
The Rangers took control, but the last third seemed to have more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was sure he was supposed to hit the penalty kick in the forty-fifth minute when he and Steven Lawless clashed, but Judge Steven Thomson disagreed with the Colombian's statement.
The Rangers made only two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was hardly concerned about Lassan Coulibaly's head kick, and Ovi Ejaria's weak kick.
Although Livy’s first goal in the 34th minute may not have matched the game, no one can deny that they deserved it solely by their own efforts.
But again, the Rangers failed to cope with the game of Jacobs from the standard position.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave the ball to Scott Robinson, who tried his best to hand the ball over to Meng for completion.
Gerrard began to act in a break when he traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and such a replacement almost immediately gave the result when the extreme midfielder gave a pass to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced from his line to intercept.
But Livingston continued to draw guests into their intended game with Litgow and Halkett, constantly making long shows.
Holt's team tried to increase the gap in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs before Litgow gave the transmission from the corner of the field.
Rangers reserve player Glenn Middleton once again demanded a penalty kick after he clashed with Jacobs, but Thomson again refused.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day in Germany was born future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Becoming one of the foundations of science, the Geiger counter has also become one of the foundations of popular culture, and this is reflected in the 1950s film "The Coronado Bell", with cowboy-like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans - seemingly unlike scientists - in the lead roles:
Man: “What kind of thing is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms generated by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: "Here, now you can hear it!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, not living just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Abnormal Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” abnormally growing cells and kill them
Part of the therapeutic effect of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to recognize abnormal cells
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and their change in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, the cells get the ability to "see" the type of protein that is characteristic of many cancers, then the cells must be re-leaded.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In one patient who was given this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize abnormal cells, ovarian cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract the immune cells from the patient and change them in the laboratory, after which the modified cells can "see" the HER2 protein characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are re-injected to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, National Cancer Research Institute, Wyfezda, Maryland, says: “The results we’ve obtained suggest we’ve got a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
A similar method was successfully applied in the treatment of leukemia. It consisted in the collection of immune cells in patients and their "training" how to act on cancer cells.
Kanye West defended Trump in a MAGA cap after appearing in SNL.
It went bad.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during a Saturday concert in which he spoke out in defense of U.S. President Donald Trump, claiming that he would retake the post in 2020.
After performing his third song titled “Ghost City,” which he wore the cap “Make America Great Again,” the singer delivered a speech against the Democrats and supported Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they ask me, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL made a parody show with Matt Damon in the lead role, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christina Blacy Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
It was not shown on television how the crowd was outraged by West's statement, but this video was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not clear now whether Rock tried to ridicule West with this step.
In addition, West complained to the public that his hat was ridiculed behind the scenes.
“They were playing me behind the scenes.
They say don't come out in that hat.
They were really messing with me!
The Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, “They also said my position is not cool.”
West continues: “Do you want to know what’s not cool? Wear a superman’s cloak so that no one can tell you what to do. Do you want the world to continue to evolve?
Then you need love.”
His comments caught the attention of the audience at least twice, the cast of SNL seemed confused, and one person told the publication: “The whole studio has plunged into silence.”
West was invited at the last minute as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
Many were puzzled by West's performance of the song "I Love it" in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of TPUSA’s conservative head, Candice Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING A LOT.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just “who he is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I don’t want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothes or otherwise supporting his work) who, in my opinion, shares and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she said.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffie and P. Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snoop Dogg, originally had the name Snoop Lyon, and as another example, one can, of course, take the performer, who recently became a legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol, and then to the name of the artist formerly known as "Prince".
Attempted Murder Charges Due to Slaughter at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after one of his visitors died of stab wounds at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhakamar, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Peace Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the State Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Keith Harrington attacks toxic masculinity
Keith Harrington is known for his role as the sword-waving John Snow in HBO's brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, recently, the 31-year-old actor vehemently criticized the macho hero’s stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people with the idea that in order to be respected, one must necessarily be cruel.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believed "something went wrong" and wondered how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, has admitted that he is “very indifferent” to the problem.
“Personally, I take this question quite seriously: where did we go wrong with the perception of masculinity?” asks the actor.
“What do we teach adolescents that we have such a problem today?”
Keith believes that television may be partly to blame for this surge of toxic masculinity because of the overly muscular characters.
The actor continues: “What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young men feel that they should show only one certain side of masculinity?
I think this is really one of the biggest problems of our time, and the question is how can we change that?
Because today with young people, really, something is wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequels or sequels of “Game of Thrones” after the series ends next summer, saying that he had “ended battles and horses.”
Starting in November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's new True West, which tells the story of the film's producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently announced that he believes that meeting his wife Rose is the best Game of Thrones finale for him.
“I met my wife on this show, so he gave me my family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Igraist, the subject of the passion of the character of Keith John Snow in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple celebrated their wedding in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of its citizens infected with HIV and AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people in the country suffer from these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease was sexually transmitted, which indicates a change in the trends of the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of transfusions of infected blood.
However, the number of HIV infections in this way was practically reduced to zero, said representatives of Chinese health at a conference in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
Studies confirm that because of the country’s conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
In many cases, transmission is caused by insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators, complaining about “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory”
U.S. House of Representatives Maxine Waters on Saturday rejected accusations that one of her employees posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on lawmakers’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims the lawsuits were forged by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more deceitful lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators. Lindsay Graham, Southern California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Utah.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing over allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the messages was linked to Waters’ office, and released information about Waters’ employees, Hill reports.
“This unfounded claim is absolutely false,” Waters said.
“A member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent activities was in no way responsible for the leakage of this information.
This unfounded assertion is a complete lie.”
Waters’ statement immediately drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This is an angry denial,” Fleisher writes.
“This means that the author has a temperament that is not suitable for working in Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why be angry?
There is no need to justify either.
Nor should the motives of the prosecutors be explored.
You have to stay calm and cold.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee running for Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s important,” he writes.
In a statement, Waters said her office had warned “the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent activities.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are found,” she writes, “and that they are legally responsible for all their actions, which can be devastating and dangerous to all and every one of my employees.”
Johnny English strikes again - a weak parody of spy Rowan Atkinson
Today, it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of Brexit in any new film in which the United Kingdom appears in one way or another; this also applies to the new parody spy franchise “Agent Johnny English”, the production of which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with the film “Agent Johnny English: Reboot”.
Will the self-ironic leitmotif “obvious that we’re all shit” become a new attempt at national exports?
In any case, the light-eyed profan Johnny English with a rubber face got his right to chaos for the second time - his name most vividly hints at the fact that it is a wide-screen comic creation intended for a non-English cinematic audience.
The hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims on the glamorous smoothie, received a bit of Clouseau, features Mr. Bean and a portion of this guy who made a single note to the tune of Chariots of Fire in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the mysterious "international" Atkinson, once played in the now forgotten television commercial Barclaycard, in which the hero leaves behind complete chaos.
In this last issue of JE there are one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the blades crawled on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates Atkinson's gift for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but humor itself seems rather weak and oddly redundant, especially because such "serious" film rehearsals as "Agent 007" and "Mission Impossible" now confidently offer comedy as an element.
It feels like humor is meant for kids, not adults, and for me Johnny English’s bizarre misfortunes are not as inventive and relevant as Atkinson’s jokes in Mr. Bean’s films.
The constant message now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker penetrated the top-secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the duty agent - Kevin Eldon here, unfortunately, got an episodic role.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, a pompous and assertive figure already suffering from enormous political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the quasi-Theresa May character, but there is nothing to work with in the script.
Her intelligence advisers tell her that since every active spy has been compromised, she will have to pull someone out of retirement.
And here comes the clumsy Johnny English himself, who now works as a school teacher in some pontifical institution, but also gives unofficial lessons of secret operational work: there are some good jokes here, as English offers the skills of a spy academy in the style of "rock".
English returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunites with his former unlucky friend Buff, who is played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now a married man, obeying the commander of the submarine - the role of "fun hockey sticks", in which Vicky Pepperdin is a little lost.
So, Batman and Robin are back in the game because of the terrible mistakes in Her Majesty's Secret Service. They are faced with a beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova performed by Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister dangerously falls under the spell of a charismatic technology billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems – the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff begin their odyssey of farce jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos by smuggling themselves on the luxury yacht Volta; English generates complete anarchy, trying to use a virtual reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Volta's home.
All these scenes, of course, are cute and funny fiction, but in all this there is something quite childish.
Totally moderate things.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that’s really commensurate with his talent?
Labour denies they are developing a plan to reduce the working week of the British people to four days for a five-day salary
Labour's Jeremy Corbyn is going to consider a radical plan under which the British will work four days a week but get paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants company executives to give workers the savings generated by the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
Sources reported that the idea “fits” into the economic agenda of the party and will help the population of the country to take the side of the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day working week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is our goal, which is consistent with the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in favor of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this aspiration is currently not endorsed by the majority of the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to concretize his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to seize power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” of utility firms.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current water canal shareholders may not get their full share back, as the Labour government may make “deductions” on the basis of alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to include workers in the boards of directors of companies and create Inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of private sector firms to workers who will be able to receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham and John F. Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation into the charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment as Supreme Court Justice for at least a week and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could prompt any Republican senators to support Kavanaugh.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham to see if the FBI could find anything to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy replied.
“When I went to the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, this information popped up, I asked, “Did you do this?”
His response was decisive, definite and unambiguous.”
But Graham's vote remained unwavering.
“I am firmly committed to Brett Kavanaugh, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments comparable in strength to dynamite,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but one thing I know for sure is that Brett has resolutely denied it all,” Graham said.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
This story is 36 years old.
I didn’t see anything new in it.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring an impressive star cast with an equally impressive mission to end poverty worldwide.
For the seventh year of the World Citizens Festival, tens of thousands of people flock to the large lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to talk about the real goal of the event: the eradication of extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens Festival, which opened in 2012, is a continuation of a global anti-poverty project run by an international group of human rights defenders hoping to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free event ticket (if you’re not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), you had to volunteer or send an email to a world leader, make a phone call, or perform any other or other meaningful action aimed at helping raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Festival of Citizens of the World been in 12 years in terms of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really convincing their fellow citizens to demand a call to action, or is it just another case of so-called “clickivism” when people believe they are making real changes by signing an online petition or sending messages on Twitter?
Organizers of Global Citizen claim that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” held by its supporters have been registered at the festival, which pursue many different goals.
It is mentioned that thanks to these actions, world leaders promised to allocate more than $ 37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group announced 390 commitments and announcements that were made as a result of its actions, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimated that the funds provided direct assistance to nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the most significant commitments is called The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementation professionals committed to “helping children fully unlock their potential” promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district. This was done after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens participants.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can make a social injustice about malnutrition a past history,” said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracy Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to call for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving nutrition.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival’s website, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The organizers of Global Citizen respond: “It will be a long and difficult journey, on which we will stumble and fall from time to time.
But as in the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monet - these are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, and its hosts will be Deborra-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy to Block Russian Energy Exports: Interior Minister
U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said Washington could “recourse to its navy if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that Russia’s presence in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason they’re in the Middle East is because they want to trade in energy the same way they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe,” he says.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the ability to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, a blockade so that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He then compares Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less efficient use and replacement of fuel,” the minister says, calling Russia a “one-trick pony” whose economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration set out to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which offers a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 project, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I stress that we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the face of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third country intervenes in our energy supplies, it poses a serious problem,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will carefully study the possibility of running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would carefully consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting of the city council in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider participating in the election race.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that’s what a woman needs,” says Warren The Hill.
“After November 6, I will carefully consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren said President Donald Trump’s actions during the meeting were “leading this district in the wrong direction.”
“I’m deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an outspoken critic of both Trump himself and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, a poll published Thursday showed that most voters in Warren don’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Center for Political Studies, 58 percent of “probable” Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The poll showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 percent supported his possible participation in the elections, and 48 percent opposed.
Other well-known Democratic names that have been debated in connection with the 2020 prospect include former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Biden says he will make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin spoke about the post-traumatic stress disorder Trak Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, enlisted in the army in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son, who has returned home, is now going through the same thing as other families who are suffering from PTSD and have been injured, and our soldiers are coming back with injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "an eyewitness" and said of her son and other war veterans: "They are coming back already by others, hardened, wondering whether the same respect is shown to their comrades, soldiers, pilots and any other military that they have shown to their country."
Trak Palin was arrested on Monday in Vassil, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering with the violence and possession of weapons in a state of alcohol intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Vassil's police department.
18 states, District of Columbia, support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that bans asylum for victims of fleeing or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district filed an analytical memo in Washington on Friday from a court adviser on the support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civilian husband “and his sons, who are part of a criminal group,” abused her, but on July 20, U.S. officials rejected her asylum request.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace say El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are filing large numbers of asylum applications in the U.S. as countries facing widespread problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of application of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a ban violates this principle,” the court adviser said in a statement.
Lawyers also argue that policies banning immigrants are hurting the U.S. economy, stressing that it is this category of citizens who are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic or gang violence.
“Asylum will be granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political beliefs,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
This tool was never intended to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Palu: death toll doubles in search of survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more difficult.
“It is very difficult now,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her sick baby in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings the wounded.
“Clean water is scarce.”
Residents return to their destroyed homes, dig through wet things and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals affected by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwee Harris, who had a fractured spine and shoulder, were resting near Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors because they were forced to leave the room due to ongoing strong shocks.
He cries as he remembers how a powerful earthquake destroyed a hotel room on the fifth floor, which he was filming with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the debris of the wall,” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family came to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they’re safe and they’re all right now.”
US Ambassador accuses China of “attacks” carried out through “propaganda advertising”
A week after one of China’s official newspapers published a four-page advertisement in a daily American publication about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper in Iowa, making accusations against China in an attempt to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections that will be held on November 6. This accusation China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election is a confirmation of the fact that U.S. officials told Reuters: a new stage in Washington’s intensifying campaign to put pressure on China is coming.
While it is the norm for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, resulting in them equating tariffs on their countries’ imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, says Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an article published in the Sunday magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and free press, paying for and advertising in the Des Moines Register,” writes Branstad.
“However, in the newsstands here on the streets of Beijing, you are unlikely to hear dissenting voices and not see the true diversity of opinions that the Chinese could learn about China’s alarming economic policy, because the local media are under the tight control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of the most famous Chinese newspapers "smartly renounced" the offer to publish his article, although he did not give the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: Kavanaugh spread Republicans repel women voters on the eve of the interim period
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to stand aside and defend the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially from women, that may affect the upcoming midterm elections.
Emotions around the situation have flared to the extreme, and a majority of Republicans have officially declared that they want to continue voting.
You can’t go back to these things later,” writes Grant Riere, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, in an article published on Saturday.
Rier doubts that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last-minute FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday. They will not forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn to Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November ahead!” in front of the Senate when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacy Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond,” political scientist Stu Rotenberg said on the news site.
“People say that the situation has already been heated up enough, and it’s true.
But things can get worse, especially in terms of suburban female voters and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford publicly testified against the Supreme Court nominee, accusing him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed the nomination, the move could trigger a retaliatory response.
“This is already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about voting on the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh sat on the defendants’ bench, but how Republicans deal with it, how they treat it,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
Still, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on the question of who to trust – Ford or Kavanaugh, and a little more leaning towards the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony accurately or most likely, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh accurately or most likely.
In addition, 38 percent believe Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lying at the time of his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
At Flake’s insistence, the FBI is currently investigating allegations filed by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath in the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh, intoxicated, assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the post of Supreme Court Justice showed her her genitals at a party while studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people to give access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s goal was to gain “world domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he says of his startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, cases, as well as a calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools for working with data.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify - everything can be used in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal online data storage is that it is fully managed by the user, who can access any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “personal empowerment through data.”
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company has provided the resources, processes and related skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several full-time developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not in talks with Facebook and Google about whether his company should make drastic changes that will change all of their business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a Medium post published on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee’s voice has been quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Churchman awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I, and this event was celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on September 29, 1918 for his participation in the attack on Bellenglise and Leeuwarden.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had received the highest British military award.
A monument to this event was solemnly unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “very symbolic” that the monument was opened exactly 100 years after his grandfather received the award.
According to the London Gazette of September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vanne conducted his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin “in very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.”
Later, he rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led the group forward, and then with one hand threw the field gun, knocking down three soldiers of the unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
The 72-year-old grandson of the hero, Michael Vann, said that "he would hardly have been able to do the same heroically, but it humiliates."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath at the end of the parade, which was led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra Brentwood.
Michael Vann said it was "a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the valor of a true hero is confirmed by the support that will be given by many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they were shown Peppa’s pig
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the full Bellator 206, but you weren’t allowed to see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 fights, including six of the main program, the fights were broadcast all night live on Channel 5 of British television.
At 6 a.m., when Geghard Moussasi and Rory McDonald were preparing for the meeting, fans of the UK were stunned to see Peppa Pig on screens.
Some fans were not impressed at all, because they did not sleep until the morning just to watch the fights.
One Twitter fan called the change to the children’s cartoon “some sort of sick joke.”
“There was a government order that at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications when asked why.
"Yes, Peppa Pig."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they plan to schedule the battles in a way that future British spectators can also watch.
“As for re-showing, I think we can solve this issue,” Cocker says.
“But there is a Sunday, six o’clock in the morning, and we will not be able to solve this issue until Sunday at our own time, and for them it will already be Monday.
But we will do our best.
Believe me, when the broadcast was changed, there was a lot of text messages, and they were all far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem immediately, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
It turned out that no, it was a matter of national importance.
I promise you this won’t happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for the fans we try to increase that number, but it turned out to be too much.
Yeah, it didn’t work out well.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly had a feeling of inferiority because of his sexual orientation
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up feeling worse than anyone because of his sexuality, but that’s what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he did not understand that “not everyone is like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking on the first program of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, led by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that winning the Olympics began to worry him less after he had a child.
Permanent host of the long-term show Kirsty Young due to illness took a vacation for several months.
Daly, who played the lead guest on Laverne's program, said he felt "more insignificant than any of his peers" because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable to society, both for boys and girls.
He says: “Until today, these feelings of insignificance and inappropriateness were quite real, but they gave me strength and I was able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “meaning something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they eventually learn about his sexual orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist became a prominent LGBT activist and at his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he expressed his opinion because he was lucky to be able to live an open life without consequences, and wanted to give others “hope”.
The three-time world champion said his feelings for the man, American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “have caught him by surprise.”
Last year, Daly married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him, but claims that age difference was never a problem.
“If so much happens in your life at such a young age,” he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14, and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find a peer who would have had the same radically opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said that "all of his worldview" had changed.
“If you asked me last year, it would be all about ‘I need to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“But you know what, there are things that are more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daly said his father did not want to put up with the fact that he was dying, and one of his last requests was for first-row tickets to the London 2012 competition.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you won’t be around then, and you won’t be able to sit there in the front row,’” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only when he actually stopped breathing that I finally realized he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew it was something I’d dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympics, there was no better feeling,” he says.
It also inspired him to choose his first favorite song – Proud by Heather Small – which helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes him so much.

Michelson, who is not in shape, spent this Saturday Ryder Cup on the bench
American Phil Michelson will set a record on Sunday, playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to tighten his uniform to avoid an unpleasant milestone.
Michelson, who played at the biennial for the record 12th time, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furrick on Saturday for four goals and fours.
Instead of being at the center of events, as has often been the case in the United States, the five-time big winner divided his day between watching the game and working on his own game on the field in hopes of fixing what was troubling him.
Never having the most direct shot, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete is not an ideal candidate for the hard track Le Golf National, where a long rift usually punishes for inaccurate shots.
And if the course itself isn’t scary enough, Michelson will meet the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth match on Sunday, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who lost four points in 12 singles matches, make a bright start, the match of Michelson can be decisive.
Ferik expressed confidence in his partner, though, what else he could say.
“He fully understood the role that was assigned to him today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Ferik said.
“He’s pretty confident in himself.
He’s a walking Hall of Fame, and he’s done so much for these teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn’t expect him to play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it was so, and that's the way we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone.”
On Sunday, Michelson will beat the record of Nick Foldo in the number of games in the Ryder Cup.
This could mark the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Michelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Ferik said his presence has brought the team considerable benefit.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to belittle people, and he's a great guy to be interested in," he said.
“I think the young players had fun with him this week and it was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the great advantage may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from his experience that a significant singles lead in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unfavorable side.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Walderram, where the team led by Severiano Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only slightly ahead with the slightest difference, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big advantage in Walderram; we had a big advantage in Brooklyn where we lost, and in Walderram where we won, but only so far,” said Björn, captured in the photo yesterday, after watching the 2018 Class, winning the 10th and the 5th respectively.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will be full.
Go and do the right thing.
As long as there are no glasses on the board - nothing is over.
We have a goal, and this is a chance to win the trophy, and that’s what we need to focus on.
"I have spoken without hesitation, focusing on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that what we are up against is against the greatest players in the world."
Satisfied with the way his players played on an inconvenient golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I would never surpass myself in that.
Tomorrow we will have another test.
Tomorrow, the individual performances begin, and this is a completely different matter.
It’s always nice to be around a partner when things are going well, but when you’re left there alone, you’re testing all your strengths as a professional golfer.
It is this idea that the players need to be inspired, so that tomorrow they themselves will be fully exposed.
Now the partner is left behind, and he, too, must make every effort.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Ferrick, believes that individually his players will perform better than with partners, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Ferik himself has gone through all this carousel of recent days, becoming part of the winning team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe held the Miracle in Medina.
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, brought his players together before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as quickly as possible, as in Brooklyn, as in Medina.
When the initiative moves in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We've built our game plan accordingly and set the guys up the way we thought it was right, you know? Tomorrow we'll try to do a miracle."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the resistance by meeting Rory McIlroy in the top match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the standings.
“I’ve chosen that kind of group of guys, and in that order, because I think that’s how they’re going to cover all the possible flaws,” Björn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
The commissioning of a new German warship has been postponed
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War-era warships, but it will not happen at least next year due to faulty systems and avalanche-like cost increases, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reports, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
As far as we know, they will have a powerful gun, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some “stealth” technologies – such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the constant postponement of commissioning means that the most modern warships, which are said to allow Germany to spread its power abroad, will become obsolete by the time they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned the ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless when used in combat.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg class vessels would be operated by a crew of approximately 120 sailors – only half the manpower on the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship is too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to implement updates in the future.
It is believed that the 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice as heavy as the ships of the same class, which were used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project, including team training, also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of anchoring the newest frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings about the reduction of German naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee of the German parliament, admitted that the navy is in fact “ending the stockpile of ships capable of deployment”.
The official said the problem had worsened over time because the old ships had been decommissioned, but no replacement vessels had been provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could ever be taken into service by the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted at a Scottish Highlands estate, aims to show how bats use the landscape in search of food.
It is to be hoped that the data obtained will allow a new look at the behavior of unique winged mammals and will help in the further conservation of the species.
The study, organized by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland, will study common bats, soprano bats, as well as brown long-haired bats and Dobanton nocturnals inhabiting Inverewe Gardens, Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be installed at some points around the site to monitor the activity of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of screams, as well as the activities for which different groups of these animals are responsible.
Then a habitat map will be drawn up and a report prepared to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes these results will show which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help identify the main areas of habitat management work, such as the formation of meadows, as well as ways to maintain forest areas in a state optimal for bats and other related species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk of extinction due to construction and development works that affect their habitat and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can pose hazards, as well as duct tape for flies, chemical treatment of building materials and hunting domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, their night hunting habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo-location techniques to pinpoint obstacles on the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land nationwide, takes bat populations very seriously.
The organization employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, field inspections, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reservation at the Threate estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten species of Scottish bats.
Real estate manager David Thompson says the property is the perfect area for them.
“Here at Threate, a great place for bats,” he says.
“There are old buildings here, lots of old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But much about bats remains unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need for a successful existence.”
It recalls the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance within private possessions, since unintentionally destroying one nest can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young individuals, and possibly even the destruction of the entire local population.
Bats are protected by law, their destruction, harassment or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish bat conservation officer, calls on the public to help.
She says, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we just don’t know how their many separate species live.”
Ronaldo denies accusations of rape, and his lawyers are going to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo denies allegations of rape against him, calling them “fake news,” and claiming that people simply “want to propagate” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine “Spiegel”, which published accusations against the footballer.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, who allegedly took place in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to talk about the incident, the Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a video on Instagram, in which the footballer has 142 million followers, a few hours after the allegations, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the information “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is all fake news, according to the five-time Ballon d’Or winner on camera.
“They just want to use my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that’s just part of their job.
I am a happy person, and everything is fine for me,” adds the athlete with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Spiegel for charges they called “inadmissible information about privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz stated that the player intends to claim compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the legal violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly occurred in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in anal form, according to documents filed with Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on her knees in front of her and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy, but failed by one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she turned to the police, and the hospital took pictures of her injuries, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt “fear of being avenged” and feared “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to change her place of residence as she continues to experience the traumatic feelings inflicted by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he switched to Italian giants Juve in a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “regret automakers lost forever”
Business and entrepreneurship minister Greg Clark said the UK would “regret it forever” if it lost its status as a global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He also commented on the information that Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, it will temporarily stop production at its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” says Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could result in job losses.
The plant in Bernaston produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, and last year it produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s managing director in Bernaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini production plant in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, according to automakers, in the absence of a deal within the Brexit supply chain will be put at great risk.
Toyota’s production line is launched “just in time” and parts for custom-made cars are delivered by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the border that industry officials say could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to store stocks at its plant in Derbyshire for longer than one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan, voiced in the Checkers, for a future relationship with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
“We need a deal. We want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to achieve success at the present time, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future,” he said on the air of the BBC Radio 4 program “Today”.
“Not only Toyota, but also other manufacturers claim that we must be absolutely able to continue successful supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to specify how long production will stop, but in the longer term warned that the additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Cuvallaris, who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years and is the head of the factory’s trade union, says the concern among members is growing: “In my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will not be able to get them back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have developed an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed for another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s election meddling, ties between Trump’s aides and Russia, and potential impediments to the president’s justice.
Whether Trump will dismiss the deputy attorney general, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been a source of speculation in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denies this information.
But on Monday, he went to the White House allegedly to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer not" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, at which Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christina Blacy Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation into FBI complaints about Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, spoke on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about a meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “The date of this meeting has not yet been set, perhaps this week, and perhaps it will be postponed for another week, taking into account all other events taking place in the Supreme Court.”
But we’ll see, and I always prefer to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists dispute this claim: Sanders hasn’t held a White House briefing since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of briefings isn’t caused by the TV reporters’ “scorn for the community,” although she added, “I won’t deny they’re playing in public.”
She suggested increasing the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The president holds more meetings answering journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, without citing exact figures: “We have those numbers.”
Sanders assured that the briefings would still take place, but “if the press has the ability to directly ask questions to the President of the United States, it’s much better than talking to me.”
We try to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we’ve had over the past few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it’s a worthy replacement for press briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions by leaving the White House, participating in open meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Conferences exclusively for the press are a rarity.
The president’s frivolous and sometimes bizarre behavior in front of assembled journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why this is the case.
Health Minister addresses EU workers in Scotland with letter on Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health has appealed to EU staff working at the Scottish GHS to express gratitude on behalf of the entire country and to wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gene Freeman, an MSP, addressed this letter to employees less than six months before Britain’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to cover the cost of filing status applications for EU citizens working in their public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued, and this autumn the expected decision should be made.
However, the UK government is also stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very worrisome time for all of you.
That is why, right now, I want to emphasize once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
“Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery for head injury
The Tennessee-based Michael Organ reported that Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Abercrombie had undergone an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday after losing 31–27 in a match with the Wanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury was received shortly before the break.
“He went out to the side line and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting it on a stretcher and carrying it to a medical examination.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet about the type/degree of the injury,” and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
For Abercrombie, who had just entered the second year, it was the first season with Tennessee State since moving out of Illinois.
On Saturday, before leaving the game, he successfully intercepted five goals, which totaled 18 goals per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK.
Under Tory’s new plans, foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the additional cash raised will be used to help the homeless.
The move will nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters.

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when buying real estate in the UK, and the proceeds of additional money will be used to help the homeless - this will be announced today by Theresa May.
The move will nullify Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters who promise to make housing more affordable and raise citizens’ incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, and the additional funds raised in this way should stimulate the government's efforts to help homeless citizens.
The surcharge to the existing stamp duty, including the increase introduced two years ago for the purchase of secondary housing and rental housing, can be up to 3%.
The Treasury expects the move to make up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of new London properties are bought by non-British residents, which leads to higher prices and makes it more difficult for buyers buying their first home to improve their living conditions later on.
Many elite areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who, having bought housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of bullying property prices by buying land, but not actually using it, and urged Ms May to abandon affordable housing quotas to remedy Britain’s “disgraceful housing situation.”
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rent control and an end to unreasonable evictions.
He also wants to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year, I said that I dedicated my premiership to fulfilling the British dream of making life better with each new generation.
This means, among other things, solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-UK citizens, as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as affordable as it is for hardworking British people.
For too many people, the dream of buying their own home has become too far away, and the threat to some to be on the street is too real.
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland”
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
The 42-year-old enjoys the resurgence of the Northeastern club, which currently ranks third in the first league, separating from the championship by three points.
This summer, he moved to Stadium of Light after returning St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a B cap, that’s all,” Ross told Sportsound BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland with my father as a child in Hampden, and it always attracted me back.
However, this opportunity will only arise if I can become a successful manager of the club.”
Ross' predecessors, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Aloa Athletic says he hasn’t felt shy about such authoritative names at such large clubs, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at the moment will depend on whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
By its structure and capabilities, this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League,” says the coach.
“Bringing him out there is not an easy task, but I will assume that I have done my job only if I can bring the club back.”
Ross worked as a manager for just three years, first as an assistant manager at Dumbarton, then spent 15 months at Hearts' coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa rise from the third level and the following season brought St Mirren from the bottom positions to the championship winners.
Ross says he feels more comfortable today than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“Probably it was a real crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work at Aloa.
“I truly believed that management was better for me than the game.
It sounds strange because I did everything well, earned a lot of money in this position and achieved some success.
But the game is more difficult.
There are a lot of things to do weekly.
I still feel stress at work, but I feel good as a manager.
I’ve always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water throughout my adult life.”

According to the survey results, 17:30 is the ideal time for a pint of beer
The summer heat led to increased sales of British pubs, but lowered sales in restaurant chains.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7%, and in restaurants fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultancy that received the statistics, said: “Long solar activity, as well as longer than expected participation of England in the World Cup, means that July continued the trend the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8%, and in restaurants, on the contrary, significantly decreased.”
The June fall in restaurant trade revenues by 1.8% also continued in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol showed much higher results comparable in restaurants.
Pubs selling only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, though not as much as restaurants.
It feels like people want to jump out of the street just to miss a drink.
Beverage sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month and food sales by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the non-residential market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant chains continue to experience difficulties, especially as the 4.8 percent year-on-year drop in sales will be particularly painful due to the continuing price pressures.
A long hot summer has never been better for operators working with food, and it is not yet the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will give much-needed respite.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand rollouts.

One in five children has secret social media accounts they hide from their parents.
According to the survey, one in five children – some as young as 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of “fake insta” pages
The news has heightened concerns about sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “basic” account that parents know about
However, one in five children – some as young as 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake accounts “insta” — i.e. Instagram, a site for sharing photos.
This news has heightened concerns about sexual content publications.
Twenty percent of students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also had secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally gained access to her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account, came across a teenager who urged others to “rape him.”
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent School Directors (HMC) found that 40 percent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two social media profiles, with half of them admitting that one of them is generally secret.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “Many teens are looking to create online spaces inaccessible to their parents and teachers, and that’s an alarming fact.”
Eileed Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” of Scottish athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Eilid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a supervisory member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most titled athlete in athletics. Chairman Ian Beatty argues that this step is a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to take advantage of the extensive experience of the athlete internationally over the past decade.
“Ailede is highly respected in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that her participation will bring great benefits to athletics in Scotland,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: “I’m committed to being the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can really make a good contribution and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has a total of four Olympic gold medals, and now works as a regular commentator on the BBC, after suffering a stroke, lost the ability to walk.
He tweeted: “A month ago I had a stroke.
I have lost the ability to move.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover, and if so, to what extent.
It was exhausting work, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am doing agility exercises!
Thank you so much for your support!”
Advertising milk sucker, in which lactating mothers were compared with cows, divided the opinions of Internet users
A milk-sucking company has sparked controversy on the Internet by posting an advertisement that compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
Launching what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast-wearing milk sucker,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional music video demonstrating the freedom that the new milk sucker gives breastfeeding mothers.
Four real moms dance in a haystack to a music track that says, “Yes, I feed my own milk, but you won’t see my tail” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not a udder, it’s my breast.”
And then the chorus: "We drain, drain, we feed our babies with breast milk, drain, drain."
This ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the Internet.
77,000 views and hundreds of comments: The video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It’s a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them within a few days of birth,” one user wrote.
The Elvie milk pump is dressed directly under a special bra (Elvie/Mother)
“It is clear that this is equally traumatic for both mothers and children.
But yes, why not use them to advertise milk suckers for mothers who keep their children?”
Another user adds, “Advertising is detached from reality.”
Others, on the contrary, defended the video, and one woman even wrote that the song “just great”.
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I had a baby, I would have bought one.
Breastfeeding actually made me feel like a cow.
Advertisements are a bit crazy, of course, but that’s how it feels.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
And another comment: "Funny advertising designed for moms who breastfeed (often they do it right at their workplaces or in the toilets) and who, indeed, feel a little bit "cows."
This ad is not to praise or scold our dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with these imperceptible milk suckers hidden under bras.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breastfeeding women say they feel like cows.
In fact, the Elvie milk pump is completely imperceptible, has no wires or tubes, freely fits into a feeding bra, and at the same time is invisible, giving women the opportunity to move around, keep babies babies and even go outside during feeding.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and early childhood specialist, commented: “Elvie’s milk pump is so revolutionary that it deserves bold and provocative advertising.
Drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we wanted to bring breastfeeding and all its problems into the spotlight, while demonstrating in a humorous and fun way the incredible sense of freedom that the new milk suckling gives.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s milk sucker has hit the headlines.
During the London fashion week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk of designer Marta Yakubovsk<0xC3><0xA1>, using this product for its intended purpose.
Hundreds of migrant children move to tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because harsh rhetoric and policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it difficult to accommodate children with guarantors.
Usually, most sponsors are themselves undocumented immigrants and are afraid to jeopardize their stay in the country by taking a child under the guarantor.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential guarantors and other adult members of their families would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified in Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had asked for the guarantor of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been tried before.
“About 80 per cent of persons who are either guarantors or members of their families are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners who have committed the crime.
That is why we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albens said.
In an effort to speed up the process of registering children, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than 60 days as before.
To declare their legal status to an immigration judge, many of them are present by video link, not in person.
Those who are considered not entitled to assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and information that has appeared in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tent camps without giving them time to emotionally prepare or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw troops immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country's war being waged for eight years.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“They must leave immediately and without any conditions,” he told the crowd.
Muallem insists that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions have been expelled from their homes since 2011, “the war on terror is almost over.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this sacred battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” from terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, which mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
The French contingent has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Mualem said good conditions had been created for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prompted refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to rebuild until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last major stronghold of the Idlib rebels has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front militants, who would be “destroyed.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, will be convened in the near future to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the commission’s work should be limited to “reviewing articles of the current constitution,” and cautioned against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following this logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 if impeachment and scandal do not prematurely end his presidency, which is what many liberal spectators probably hope for.
And it will undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale in history!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, prime time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million primetime viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC show “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable ratings, gathering 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during the main news show.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s beyond our understanding,” says Neil Barr, director of ABC’s drama The Appointed Survivor, about a cabinet member who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed by the attack.
Nell Skovell, a long-published comedy writer and author of Just Funny: A Few Unpleasant Truths About Penetrating the Hollywood Boys’ Club, offers another theory.
She recalls driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
He replied, “Yes, because he’s funny!” said Mrs. Skovell.
There's something valuable in all this chaos - it's fun.
Of course, unlike all the other content broadcast on television, the storylines of Washington’s events can determine the future of Row vs. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of immigrant families reuniting and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you’ve been watching for the sixth hour in a row, how a group of experts usually discuss Bob Woodward’s use of the “deep background” for his book Fear, or about Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-skinned jacket (clothing insulated with pride, as the Washington Post writes), or Stormy’s harsh description of it.
I’ll never look at Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of his job is to make us feel like the reality show is feeding you something every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the changing cast of the Trump show and the daily plot twists.
You can’t afford to miss a single episode, or you’re hopelessly behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, there was 27 degrees of heat on the north bank of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his house and watching MSNBC while recording on CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they show Brett Cavanaugh appearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and deciding the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows, people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleis said.
“I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Outsider money pours into the toughest midterm elections the White House is holding
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania’s 17th District receives a cash flow thanks to a change in congressional districts in which two officials race for the same seat.
This suburban area of Pittsburgh, whose geography was recently changed, supports the Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won a seat in another district in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which crosses substantially with the new 17th.
The charts were revised after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that as a result of election fraud, the old districts were in violation of the constitution attributed to Republicans.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement sparked a heated debate about funding campaigns between the main party’s financial forces, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign National Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became known in Pennsylvania after winning a small margin in the March special congressional election in Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20-point lead.
Political experts give the Democrats a small advantage.
The United States punished El Salvador for supporting China, but then retreated
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which caused a negative reaction from Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. His property was also in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the possibility of punishment was only considered for El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this Central American country with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
Against the background of regular internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which was to be held to summarize a similar meeting last year, which was perceived as a step forward in efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
By mid-September, however, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the preparations for the conference to move forward, and had effectively stopped considering the issue of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October, and Vice President Mike Pence will speak at it in a sign that the administration attaches real importance to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomats have safely returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without bringing any new tough messages or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was reported by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by a third-party analyst, who is part of the administration, but also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study the history
The next step could be to report to Special Adviser Robert Mueller that Mr. Trump may be obstructing justice, as there is now very substantial evidence in public records.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether there is evidence of a Trump campaign collusion with Russia and its attack during the past election.
If Congress succeeds, Mr. Trump will face responsibility in that body, just as he prepares to speak again to voters, and perhaps eventually to a jury of his colleagues.
But there are many “ifs”; I don’t want to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, as is the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état and overthrow Hitler, and this would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we did not, and this missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history unfolds precisely at such points, and the relentless march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are experiencing some of these turning points right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, last year he offered to make secret records of the president’s activities and discussed his unfitness for office.
Mr. Rosenstein argues that the Times' data is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or truthful, or if he is still confirmed to the post of Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote for a Congress in the medium term that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests with dignity, then this winter will be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to pass them with dignity thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime whose officials once occupied the embassy house where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later accompanied me to light Saturday candles on a table with a swastika symbol.
With a family past like this, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic in the run-up to the clash with the Viennese football club Rapid.
The Rangers take Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month, will allow them to take strong positions in Group G of the Europa League.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from playing for the first time in the season to a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard to achieve great results.
“It was a good moment for us because Villarreal are a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game thinking we could get something and left with no one.
Maybe in the end, we could have done it, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first half, and our success came in the second half, where we showed ourselves better.
There will be another big European night this Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they showed a good result in their last game, but given the support of the fans, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
“Last year was definitely a tough year, given everything that has to do with my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but there is a good factor in this place right now.
The composition is perfectly matched, and the guys really enjoy it; the training went on "hurrah".
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women lose sleep due to fear for their retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed with their spouses the cost of long-term care.
However, only 10% said they talked about it with their children.
“People want to be cared for by someone in the family, but they don’t try to discuss it with them,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
And that's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family for what they’ll probably have to take care of you if you don’t voice your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you will get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in terms of spending.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop a plan to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term care insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insured with your own property, provided you have the money.
Get your legal documents in order: get rid of legal battles.
Draw up a power of attorney for medical care and appoint a trustee who will oversee your medical care and make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend that you consider the possibility of drawing up a financial power of attorney.
You should choose a trusted person who will help you make financial decisions and monitor the payment of your bills in case you find yourself incapacitated.
Do not forget about the little things: imagine that your elderly parent needed urgent medical care, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Will you be able to provide information about what medications he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on paper so that you can prepare properly just in case.
Martin adds: “Not only is the availability of finances important, but also the choice of doctors.”
“What medications do you take?
Who will take care of your dog?
Make a plan and write it down.”
In Ilfracombe, a man shot several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man fired a pneumatic rifle several times, returning home from a party.
The victim, who had been shot in the chest, abdomen and arm for 40 years, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 GMT, as an “accident.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and police are currently looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communications, rescuers can not get any information from Donggal, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of a natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (data for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a county stretching along 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, an administrative district smaller than the province, had 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the backbone of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province's economy, but is mainly concentrated in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, over the past 100 years, the tsunami has caused several destruction in Palu and Donggala.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
The tsunami also occurred in western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Volcanic Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake erupted south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami on the southern coast that killed about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake occurred in the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pidi Jaya district of Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people remembered the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tsunami did not occur, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists temporarily remained under the ruins.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasilisa, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence situation, and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaskan police.
According to a police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in Mat-Su detention facility and will be released on bail of $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked if he was guilty, he declared his “unequivocal innocence.”
Palin faces three class A petty crimes, which means he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a class B crime, punishable by up to one day ' s imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police, reporting the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veteran’s Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcohol intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ groups in 2016 after explaining her son’s brutal behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder allegedly obtained as a result of his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
Videos of the incident appear on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutor’s office wants to issue a rare death sentence to the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York
The federal prosecutor's office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been used in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly rented a Home Depot truck to attack a bicycle path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “deliberately” killed eight people and “deliberately” caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of intent to enforce the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, on both charges, the death penalty may be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal jury read out Saipov’s 22-point indictment, which included eight racketeering murder charges commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as charges of violence and destruction of cars.
According to prosecutors, the attack was “carefully planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “in a disgusting, cruel and criminal way”.
Saifullo Habibullaevich Saipov inflicted injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lauren Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferrucci, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damiana Pagnuk.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the Southern District of New York demanded the death penalty for a criminal offence.
In September 2009, defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed using an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was glad that he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He denies his guilt on all 22 counts of indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s federal public defenders, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to use the death penalty rather than life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only exacerbate the pain of these events for all participants,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense had previously appealed to prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP Says Nigel Farage Should Not Be Responsible for Brexit Talks
Today, during a protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize the people’s army.”
The former leader of Ukip said politicians should “feel the heat” of eurosceptics, as one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative Party member Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that Britain would already be “out” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
However, the problem that Mrs May faces in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks is also exacerbated by the fact that members of the Tory party, who oppose leaving the EU, join a separate protest against Brexit, which takes place in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan voiced at Checkers in the midst of attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that she continue to try to make a deal with Brussels despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at a Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to “beat the Checkers.”
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be levelled and held responsible for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to support Brexit, but we need to beat the Checkers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is completely untrue.”
Tori party Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally, giving reporters the following comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to the people.”
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular with members of our party and our activists who are actually storming the streets and electing us first.
Please put aside the Checkers and start listening to what you’re being told.”
In a sharp address to Ms May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain at their jobs if they remain true to their promises.”
Mr. Farage said that if politicians are going to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum, then they need to be made to “feel nauseous.”
“It’s now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he says.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let this go.’”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel narcissistic.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of Brexit held a demonstration on Birmingham, then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists were waving “Tory vs. Brexit” posters this weekend.
At the opening of the conference, a member of the Labour Party, Lord Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for security concerns in their party's mobile app.
“And these people claim to be able to set up Canada plus plus IT systems and technologies to work at borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to “carefully study” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
U.S. Congresswoman Elizabeth Warren says she will “carefully study the possibility of running for president” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday told about his future at a meeting of the town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Party member Jeff Deale, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are rumors that she has a chance to take the post of Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, she held another meeting with voters in Holyoke; since Trump took office, it was her 36th meeting with voters in the format of a town hall meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to “fix” our broken government, and that requires a woman to be upstairs.”
As a result of the murder of Sims (stuck), an LSU player was arrested
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced on Saturday that a suspect in the killing (shooting) of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday had been arrested.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, Baton Rouge Police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, police released a video of the shooting requesting help to identify the man who was captured on video.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the South University campus on Friday morning.
“Wade Sims was shot in the head and died,” Murphy police chief J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade pleaded for his friend, and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and confessed to being involved in the incident, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
At the time of his arrest, Simpson did not resist and was taken into custody by the East Button Rouge County Police Department.
A young man 1 m 82 cm tall grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and scored an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team tactics gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified on Saturday, overtaking Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that Mercedes’ team tactics would play a big role in the race.
Already with the pole position Bottas started well and practically hung on Hamilton, when he defended his position in the first two corners, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to go to the pit stop, leaving Hamilton to weave in the tail of the whole group – a choice that became decisive.
The Mercedes went to pit stop one round later, and then came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton, after some wheel-to-wheel struggle, pulled forward, which led to the Ferrari driver reluctantly leaving the interior space free, risking getting caught after a double move for protection on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place towards the end of the first round.
Then he drove most of the race, holding on to his native tires, in order to finish quickly, pushing Kimi Räikkönen to fourth place.
As a result, he went on to pit stop in the 44th lap, but could not increase the pace in the remaining eight lap, as Räikkönen took fourth place.
The day turned out to be a difficult one, as Valtteri did a fantastic job over the weekend and showed real nobility by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
The Treacherous Language of Gestures
President Donald Trump criticized Senator Diane Feinstein at a meeting with voters on Saturday for her allegation that she had not released a letter from Christina Blacy Ford accusing Brett Cavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was happening in the Senate showed that the participants in these events were “detestable, disgusting and lying people.”
“The only possible response to all of this, and what’s been happening in the last few days in the Senate, is beautiful, it’s anger, it’s anger, it’s disgusting and it’s a lie,” he said.
“You see all these leaks, and then they say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.
I didn’t do that.”
You remember?
Did Diane Feinstein “send” the information?
Do you remember her answer... did you "swallow" the information of the document? - "what, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't drain.
All right, stop.
“We didn’t,” he added with the senator’s intonation.
In July, Feinstein sent a letter detailing Ford's charges against Cavanaugh, and in early September it was illegally released, but Feinstein denies that the leak occurred in her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I didn’t leak her information,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep this information a secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the manner in which she denied the leak accusations did not seem to appeal to the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s rally: “Here’s what I’ll tell you: her body language was a great disappointment.
She may not have been draining, but her body language was the worst I’ve ever seen.”
While continuing to defend his Supreme Court nominee, who was accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are definitely trying to regain power in all available ways.
We are witnessing abominations, abominations, they don’t care who they offend, who they have to step over to gain power and control,” Mediaite said.
British Elite Hockey League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a game against Dundee.
In the Elite Hockey League game, the Dundee Stars paid for Friday's defeat against the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch on Saturday with a score of 5-3 in favor of Dundee.
The Giants received an early two-goal lead thanks to the strikes of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney raised the home team before Dwyer took the Giants to the top.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized Dundee before two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
For Adam Keefe's men, who defeated Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
Between the two sides, it was the fourth meeting of the season when the Giants won three previous matches.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 after Kendall McFall's goal pass with the support of David Rutherford, after which Beauviller doubled the lead four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt contributed to Coney's 15:16 settlement.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took the initiative in the first break when he scored the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The hosts regrouped, and Bouchard again leveled the score, scoring a goal with a numerical advantage of 27:37.
Coney and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nilsen give Dundee the opportunity to take the lead for the first time in a match at the end of the second period, after which he and his team secured the victory, keeping rivals in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, are heading to Milton Keynes for the next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller died in order to hundreds of people on board the plane, could avoid an earthquake
The Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero after he consciously went to death in order to allow the plane with hundreds of passengers to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many went missing in a powerful earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong tremors continue to destroy the area, many residents of the city of Palu found themselves under the rubble of buildings.
Despite his colleagues escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport, Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the time on the runway, was able to take off safely.
Then, when he thought the tower was collapsing, he jumped off it.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatcher died before the helicopter even managed to land in Palu.
“We are very sorry for this loss,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll from the earthquake could reach thousands of people, as according to the disaster relief agency, access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is probably increasing, as a large number of people are still under the rubble, and many have not been able to get out of there,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, devastated the city of Palu, which will host a mass burial of the dead on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft deliver humanitarian aid to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “Emergency care brings victims every minute.
There is a lack of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is already in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know that they will be there.
The tragedy has already taken on a rather serious scale, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and spoke to the country’s armed forces, saying in particular: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all evacuation tasks.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports one person missing after plane crashes in lagoon
The airline carrying out the flight, which crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now reports that one person has gone missing, while earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew safely left the sinking plane.
According to Air Niugini, as of Saturday afternoon, she does not have any information about one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline was unable to immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and the plane's crew after it crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline also said that on Saturday, six passengers were hospitalized and all of them are in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses say the plane was unable to land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes says that the plane began to enter the runway too low.
“And that’s very good,” adds Janes.
Janes said that he and other passengers managed to get to the emergency exits on the sinking plane, as the water level was up to the belt.
He also said the flight attendants panicked and shouted on board, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors who repaired the berth nearby also helped rescue the boat, using an inflatable boat they were taking people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in plane crashes involving PNG-registered companies over the past two decades, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
Intelligence analyst was able to prove the fact of burning a woman alive
On Saturday, the prosecution opened a case against a man accused of burning a Mississippi resident in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett gave hours of testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to paint a picture of the actions of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett said he got the data on the whereabouts of these people from several mobile phones; according to these data, Tellis spent time with Chambers that night, which contradicts his previous testimony, reports The Clarion Ledger.
He said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his mobile phone was near Chambers; when this became clear, the police questioned Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford stated that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was telling the truth, claiming that he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said that “it’s a lie because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another discrepancy was that Tellis said he had met Chambers two weeks before her death.
According to the phone records, however, they only called for one week.
Rowlett also revealed that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis removed her text messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale says.
The defense is due to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A trio of hip-hop artists are going to fight a negative attitude to this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed claims that the content of hip-hop has changed, moving away from the original political and social problems.
The band members want to get back to their roots and make “conscious” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
New York babysitter sues couple over racist text message
A New York nanny sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message from a woman complaining that the nanny turned out to be “another black” that a woman mistakenly sent to the nanny instead of her husband.
The couple deny that they are racist, claiming that the lawsuit was filed with the “target of extortion.”
Linsey Plasco-Flexman, a mother of two, expressed concern after learning that the new babysitter offered by the childcare service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
“It’s not just that, it’s just another black one,” Mrs. Plasco-Flexman wrote in a text to her husband.
However, instead of texting her husband, she mistakenly sent him twice to Miss Morris.
Aware of her misconduct, Plasco-Flexman fired Maurice, saying on the service that the babysitter, who turned out to be African-American, was poorly doing her job, and in general that they were expecting a Filipina, and not an African-American, reports the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple and demanding $350 a day in compensation for the six-month redundancy – under the terms of the original verbal agreement, which, however, were not fixed by any contract.
“I want them to understand that such things are unacceptable,” she told The Post on Friday, adding, “And I know it’s discrimination.”
The spouses disagree with the accusation of racism, and argue that the dismissal of Maurice can be considered a reasonable step, since, having offended her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her a message that she didn’t really mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racist,” her husband, Joe Plasco, told the Post.
But would you entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if you were rude without wanting to?
Would you trust your newborn?
Come on, you!”
Calling the lawsuit “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you ready to persecute a person who finds himself in such a situation?
Not very nice of you,” added a bank employee specializing in investing.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already handed down its sentence on social media, accusing the couple of unacceptable behavior and problems with logic.
Paddington publishers feared that readers would not understand the move with the talking bear, says a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted by the publisher, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in the place of someone who reads the work for the first time, even before it is published.
It’s fun to know that Paddington is a huge success.”
She also said her father, before he decided to write a children's book about the bear, worked as an operator for the BBC, and would have been optimistic about the refusal to publish, adding that the 60th anniversary of his books was "both joyful and bitter" because last year their author died.
As for Paddington himself, she refers to him as a "very important member of our family" and that her father was quietly proud that his character eventually gained fame.
“He was a quiet and humble man,” his daughter says.
“For Paddington was so real to him, and it was almost as if his own child had succeeded: he was proud of him, although he did not really consider this success to be his own merit.
I think he treated Paddington’s success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always paid tribute to the bear itself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After the plane landed, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called and said that everything was really bad, that something went wrong,” says Mrs. Ednan-Laperousa.
“Then he called again and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that we should say goodbye.
That's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, darling.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The drugs that doctors gave her, making her heart work, gradually ceased to work, leaving her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing it was coming to an end.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold myself firmly in my hands.”
In the end, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, resigning herself to the enormous loss she had just suffered.
“Nobody around here knew what happened,” she said.
“My head was swollen, I kept crying.
It is difficult to explain, but it was during the flight that I experienced this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I know how much he loved her.”
Women who survived the loss of loved ones, prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from taking this step.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post postcards on Welsh Bridge with comforting words and phone numbers that people can call for support.
Mrs. Davis Tyler’s son was 13 years old when he became depressed and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a great cook and had a devilishly charming smile.
“Everyone loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was like a light was on in the room.”
However, before he died, he left his job because he was going through a really terrible time.”
It happened in 2014, and Tyler was found by his brother, who was then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis says, “I never stop being afraid of a chain reaction.”
Mrs. Davis came up with these postcards “so people know there’s someone to turn to and tell you everything, even if it’s your friend.
You can’t sit still, you have to talk to people.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, with whom she lived for 15 years – he died shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed, upset or anything like that,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He felt particularly ill at Christmas: he didn’t even look at the children when they opened their presents.”
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through this, this event has shocked our family.
It tore it apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future hangs in the balance: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked for — an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring at least some unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “breaking up” against the backdrop of a growing party chain reaction.
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their hesitation.
The midterm elections will take place in just five weeks, on November 6, and if — as expected — things go badly for Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to get the person they want and elect him to the post of the country’s supreme judge.
George W. Bush is calling the senators, lobbying for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who has since worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, then Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of equality of votes and confirm his candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice.
The number of defectors from North Korea has decreased under Kim
Since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Beyoncé Seug, citing data from the southern ministry, said that compared to 2,706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure fell to 1,127 last year.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates charged by smugglers exporting people.
Pyongyang does not make any public comments.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily-protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views defectors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
North-South relations, which are still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang to resume stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This came after the June historic meeting of US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, at which they reached general agreements on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yun Ho accused the United States of obstructing progress on the issue with its sanctions.
“If we don’t have even the slightest confidence in the United States, we also don’t have confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will in no way be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Ree said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, a Supreme Court nominee, “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in this way, she would immediately be called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony at the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally rejected Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s allegations of sexual harassment that allegedly took place when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh performed emotionally, sometimes even shouting and suffocating, telling about his family and school years.
He also unequivocally condemned the committee’s Democrats, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and clearly planned assassination of an actor” orchestrated by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi also said that, in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a biased attitude towards Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualifying himself with his allegations, as well as the way he’s throwing himself at the Clintons and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh to justice if his guilt was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit not only for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or Row v. Wade, as he is considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kavanaugh sided with the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time to let a hysterical and biased person serve as a supreme judge and at the same time exclaim, ‘How wonderful!’”
Women should own it.
It is righteous anger, months and years of rage, she cannot go through it without tears.
“When we’re angry, we cry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She went on to say, “I had a lot of help from a woman who worked somewhere in the management position. She said that she also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique by which she explained to her interlocutor: ‘You might think I’m crying because I’m upset.
I’m actually angry.”
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are fundamentally mistreated.
One of my most painful memories of my first job in an office dominated by men: I once cried with furious anger, but I was caught by the whirlwind by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I had always feared terribly, and dragged to the staircase.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re crying out of anger.
They think you’re upset, and they’re happy to think they’ve finally brought you here.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught in some frivolous affair and out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason to prevent her from running for president.
“This decision was not well thought out,” she admitted to me with a smile 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the case "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
The campaign was already coming to an end, she was lagging far behind in fundraising, and so she swore that she would not participate in the race if she did not raise $2 million.
It seemed to be a completely lost option.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 each to men, offered her only $250.
“What am I, a priceless commodity to them?” she wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so engrossed in emotion — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and access voters, and anger at gender discrimination that she was suffocating.
“You’d think I was having a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still wondering, what would they write on my monument?
“She was crying all the time?”
How a Trade War with America Could Benefit Beijing
Experts believe the first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were dazzling, and while the battle is far from over, a split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, made the first warning earlier this year by taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when new tariffs impacted $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods entering the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, recently imposing tariffs on $60 billion worth of American goods ranging from five to ten percent.
China has promised that the retaliatory measures against the United States will be equivalent each time, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to experience even the slightest difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to back down is to yield, but publicly yielding to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts believe that if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, U.S. trade war pressure could provide long-term support to China, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a speedy political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions that would lead to an economic cork in either of these countries is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Security, an Asia-based think tank.
Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and seeks help in rebuilding a country that has been devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground has become more stable and safer thanks to the successes in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can live peacefully there.
At present, all conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country they have had to leave because of terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for its help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
But he stressed that the country will not accept assistance on any terms or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe confirms victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 – 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. has lost on European soil six times in a row, and the European Ryder Cup has not been won since 1993.
Europe regained its crown thanks to the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who scored 14.5 points to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought hard for most of the tournament, made his first long-distance punch in the water on the 16th hole of par-3, conceding his match Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the 1st-4th player ever to go 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit lost 5:4 by the player with the lowest rating in the European team, Turbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup last time.
Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the winner of the tournament in European history with 25.5 points per career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t stand it.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very happy to win the cup again.
It’s all about the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” says emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his compatriot John Ram, who on Sunday defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods with a 2-1 score in a singles game.
“I’m incredibly proud of this win — I grew up watching Tiger Woods play,” says Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These figures are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, behind only Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team fought throughout the weekend, in vain trying to succeed. The exception was Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who showed the highest class of golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furik said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we managed to shake Europe slightly.
It didn't work.
We take off our hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we will move forward to achieve success.
I love all 12 guys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to lose.
We have lost.”
Red tide: news The concentration of microorganisms decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
The latest report of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission reflects an overall decline in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, in the areas of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, abundant flowering is reported, which indicates a decrease in the concentration of microorganisms.
The Red Tide stretches for about 130 miles of coastline from northern Pinell to the southern districts of Lee.
The hot spots can be observed about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but their number has decreased significantly compared to last week.
The red tide is also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, average concentrations were reported in and around Pinellas County, from low to high concentrations in the coastal area of Hillsborough County, high concentrations in Manati County and Sarasota County and in coastal areas, average concentrations in Charlotte County, high concentrations on the Lie County coast, and low concentrations in Collier County.
In Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, there is still a possibility of respiratory irritation.
In northwest Florida, no such probability was reported last week.
