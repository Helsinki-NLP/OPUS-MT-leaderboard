Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear that they will be “looking like fools”
Some members of the National Assembly were frightened by the proposal to change their title to “MWP” (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal came into being in line with plans to change the names of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Now the members of the assembly of the various parties fear that this will bring reproach.
One Labour MP said his party was concerned that "it rhymes with the words twp and pwp in short."
For those outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means foolish, and "pwp" means poop.
A Wales MP said the party as a whole was “unrested” and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said that his party is approaching the change of the name "liberal", but noted that from the abbreviation "MWP" is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similar to the letter "u".
At the same time, the Commission of the Assembly is working on a draft law that will change the names, which states: "For the final decision on the eventual designation of the deputies, the deputies themselves will naturally be responsible."
The Wales Governance Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the debate on the proposals with the public. The results showed that the change of the name of the meeting to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
With regard to the designation of members of the assembly, the Commission preferred the names "Wales MPs" (WMP), but the greatest support in the discussion with the public was given to the possibility of the MWP.
Clearly, the members of the assembly are trying to propose alternatives, but an agreement can be a problem, especially for the President, Elin Jones, who is about to propose a bill of amendment within a few weeks.
Reform laws will include further changes in the way in which the assembly works, including the rules governing the expulsion of members and the drafting of the committee system.
And the messengers of the congregation shall have the last word concerning their mark, when they speak of the law.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The electorate will vote on whether the name of their country should be changed to “Republic of North Macedonia. ”
The people were called out to try to resolve a dispute that had been going on for several decades with neighboring Greece, which has a province of its own called Macedonia.
Greece has long insisted that the names of its northern neighbour reflect the claim to Greek territory and, therefore, the repeated intentions against the country’s aspirations for membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President <0xC4><0x90>orge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has declared that he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum returned to Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that the name change is simply a price that the country must pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of the Church of St. Martin in the aftermath of the problems of the churches in Harlem have died down
“The ancients with whom I spoke say that in the past there was a barn and a shrine in every corner, ” says Adams.
"Today there is neither one nor the other."
In his opinion, the loss of bars is understandable.
"Men socialize in a different way today," he says.
“At least this is no longer a place where people from all over the world meet regularly. ”
Now concerning the churches, he fears that the money from the handing over of the property will not last as long as the experts think it will. “In the beginning, ” they said,“ it will happen again sooner or later. ”
And just as he found out, the shrines could be crowded out by the houses of rent, and the quarters would be filled with people who would not support the remaining temples in the surrounding area.
“The majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be made white. ” he said.“ The day is coming when these shrines will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of the people who come to these four buildings will belong to them. ”
Both churches built white congregations before Harlem became the metropolis of the Negro population. The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, the Church of St. Martin ten years later.
The original white congregation of Methodists was detached in the thirties of the last century.
The building was claimed by the black congregation, which practiced piety not far away.
The Church of St. Martin was taken over by black congregations led by Reverend John Howard Johnson. He was a central figure in the boycott of retailers on 125th Street (the most important shopping street in Harlem) who refused to hire and support blacks.
The fire damaged the building in 1939, but the parishioners of Father Johnson commissioned the bell tower as part of plans to rebuild the church.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor”.
The spy, who played the bell in the yule, called it a “culture treasure” and an “indispensable historical instrument.”
This specialist is Tiffany Ngo of the University of Michigan, who also noted that it was the first bell in the world, which was played by a black musician – Dionysio A. Lind. He began playing the larger bell in the skeleton of Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says he was never replaced in St. Martin's Cathedral.
During the last few months in the church of St. Martin, a complicated story of architects and suppliers was told. Some of them were brought by the church leaders of the world, others by the episcopal diocese.
And the administration of the Pharisees, which are the rulers of the world, and of the Pharisees, and of the dioceses in the city of Yule, wrote that they feared that the diocese would leave the expenses to the administration of the Pharisees, and that the administration of the Pharisees was not given to the hires of the architects, and to the supplies of the dioces.
But some of the parishioners complained about the lack of transparency in the conduct of the diocese.
13-Year-Old Boy Who Hunted Lobster in California Wounded by Shark
On Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was attacked and wounded by a shark, a boy hunting lobster in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been walking for about half an hour on a Saturday morning when they heard the boy screaming for help. Then he sailed with the group to the boy to get him out of the water.
But Hammel said that he thought at first that the boy was thrilled that he had seized the lobster. Then he found the boy shouting, “Something has bit me!
Something's sniffed!'
He had a broken collarbone. ” Then Hammel said, noticing what had happened the first time he had reached the boy.
And I begged them all to go out of the water, saying, A shark is in the water.
The boy was taken by air to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The kind of shark he attacked is unknown.
At the briefing, the captain of the coast guard, Larry Giles, reported that a shark had been spotted in the area some weeks ago, but that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that she had suffered wounds in the upper part of her body.
For 48 hours, investigation and security authorities have blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Carlsbad to Swami's area in Encinitas.
And Giles noted that there are more than 135 kinds of sharks in the region, but they are not considered dangerous by most.
Sainsbury's plans to invest in the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom
Sainsbury's wants to create avenues with cosmetics in the back of commercial homes, competing with the Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams chains. Specialized assistants will be available.
This is a great investment of 2.8 billion pounds in the cosmetics market in the United Kingdom, which will continue to grow, but the sales of fashion and household goods will decline. This investment will test the major alleys of cosmetics in 11 stores.
Now the investment in cosmetics comes at a time when the supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the place on the shelves, which once belonged to televisions and microwaves and household necessities.
Sainsbury’s representatives have revealed that they will double their cosmetics range to 3,000 products, with Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw available for the first time.
Simultaneous boards of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees products will receive more prestigious titles, as places reserved for brands similar to the Boots stores will be available.
In addition, the supermarket is bringing to market its advice to Boutique, so that the majority of the products may be available also to vegans, for the younger customers demand it even more.
The Fragrance Shop will also test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores. The first store was opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will be opened by the end of the year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping online and the trend of daily buying small amounts of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, general manager of Sainsbury’s, explained that there would be more and more tradespeople like him. His chain of supermarkets was trying to compete with Aldi and Lidl’s discount money, offering more services than food.
And the company of Sainsbury's, which in the hundreds of trades had been sold by Argos, and the very few that were sold by Habitat integrated, and the two chains bought the company two years ago. And by this step the sale of food increased, according to those who represented it, and by this the acquisitions were more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to innovate the department with cosmetics and medicaments failed.
After 2000, Sainsbury's community tested the joint operation with the Boots chain, but the union ended the dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the pharmacy in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 Celesio stores three years ago. The company owns the LloydsPharmacy chain and has a value of <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Now the public had heard that Lloyds would play a more prominent role in adding a wider range of premium skin care labels, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s sales manager, said: “We have changed the look and feel of the streets and the cosmetics so that our customers can shop in a more pleasant environment.
And in addition to this, we have invested in the training of our fellow workers, who are ready and ready to help, by means of messages.
Our sign board has been designed to suit all requirements. The effective environments and practical locations mean that we have become a significant destination in the field of cosmetics, which is an innovation of traditional shopping. "
Peter Jones is “outraged” by Holly Willoughby’s 11-million-pound contract
Dragons' Day star Peter Jones is "infuriated" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has terminated an 11-million-pound contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with the Marks and Spencer and ITV communities.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of interior accessories and Truly accessories.
The company of these two men was compared to the mark of Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
This Morning, 37, has announced on Instagram that it is coming to an end.
Holly Willoughby was furious with the Dragons' Day star Peter Jones, for she had for the last moment withdrawn from the joint lucrative trade with the brand of products of life, so that she could converge on her new mega-contracts with the communities of Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that Jones "looked up" when the golden girl television during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, assumed that the new covenants - worth up to 1.5 million pounds - meant that they would not have enough time to get out of their interiors until Tuesday.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated assets of 11 million pounds.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew away from Britain and headed to one of his holiday homes.
One source said: “Truly’s project was clearly Holly’s number one priority.
For it was to be for a long time, and it was to be kept for some ten years.
And her decision to go away was absolutely shocked to all who were with her.
On the third day of the week, no one understood what was happening. The market was near.
At the headquarters in Marlowe, there is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is one of the most lucrative stars of Britain, can become a company of millions. The reason is huge investments in products from vancushes and candles to clothing and household accessories, but it was also possible to introduce the company.
And this is the end of the long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Cappova for ten years.
Willoughby designed the Truly project with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, became a riadist in March.
These two couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become the M&S ambassador to replace Ant McPartlin, who hosts I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not go into business."
It was a difficult conversation, and after that we were very pleased with ourselves.
He joked about the criticism that the media awaited from him for his comment, which some will regard as “unworthy of a president” and will accuse him of having spoken so positively about the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump sacrifice so much?
Trump responded with a laughing “moderator” voice.
“I promised nothing at all. ”
He noted that after the initial meeting in June in Singapore, Kim was interested in the second meeting. Trump celebrated the first meeting as a major step on the way to the elimination of North Korea's nuclear weapons.
However, the deadlines for the removal of nuclear weapons have been suspended.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Korey Ri Jong, said on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “triggered response” from the US to North Korea’s first steps on disarmament.
And he noted that the United States had instead imposed sanctions to increase the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his interview before the meeting.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
"With North Korea, we were in danger of war.
And millions of men would die.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results — an end to missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of senior U.S. troops home.
He also defended the unusual way in which he talked about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to speak like a president, but then there wouldn’t be 10,000 people outside trying to get in, instead of 200,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake destroyed one of the islands in Indonesia and killed hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, the foreign powers of the organizations learned that their help was not needed.
Even though more than ten percent of the people of Lombok had to leave their homes, no nationwide catastrophe was declared, which is an indispensable substitute for international aid.
"In many cases," said Sumbung, "they have made it clear that they will not ask for international help, and so it is a little complicated."
While Save the Children will put in place those who are traveling to Palo, it is not yet certain whether foreign workers will have the opportunity to work in the field.
Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the spokesman for the disaster agency, explained that the Indonesian authorities were examining the situation in Palo to see if the international agencies would be allowed to participate in the relief work.
Now concerning the earthquakes which Indonesia is continually facing, the readiness of the land for the wrath of nature is grievous.
In the city of Acehu, indeed, there are shelters from the tsunami, but on the other shores they cannot escape.
It is probable that a large number of life-sacrifices had taken place in Palos, where a siren was waiting for a tsunami to come, despite the fact that a warning had been given.
But even with such a change of heart, the journey between many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters cut the logistics even more.
And the ship which was in Lombok, to give care to the sacrifices of the earthquake, was sent to Palo; and it shall be for at least three days, till it shall be in a place of a new plague.
President Joko Widodo set up his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s raging infrastructure, spending a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the administration of the seer is troubled by a lack of finances, with decisions yet to be made for the coming year.
Besides this, because of the continuing religious tensions in Indonesia, the people of the majority of the Moslems have received a more conservative form of faith, they face the pressure of the vision.
More than 1,000 people were killed in the fighting between Christian and Moslem gangs in the streets. Tens of thousands more had to leave their homes. The gangs used machetes, bows, arrows, and other raw weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge of FC Liverpool from a distance leveled against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League. He scored in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 meters from the Chelsea goal, which he lost 1-0 at the time.
He switched the ball to his left and fired a shot at a more distant jersey.
His attempt sailed high above the penalty area, pointing to the right upper corner of the gate.
Finally the ball was thrown into a net through the hill called Arrizabellaga, which was just about to begin.
“I was trying to get into the ball, ” he said.“ Players like Shaq always try to play ahead, so I tried to make time for myself. ” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw that Kant was approaching, and I made one touch. I didn’t think hard about it, but I gave it a shot. ”
Chelsea led after the half-time 1:0. In the 25th minute, the Belgian star Eden Hazard scored for her.
In front of the goal, Blues returned the score to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, turned around in the middle of the field and sprinted halfway to Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made a quick bump in the middle of the field.
Then he sent out a beautiful piece of silver coin, which went with Hazard to the penalty area.
Hazard overtook the defenders and ended up at a more distant pole when he left-handedly defeated Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool are waiting for a match against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League. The match begins on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will fight Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday from 3 p.m. in London.
Number of tsunami victims in Indonesia stupol at 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, and the country’s disaster agency reported this early in the morning.
According to the authorities, many people were tied up in the rubble of buildings that had been destroyed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5. The earthquake struck on Friday and caused a wave of up to 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugro, the spokesman for the agency, said at a meeting of the people.
The city of Palu, which had more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with the ruins of the ruined buildings.
The police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman who had been stabbed to death.
A murder investigation began this morning after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, at Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found 7:55 with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
They told people in the area who had seen or heard anything. They told them to come and tell them what had happened.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its infancy, but I appeal to all who have been near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In the same way, I urge all of you, especially the taxi drivers, to join us in whatever you see with the camera, because they are able to have key information for our investigations. ”
The officer who spoke to Paul confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and that she was in danger of death.
To-day they came to the place of the work of friends, who supposedly knew a woman, seeking to find out where she was found early in the morning.
And the questioning of the priests and the police showed that at the same time he was informing the family members of the sacrifice.
Now the taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was trying to get into his own apartment. But he told him that no one was allowed to enter the building or leave the building.
But when he found out what had happened, he was not able to say anything.
And the owners of the houses will learn that they will be inside again in a few hours.
And they heard one of the policemen saying to another that the whole region was at the same time a place of action.
And a weeping woman appeared in the place.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible too."
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the cordon, while another van was standing outside.
A few policemen were standing in the cordon, watching the panel house.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia requests that all those who have information to send direct mail to <0x40>MerPolCC call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 with reference to Protocol 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in front of parliament is the latest in a dispute over "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a gratification for the fact that his fanatical Puritan followers, like the Taliban, destroyed so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts.
Cromwell's community, however, called Crick's proposal "crazy" and an "attempt to transcribe historia".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the present discussion about the removal of the draughts, it was self-evident that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the ends.
Cromwell did not order or execute the iconoclasm of the English civil wars.
Perhaps the false Cromwell had been sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the preceding century.
Cromwell’s grandiose accomplishments by Sir William Ham Thornycroft bear witness to his 19th-century perceptions and are a parallel of a personality narrative that many still deserving of respect.”
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many — perhaps by the end of the 19th century more than today — to be the protector of parliament from external forces, in his case, of course, the protector of the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate description of reality, historians continue to debate.
It is true, however, that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is the unique personality that embodies one side of this dispute.
In the same way, the successes which he has achieved as Lord Protector are worthy of praise and honor. ”
A dead man's hair has beaten a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local media authorities, a farmer was attacked and killed in a market in the south-east of China.
A man named Yuan was found dead with a broken artery and covered with blood near a loaf in the market-place of Liou-pan-shui, in the province of Kuezhou. The South China Morning Post reported the news.
She is preparing a vaccine in a scabbard on May 30, 2005 in Xining Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 skinny men on the market.
And it came to pass on the morrow, that his cousin found him dead, and found that the door of the house which was next to him was open.
And he said, There was a great male in the loins, having been stripped of the blood of the papule.
According to the administration of the court, the investigation confirmed that this 250-pound boar had crushed the farmer to death.
"The cousin had bloody and shattered legs," said the cousin, nicknamed Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
According to the record of the security guards, Yuan came to the market on the fourth day of the week, at 4:40 a.m., to feed his furry ones.
About an hour later his body was found.
The beast that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
And when the governor of the market reported to the Evening News that she had been stripped of her hair, that she might not attack another; but that she had gathered evidences in the place of the police.
Yuan’s family and market officials are reportedly seeking compensation for his death.
For though the attacks of those who have been robbed are rapacious, they have been recorded in the past.
In 2016, she attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing critical wounds to her husband.
Ten years later, when she was skinned and weighed 295 pounds, she pressed the farmer of Wales against the tractor until his wife was able to get rid of the animal.
After devouring a farmer from Oregon with his scabies in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that scabies are not usually aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger”.
"They're just playful.
The Chantyas, being perfidious, have no intention of hurting anyone.
He said, “We just have to show them the right way to live. ”
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rains in many places in the southwest of the United States
According to the prediction, Hurricane Rosa is weakening, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rainfall to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa reached a wind speed of 137 km/h at 5:00am East American time, which is the category 1 of the hurricane. It was located 620 kilometers southwest of the Mexican escapade of Punta Eugenia.
Now it is expected that Rosa will be heading north on the road.
And a riverbed began to form over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as the dew approached the peninsula of Baja California on Monday like a tropical storm, it began to push a deep tropical moisture northward toward the southwest of the United States.
Rosa brings more than 25 centimetres on Mondays in parts of Mexico.
Then the moisture in the tropics, combined with the approaching trough, will be scattered over the coming days in the southwest, and there will be heavy rain.
In some places it will fall two to ten centimeters. This will cause severe floods, flooding of rubble, and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rain, with a point of 5 to 8 millimetres per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some parts of the southwest, especially over much of Arizona, about five to ten centimeters [about an inch] of coal is expected.
There can be severe floods, for the floods are quickly getting worse by the scattered rains of the tropics.
Now, because of the threat of rain from the tropics, it would be very foolish to go on foot on a deserted road.
The rain can cause the rivers to swell up in the canyons, and the storms can bring a violent wind with dust in the air.
The approaching trough in some places on the coasts of southern California will cause heavy local rain.
More than 13 millimetres of rubble can fall, and this can cause a smaller amount of debris to spill over and cause the roadways to become rough.
It would be the first rain in the area during its rainy season.
It will be almost noon and very early on Monday morning, when the rainstorms from the tropics will come to Arizona. The rain will be very heavy on Monday and Tuesday.
It will rain hard on a Tuesday, and it will spread to the four corners of the city. It will last until the very middle of the city.
In the octopus there can be severe temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, for the Arctic is cooling, but the tropics remain moderately warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp changes in temperature at a short distance.
A good example of rapid temperature changes is the U.S. average.
The temperature difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is roughly 11 degrees.
But in the next few days he will try again to seduce himself, and to spread the remaining heat of the summer.
In the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of the october is expected in many places, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees Celsius on many stretches from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
It could be 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above the prime.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that there is a high probability of extreme temperatures in the east of the United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing was watched by more than 20 million people.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched on six television networks the powerful testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, the alleged attack on Christine Blasey-Ford in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, there was a political snare, until radio and television stations were interrupting the broadcasts for the last moment on Friday. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona secured a deal that would allow the FBI to investigate the charges on a weekly basis.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh was hugging her in a drunken state and trying to undress her at a high school party.
But Kavanaugh, who was passionate about this, said that he was 100% sure that it did not happen.
It is probable that the broadcast was watched by more than 20,4 million viewers, who were announced by the Nielsen community on Friday.
CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
For other networks that sent the transmission, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
The Nielsen community usually has trouble measuring audiences in offices.
For comparison, a similar number of spectators watch a play-off game of American football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, which was strongly supported by the MCs in Kavanaugh’s name, was followed by 5.69 million viewers during a full-day hearing, the most of all the networks.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
And after the questioning had been completed, the concern was high.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flake.
When the office of this moderate Republican announced that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras caught him on Friday morning, shouting at him as he sought to bring him to trial.
For a few minutes he stood with his eyes closed, listening to the reproaches broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one of the women.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
Someone said to him, “You have great authority, but many women are weak. ”
But Flake said that his offices had been given a notice. Before the heat was over, he added that he would give more account at the hearing of the committee.
And all the cables and the rest of the nets were kept alive for a few hours afterwards, when the judgment-seat had to decide whether or not Kavanaugh's nominee should be used by the whole Senate for a vote.
But Flake said that he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominee, which are urgently requested by the minority Democrats, during the next week.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with Democratic Senator Chris Coons, who is his friend.
After conversing with Coons and some other senators, Flake made a decision.
But Flake's counsel had great authority, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to hear Kavanaugh's approval without an inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “branch of political hierarchy” over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her intention to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and violating national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May attends the Conservative Party in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, attacked her Brexit plan, which is likened to a game of ladyship, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tariffs on each other was "completely absurd".
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspicious Dyteon Simpson After Death of LSU Player
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia arrested a suspect who allegedly shot Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player by the LSU.
Dyteon Simpson (20) was arrested and taken into custody on charges of second-degree murder, leading a police department in Baton Rouge.
Officials have released a video of a quarrel between the Sims and the Simpsons, and Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia has said that the Sims lost their eyebrows in the middle of the battle.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia oculiare found at the scene of the crime and reported that Simpson's DNA was found on them, reported the WAFB station, which is a partner of the CBS network.
After questioning Simpson, Polic<0xC3><0xAD>a informed him that he had confessed to shooting Sims.
According to information from the defender, his bail was set at $350,000.
The coroner's office in East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday gave a preliminary ruling, according to which the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanked the state police runaway unit in Louisiana, the state police crime lab, Southern University police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the local authorities for “salvation and the practice of righteousness”.
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where he played basketball for LSU and his father Wayne.
Last season he had a primer of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said he was "shocked" and "shocked" by Sims' death.
"That's what you're always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes at the city of Mexico
The ashes that are being rolled down from the volcano Popocatepetl have reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Service on Saturday warned Mexicans to avoid volcanoes after activity increased in the crater and 183 gas emissions and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
Several times Stredisko had heard noises and tremors.
Photos on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the glassy outskirts of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck the middle of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia got on the street with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters clashed with the police, and thousands more took part in parallel demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the Catalan vote to secede.
And the secessionists who had been masked were being stopped by the policemen, who were throwing eggs and powder paint, so that the streets were full of dark clouds of dust, crowded with tourists.
And it came to pass in the middle of the day, that there were also strifes; and the policemen used batons to bring the battlers under control.
For several hours, a group of independence supporters who sang “we don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist Protestants who shouted “Long live Spain.”
According to the local authorities, the people were pressed down and treated 14 people who had suffered minor injuries while they were protesting.
There is great tension in the region that seeks independence, even a year after the referendum of 1 October declared Madrid illegal, but was glorified by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of those who voted voted for independence, but their participation was low, because those who refused to obey the law boycotted the vote.
About 1,000 people were injured last year, according to the Catalan authorities, in an attempt to make it impossible for people to continue voting in polling stations throughout the region.
Groups of supporters of independence camped outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national policing.
And the demonstration continued, but it had to go in a different direction.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer believes Catalonia will gain independence.
“Last year we had one of the best eyeballs.
And my parents wept with joy because they were able to vote, but now we are in prison. ”
Although the Catalan political parties, demanding independence in the regional elections last December and having achieved a close (but important) victory, this year they have not been able to continue successfully. Many of their most famous leaders have themselves gone into exile or are waiting for a re-election.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who is filming a protest in support of the flight by telephone, says politicians on both sides have come to the conflict.
"The situation is getting more and more tense," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial in prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
"The best way to be a candidate for the European elections is to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression shown to us by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry arrests men for driving into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates were damaged.
A crossbow car could have been fired upon.
Meng's goal meant Livingston's victory over the Rangers 1-0
Dolly Menga wins first goal for Livingston
Newcomer Livingston shocked the Rangers and led Steven Gerrard to a second loss in 18 games since taking over as coach of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Meng’s attack proved to be decisive, and Gary Holt’s attack brought him to the other Hibernian.
This is why Gerrard is out in the Premier League this season without a win. He will be led by Hearts ahead of him, eight points behind him.
On the fourth day of the season, the Rangers will welcome Rapid Vieden to the Europa League.
Livingston extended his series of invincibility in the league to six games. Holt, the head coach, who overcame Kenny Miller last month, has not yet tasted the bitterness of his defeat.
Livingston burned the chances against the shouting guests,
Holtov should have been in the lead long before the goal. His primacy made the Rangers no small problems.
Scott Robinson ran ahead, but his attempt passed outside the gate. The end of Alan Lithgow was in the direction of Craig Halkett’s head, which he was picking up at the gate.
And the men of the house calmly left the Rangers to play before them, knowing that they could cause trouble to the guests from the usual situations.
And in the same way the goal that was decided was scored.
And there was a good kick against the Rangers, and it came to pass that Livingstone might be penetrated; and Declan Gallagher and Robinson found Menga, the one with the combination, and he scored from the midst of the treasury.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the ball holding, but they could not overcome home defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was out of work most of the time.
This continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman's attempt was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's legs, and Lithgow finished Livingston's second standard situation at the top.
Livingston's 16th was constantly being directed to the center, and the defense was constantly distracting them. The players demanded a penalty twice – after Halkett's intervention on the middleman Glenn Middleton and after the alleged hand – but the referee allowed the game to continue.
“Phenomenal” Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and result of Livingston.
All the players were as good as one man, but on their way up they did not expect it.
The playing style and the players in the team have not changed at all since they returned to the top of the game. But Holt deserves great credit for what he saw from the time he came.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unbelievable, and he had a very well-organized defense, but Menga would not let Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall finish the fight.
The Rangers, however, ran out of inspiration.
They played very well under Gerrard many times, but they did not reach this level from afar.
They were short of the final score (they had only once defended themselves at home), and the finger of warning was raised for the Rangers, who are in the midst of the tablet.
Not only was Erdogan welcomed warmly in Cologne,
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were raging together in Berlin, and the mood was excellent.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, and the purpose of the visit is to re-establish relations between NATO allies.
The dispute arose because of problems relating to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside of Turkey.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia reported that 25,000 people had been prevented from gathering outside the mosque because of security reasons, but many of the people who were there wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents (many of whom were Kurds) took the lead, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to invite him into the country.
But the oppositions against him show that there are differences of opinion among his guests. Some of the Greek Turks call him a hero, while others condemn him as an autocracy.
Accident on the road in Deptford: the death of a cyclist after a crash with a car
A cyclist was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street. It is a busy road in Deptford in the southeastern part of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics came to the place, but the cyclist was injured and came to the place.
The accident happened only months after another cyclist had been killed by a conductor who had escaped from the scene. The cyclist had been killed in Childers Street about five miles [1.5 km] from the accident on Saturday.
The metropolitan police reported that the police were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is blocked, the bus service is diverted, and the motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Wardens Wounded in Riots
And while there was a riot in the prison of men, six of the guards of the house of the bound were wounded; and the officers of the house of the bound were led astray.
The riots erupted at about 9:30 a.m. British summertime in the British prison of Long Lartin in Worcestershire and continue.
Then those who belonged to the special forces of Tornado were called to the place, so that they might control the riots, and eight prisoners were held responsible, whom they managed to separate into one wing.
And they healed the attendants of the lesser wounds of the face in the place.
A spokesman for the prison administration said: “We have deployed a specially trained prison unit to solve the ongoing incident in the British prison of Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in prisons, but we want to make it clear that we will hand over those who are in charge to the police, and they will be able to stay out of prison for longer. ”
More than 500 prisoners are serving their sentences in Long Lartin prison, including the most dangerous criminals in the land.
In June it was reported that the jailer had ended up in a hospital after he had been attacked by one of the prisoners.
Last year in october an anti-riot unit was called to the prison to end serious riots. The prisoners then attacked the guards with billiard gullies.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to cause severe floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (areas affected by drought can benefit).
The tropical downpour in Arizona is remarkable, but it is also likely to come at the beginning of the coming week. The remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa is directed through the desert southwest, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for areas from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah to return to the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Now it is expected that Rosa will march directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and it will be raining on Monday night.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones within a radius of 320 kilometers from Phoenix have had the status of a tropical storm or a low-pressure storm since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 kilometers of the Arizona Playground.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of ripples, with the Mogollon Rim area in Arizona being up to 15 centimeters in some places.
In the other parts of the desert southwest, the middle of the Rocky Mountains will return, and the Great Pana will likely fall 25 to 50 millimeters, which may be as high as 100 millimeters.
Where there is no flood, there may be profitable rain from the dew, because the drought is troubled by the flood.
Although the floods cause great fear, the rain is likely to be profitable, because the southwest is experiencing a dry season.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is currently facing a minimally extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit the mainland through the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The dew, which still had the strength of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is located 620 kilometers south of the Mexican escapade of Punta Eugenia and is heading north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm hit the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, losing intensity.
Therefore it is expected that when it comes to the land of Mexico on Monday or evening, it will have the strength of a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, the number of bruises may be great, which means that there is a high risk of flooding.
"Between Baja California and Northwestern Sonora, a total of 75 to 150 millimetres is expected, in some places up to 250 millimetres," according to weather.com.
Then the dew will continue as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north, until it reaches the border of Arizona in the early hours of the Tuesday morning as a tropical pressure lower, and then it will go up through Arizona, and on Tuesday evening it will reach southern Utah.
“The greatest danger facing us in connection with Rosa and her remains is the very large number of pupae in Baja California, in the northwest of Sonora, and in the desert southwest of the United States, ” the National Hurricane Center said.
These rains are expected to bring life. Floods are dangerous, floods of water in the desert, and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
There were boys between the ages of 17 and 18, and a 20-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured boy was found on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at approximately 4:00 a.m. British summer time.
He was taken to the hospital and is in a “stabilized” condition.
A boy of 17 years old, two boys of 18 years old, and a man of 20 years old, were kept in the region of Radstock in the night, leading to the plains for the region of Avon and Somerset.
Paul asked all those who had heard the incident by mobile phone to come and speak.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Ugliness and Anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the renunciation of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and disgusting tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the vileness and anger” of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh made a statement before Congress on Thursday, denying Christine Blasey-Ford’s accusation that she had been sexually assaulted as a teenager some ten years ago.
Ford, in conjunction with the charge at the hearing, said the same thing.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people had the opportunity to see Kavanaugh’s uniqueness, character, and courage on that day.”
"The vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is the vote for the confirmation of one of the most respected experts in the law of the present and a lawyer with a perfect history of public service," he told a crowd of his students in West Virginia.
The president made a direct reference to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke of the need for a Republican participation in the elections in the midst of a functional period.
There are still five weeks remaining for the election, which is of the greatest importance in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m actually a candidate,” he said.
"That's why I'm doing my best to support the nominees."
Trump said the Democrats’ goal is to “resist and prevent.”
The Senate's first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place on Friday, a senior Republican party official told CNN.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people. The number of people killed in the earthquake was as high as 100.
At least 384 people were killed and many were swept away by the waves. Huge waves of earthquakes and tsunamis hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on the beach, and the authorities reported it on the Sabbath.
Hundreds of people were gathered at the festival of the beach in the city of Palo on Friday. In the evening they came across the beach with waves as high as six meters. The waves were destroying everything that was standing in their way, and many people came and died.
The tsunami followed the earthquake with a force of 7.5 degrees.
"Yesterday, when the tsunami threatened, the people were still engaged in their activities on the beach, and they did not flee immediately and became victims," Jakarta's Sutopo Purwo Nugro, a spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency (BNPB), said at a briefing in Jakarta.
“She didn’t come by herself with a tsunami, but she carried away cars, beams, and houses, and landed on land, ” Nugro said, adding that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 km/h on the high seas before it hit the beach.
Some of the men tried to escape from the tsunami, but they climbed up on the tree and survived.
Approximately 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pal.
And in the photographs of the air which the agency made public, we see many buildings and shops destroyed, and bridges hidden and thrown down, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Subsequent shocks continued in this coastal town on Saturday.
A few earthquakes were recorded in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by a strong Friday earthquake had exceeded the energy of an atomic bomb matched during World War II in Hiroshima by about 200 times.
The agency reported that the tsunami could have increased the position of the city at the end of the long bay.
And when Nugros had described the damage as “significant, ” he declared that thousands of homes and hospitals and commercial houses and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that the bodies of some of the victims were tied up under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 were wounded and 29 were unfaithful.
Nugros said that the loss of life and the damage to life would be greater in the region of Donggal, which lies 300 km north of Palos, because the region is near the epicentre of the earthquake.
Communications "painfully paralyzed" and from Donggala "are not available for information," Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," he said, "and the Red Cross is being proclaimed, and its workers and volunteers are being sent to the areas that are being affected."
"It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
On the Sabbath the agency was widely criticized for not reporting the tsunami in Palo, but the authorities reported that the waves had arrived at a time when the warning had already been given.
And in the record of the amateurs, which is on the social networks, there was heard a man on the upper floor of the building, crying out in the streets of the city, a great warning, that a tsunami was approaching.
But a few minutes later a wall of water fell on the beach, and it took buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the recording.
And the earthquake and the tsunami caused a great power outage, which cut off the communication with the city of Palu and the surrounding country, and made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue work.
The authorities reported that the army had begun to send out expensive ships from Jakarta and other places to help them. But the evacuees were in dire need of food and other basic supplies.
The city airport was reopened with assistance and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has planned to visit the evacuation centers in Pal to the village.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
The situation is very bad.
But when the workers of the organization of World Vision from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where the workers were hiding in the shelters of the offices in the courtyard, they were passing through the ruined areas, said Doseba.
“They said to me that they had seen many houses destroyed, ” he said.
The situation is very bad.
When the relief groups began to work hard and rebuild after the disaster, some of them complained that foreign aid workers had not been allowed to come to Palo with much experience.
Money and supplies and workers from other parts of the world can come in according to the instructions of Indonesians, only if it is a place of disaster declared to be a national disaster.
That's gone.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Whenever the government says that a disaster is a disaster for a nation, we are able to open the door for international help, but this has not happened. ”
And when the second night came, after the earthquake and the tsunami of Friday, the families and friends of the unfaithful continued to hope for them, that they would come near by a miracle in the cloudy nature of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of the canal.
The rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped by her mother’s body in the rubble for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two unfaithful paragliders at the Asian Games, which ended this month in Indonesia.
Some of the men who stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students. One of them was Mandaga.
“I’ve been doing paragliding for a long time, ” he said,“ and I’m carrying my own emotional burden. ”
Subandono described how, a few hours after the ruin of the Roa Roa Hotel was reported to have flown around the Paragliding community, he was desperately sending WhatsApp administrations to the Pale beach festival participants.
But as he was leading, there appeared but one sign of the beginning of the dimness, rather than two of the blue.
"I think that means that the administrations were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 while filling up an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area
The thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's community worker who replenished an ATM in the Newport on the Levee area on Friday morning, according to the press office of the Newport police department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in this entertainment complex and was about to put in another money, Detective Dennis McCarthy told the administration.
But when he was busy, another man said, “He ran out of the back of the man who worked with Brink’s company, ” and stole the bags with the money to be deposited.
According to the administration of the witness, they found a few suspicious persons who had fled the scene, but the number of those involved in the incident was not known to the police.
If you have any information regarding their identity, please contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper names himself Ye
Kanye West has been named Ye.
On Saturday, when he announced the change on Twitter, he wrote: “The entity officially known as Kanye West.”
For a long time West had been called Yeh, and used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in the month of June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is to present his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she will replace the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled the participation from the "feeling reasons".
In addition to the abbreviation of his current artistic name, West has in the past declared that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said this year as he discussed the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
But from the word of Kanye, which means “one, ” Yea has arisen, reflecting all that is good, evil, confused, and all that is in us.
The album more reflects what we are."
He is still one of the great rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
In the same way, Jay-Z, West’s former co-worker, presents himself in both upper and lowercase letters with his associates.
Mexican President Pledges Not to Use Military Against Civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, as the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never, under any circumstances, use an army to defeat the Mexican people.”
On the 2nd of October 1968 the soldiers were shooting at the peaceful demonstrators in that street, killing as many as 300 people. This was at the time when the leftist student movements began to spread throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans with monthly grants for students and the opening of other free public universities.
He said, “Young people become part of the evil gangs because they don’t have much work and don’t have much opportunity to work.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area, led by investor and promoter of artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who worked in the communities of Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after the various entities of the government of the United States have come into being with skillful intelligence, although the United States does not have a general formal strategy concerning skillful intelligence.
On the contrary, China presented its plan last year: by 2030, it wants to be a leader in innovation in artificial intelligence.
“Since all the rest of the world is far behind the United States and we are trying to make another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence, a double budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, ” said Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the chances of another great success in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" (Superpowers of UI: China, Silicon Valley and the New Order in the World) was published this week by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the general distributor of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one company, Sinovision Ventures.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on the UI system, which beat the highest-rated American player under the name Othello, and later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and general manager of the Chinese subsidiary of Google.
Lee responded to previous U.S. state-of-the-art technological challenges, such as the Robotic Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next one would take place to help unravel future visions.
As Lee said, U.S. diggers often have to work hard to get state grants.
“Academic leaders are not endorsed by China, but by big corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best brains from universities to work on AI for them.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help support the U.S. in AI.
“I think the holders of a PhD in AI should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
The Chinese State Committee released its New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
China’s National Science Foundation (NSF) and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. scholars, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, says Lee.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to bring together partners from the primary and academic communities. The White House announced the creation of the Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
At the same time, this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF, at the same time it invests more than $100 million a year in AI.
On the contrary, in the U.S. legislature, which was trying to create the National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence, the desired activity has not been carried out for a whole month.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonia's citizens voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the name of the country to "Republic of North Macedonia," a move that would resolve a dispute with Greece over a ten-year ban on Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments drafted an agreement in June overshadowed the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign raised doubts about whether participation would reach the minimum 50 percent needed to make the referendum valid.
The question on the referendum ballot was: “Are you a member of the European Union and NATO through the recognition of the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?”
Proponents of the change of name of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev argue that this is a price that is worth allowing Macedonia, the country that emerged after the disappearance of Yugoslavia, to communities such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to choose a future for the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they may live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us, ” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a large number of members of parliament have declared that they will respect the will of the electorate and decide according to the outcome.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission announced that there were no irregularities in the referendum until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I have come to choose for my children, ” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in Skopje,“ our place is in Europe.
Macedonian MP Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their ballots in a Macedonian referendum on the change of the name of the country, thanks to which it could join NATO and the European Union, in the Macedonian city of Strumica on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a small podium in front of parliament in Skopje and brought chairs to the tents built by the rebels who wanted to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads up, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"We may be a poor country, but we have our own dignity.
If they refuse to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become a member of the Eurasian integration. ”
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership brings the necessary investment to Macedonia, which has a non-representative level of more than 20 percent.
"I am convinced that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after he put in his ballot.
He added that the resulting “yes” would be “an affirmation of our future.”
Prieskum, which was announced last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Affairs, said that 30 to 43 percent of voters were going to the referendum – which is below the threshold of the necessary participation.
Another Prieskum, realized by the Macedonian TV station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote.
Of those asked, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be successful, participation must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A sluggish referendum would mark the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policies since it took the lead in May last year.
Look: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City crosses the entire defense of Brighton and goal scorer
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, broke the lightning defense and claimed a 2-0 victory for Manchester City.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy at first.
The Argentinian striker received a midfield pass at the start of the action.
And piercing through the midst of the three defenders of Brighton, he ran out into the open field.
Then Aguero was surrounded by four green robes.
And having pressed along one of the defenders, he went around several others at the edge of the block of Brighton.
He sent the pass to the left where the ball found Sterling.
The Englishman touched the ball for the first time and sent it back to Aguer, who right-handedly defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguera has the same foot problems," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that's exactly how it hurt.
We were lucky to have a goal at that moment.”
But it was Sterling who won the Cityzens an opening advantage in the Premier League.
His goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got to the ball deep in Brighton territory during this game.
And he sent out a beautiful song along the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane touched the ball a few times and led Sterling toward a distant herd.
The Cityzens attacker hit the ball close to the net before it slipped into the car.
City prepares for a match against Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Masters League on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin his chances for the Rockies
And when the Nationals fell out of the playoffs, there was not much reason to be compelled to go any further.
But Scherzer, who is very hard-fought, hopes to stand up against the Colorado Rockies in a straitjacket, though the consequences may yet be for the Rockies, who are ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West Division.
With a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies retained at least the wild card option, but they still have to confirm their first division title.
For if we play nothing, at least we are still in a hurry, thinking that in the atmosphere here at Denver, with such a crowd and opponent, this will be the highest level that we will reach this year.
“Of course I want to experience it.”
The Nationals have not yet appointed the first pitcher in the field, but in all respects they are clearly letting Scherzer be pitched in such a situation.
But Scherzer, for whom it was the 34th time, put in a bullpen on the fourth day, and cast it out in the crowd, while the wave was running on the day of rest.
The Washington right hand has a balance of 18-7 with a score of 2.53 ERA and 300 strike-outs for 220 2/3 changes this season.
Trump at a meeting in West Virginia
The President pointed to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, when he discussed the reason for the Republicans’ participation in the midterms.
“In November everything we have received will be on strike.
There are five weeks remaining for the most important decisions of our lives.
This is a great opportunity, a great opportunity. Even though I myself am not a candidate, I am actually a candidate. Therefore I am going down to the country fighting for our excellent candidates. ”
Trump continued, “You see that terrible, really terrible, radical group of Democrats. It’s happening right in front of our eyes.
They are determined to gain authority over themselves through all sorts of vileness and wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overcome, so that they can have power and control. They want to do this, they want to have power and control, but we won’t give them that. ”
And he said to them, The democrats have gone forth to oppose and to forbid.
“You could see it in the last four days, ” he said, calling the Democrats ‘ angry, vile, evil, and liars. ’
As the Senate Judiciary Committee has said, appoint Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who was met with a loud outcry from the audience.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you escape the document?
Um, um, what?
No, um, no, I, wait--her body's word was truly evil--the body's worst word I have ever seen."
The Labour Party is ceasing to be liberal.
They do not tolerate those who speak their own language.
When the activists of Momentum voted in favour of my rebuke, I was hardly surprised.
Finally, I am the last one in the council of Labour MPs who have been told that he is no longer welcome — all because of an opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joanna Ryana, has been treated in a similar way, because she has stood firm against anti-Semitism.
In my case, having been rebuked, he criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
It was about the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically, about similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with the previous leaders.
In an invitation to the Labour Party's seating for Nottingham on Friday, it was said that "we want to make the seating inclusive and productive."
After most of my eight years in office as a Labour MP, the GC's Friday evening seats were exactly the same.
For God’s sake, many things today are not going to happen in this way, and the promise of a “softer and gentler ” policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever came true.
Increasingly, differences of opinion are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged according to the good conduct of the party.
This began shortly after Jeremy had come to his senses, because my colleagues, who I had previously thought would share a similar political position, were all at once expecting me to turn 180 degrees and adopt opinions that I would otherwise never agree with, whether on national security or on the single market.
Whenever I speak in public, and there is essentially one thing I say, there follows a tirade of criticism in the social media, calling for an appeal, giving in to a politician in the midst, and listening as if I were not in the Labour Party.
And this is not my only temptation.
Of course, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because comments made on me tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues, who every day face the thunder of sexist or racist attacks and never hide from them.
One of the greatest disappointments of this political age is the degree to which the level of attacks has normalized.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn argued that the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
For we are no longer the liberals of this fame, and every time there is a wave of disobedience or a change of policy, the party shrinks more and more.
For the last two years I have been told by a large crowd not to say too much, but to keep quiet and to keep my footsteps. Then I will be fine.
But for this I did not go into politics.
When I entered the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, provoked by the flattery of Thatcher’s government, which had let my high school class literally collapse, I tried to educate better public servants to those who were most in need, whether they were on the council or on the council.
I have never concealed my policy, not even in the last election.
No one in the district of Nottingham East has been able to be confused by my political views and my opposition to the current leadership.
To those who supported me on Friday, I would like to say this only: If the country is moving toward Brexit, which will hurt the households, businesses, and our public services, I do not understand the desire to spend my time and energy on the loyalty of the leader of the Labour Party.
But the main message I have is not to initiate a momentum in Nottingham. I am not afraid of all of you, whether you are members of the Labour Party or not. I am proud that I have been able to serve you, and I promise you that I will appeal to you, or that I will be politically motivated.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr gets to the top
Two short attempts may have swayed the final result, but it is no wonder that Ayr deserved a triumph in this amazingly difficult day of the Tennent's Premiership.
And now he was found on the top of the tablet, as the only one not having been beaten by him out of ten.
Finally, a great defense came to their home, and a better use of opportunities, and Peter Murchie, the trainer, has full right to joy.
He said, “We have been tested many times over the course of our fights, and we are still unbeaten, so I must be happy. ”
Then Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Ayer, they have taken a better chance than we have. ”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute to change Frazier Climo led Ayr into the lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was released by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to count, and Jason Baggot wrote down the unchanged attempt.
Climo punished the conduct of Ayr with a penalty, and then, precisely at half-time, scored by a solo attempt, thanks to which Ayr could go to a break with the result of 17-5.
But Melrose began the second half well, and the attempt of Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the division to five points.
And there followed a prolonged delay, because of the severe injury of Ruaridh Knott, who had been removed. And as soon as the game began, Ayr was led by the temptation of Stafford McDowall, who changed Climo.
Ayr's managing captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and Melrose took advantage of it in the form of Bruce Colvin's unchanging attempt at the end of the encounter under intense pressure.
But the home side came to life again. And when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for hitting Clima without a ball, MacPherson got a touch-down from the penalty shootout with the approaching horde of Ayr behind his back.
Climo changed, much like at the beginning of the action, then, as Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's box kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing away at the fifth attempt of the household.
The star of the series Still Game is launching a new career in gastronomy
The star of the British series Still Game, Ford Kieran, is clearly starting a career in the field of services. According to our information, he was appointed the director of the company with a license to conduct restauration.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes and plays alongside his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the upcoming ninth series would be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life outside the Glasgow suburb of Craiglang.
According to official records, Adriftmorn Limited is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source told Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "transformative restorative business."
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, cut off from the sea, hopes to regain access to the Pacific Ocean
The sailors are wearing the sails of the command of the sea in La Paz.
Blue flags are flying on public buildings.
From the lake of Titicaca to the Amazon, the seas are marked with the motto: “The sea is our right.
And it is our duty to take it back. ”
In all of Bolivia, cut off from the sea, the memory of the coastline lost in Chile’s bloody conflict in the 19th century is still alive – just as the desire to revisit the waters of the Pacific Ocean.
Now the hope is high for the last ten years. After five years of deliberation, Bolivia is expected on the first day of October by a decision of the international court of justice.
“Bolivia is on the rise, it has a spirit of unity and balance and, of course, it believes in a positive outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the international court in large screens throughout the country, hoping that the tribunal at The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, so that after ten years of intermittent years Chile will be required to negotiate a sovereign approach to the sea of Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who will take part in the controversial fight for re-election next year, has the same thing to say about Monday’s decision.
"Our return to the Pacific Ocean is within reach," he said at the end of August.
Some analysts, however, believe that it is unlikely that a judgment will be passed on Bolivia, and if yes, much will not change.
A UN body based in the Netherlands does not have the authority to grow Chinese territory, and has said it will not determine the outcome of any yearly events.
The fact that the judgment of the international court comes six months after hearing the arguments of the parties, indicates that the case was not “complicated, ” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chinese expert in international law.
And while there is no doubt about the Bolivian arguments, it is possible that she has taken a step back in recent years.
"The government of Bolivia at the same time has taken possession of the question of access to the sea," said Zarate.
Morales's aggressive rhetoric undermined all the heightened hostility of Chile, she said.
And Bolivia and Chile will continue to have their work done in one day, but after that it will be very difficult to maintain a handiwork.
The regions have not been represented by ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, has dismissed the idea that the court's decision would be unusually quick.
He said, “It will be an opportunity for Bolivia to open up a new era of relations with Chile. It will be an opportunity to finish 139 years without delay, and to gain each other’s advantage. ”
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the navy issue as a political barrage.
"Bolivia will never give up her right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“This decision is an opportunity for us to realize that we must go beyond the past. ”
North Korea refuses nuclear disarmament until the United States can believe it
The North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says that his country will not get rid of its nuclear weapons before it can trust Washington.
Ri appeared at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made during the Singapore summit among rival leaders.
Its rise comes at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic talks on the nuclear issue with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ri says it's an illusion to think that the continued US sanctions and protests against a declaration that would end the Korean War could bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang taking major steps toward disarmament first.
Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
There is, however, a general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which it is likely to see as the only means of guaranteeing its security in the country.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump.
The fashionable things of Paris show the latest trends in impressive headgear, which you will soon find in your store
If you want to expand your collection of hats or keep yourself completely away from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne revealed in their spring/year 19 collection a whole range of unusual oversized headgear that outraged viewers at the Paris Fashion Week.
Highly impractical hats flooded Instagram this year, and these designers sent their shocking creations to the show moolo.
Valentine’s unique gift was a large, beige hat adorned with a feathered roof that covered the heads of model women.
And other additions of exceeding greatness were a melon overlaid with precious stones, and a witch’s hat, and pineapple, which were not meant to make you warm.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre massages – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the coloured masks had their feathers sewn up and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
The one piece was like diving gear, snorkels, and eyeglasses. But the other piece looked like a spout of melted ice cream.
And if you like bold fashionable speeches – you are lucky.
The experts in the staves are predicting that huge hats will go into the stores around you.
The oversized hats follow the inspiration of "La Bomba", a straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide roof, worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowska.
And the sign of the cult standing behind the highly impractical hat, which was lurking behind every corner of the social media, sent to the moor another great creature, a straw-sack, almost as great as the model in her bathing-cloth.
The raffia bag of burnt orange paint, framed with raffia straps and complemented by a white leather ear, was a unique piece of the La Riviera spring/year 19 collection from the Jacquemus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect a large hat and a beach bag to come into the shops next year. Since the designer has had such a great influence, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories. ”
John Edward: Without language skills, a global citizen can't do anything
Scottish independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this trend continues in 2018 with another year of extraordinary results of trials, further strengthening individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
With more than 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), seek to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
The independent schools seek to prepare the disciples for further and higher education, a career according to their positions, and a place in the world as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement school curricula to measure, we still see modern languages as a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “When you speak to a man in a language he understands, you are speaking to his head.
When you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart. ”
A strong reminder is this: If we want to build up a relationship of confidence with people from other parts of the world, we cannot rely on English alone.
This year’s test results show that the languages at the top of the tablet are the most popular among independent schools.
In total, up to 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are teaching foreign languages as basic skills that children and young people will need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as subjects of choice in independent and other schools as equally important as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics).
In 2014, the Commission's Employment and Skills Survey of the UK found that 17 per cent of the reasons cited by the employers as problems in the occupation of workplaces represented language insufficiency.
For this reason, the ability to speak is becoming more and more necessary in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more promising job opportunities arise that require languages, these abilities become essential in a globalised world.
No matter what career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a future advantage in this lifelong learning.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically bring an advantage over the competition to a Viatius-speaking person.
According to YouGov’s parable, among the more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak the languages they wanted in order to have a smooth conversation, and French was the only language in which a large number of people received double-digit percentiles.
Therefore it is better for the children of this day to invest in the teaching of tongues.
Knowledge of many languages, especially those of developed countries, will give children a better chance to find meaningful employment.
In the province of Scotland, every school will be different from the one taught in different languages.
Some schools look to the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered the most important for the United Kingdom in terms of the future in 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child may be interested in, let him choose from among the many tongues in independent schools, being taught by experts in that field.
The independent schools of Scotland have committed themselves to providing educational facilities that will prepare the children and equip them with the necessary skills to thrive, so that the future may bring.
At the same time, there is no denying that in the global business environment tongues are still of paramount importance for the future of the country, which must be reflected in the education.
Modern languages should in fact be called "international communicative faculties."
Furthermore, for the sake of the young people in Scotland, the independent schools will offer these opportunities, diversity and excellence.
Il faut bien le faire.

LeBron is about to make his debut in San Diego.
Now the fans who are looking forward to LeBron James’s first game for the Los Angeles Lakers will be waiting for a while.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But it is not clear how long he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would play a limited number of minutes.
After the training began this week, James made a statement about his plans for the Lakers' six games of preparation.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need any more pre-matches,” he said.
Trump's meetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a series of campaign meetings in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s planned meetings to return next week to stops in benevolent places, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Having abstained from voting for his vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is planning to build support for the upcoming midterms, because Republicans are in danger of losing control in November.
What time is Trump’s meeting in West Virginia today, and where can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, takes place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s West Virginia event online at a lower level, via a live stream on YouTube.
It is likely that Trump will come forward to the current hearing of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who has been strained over sexual harassment charges, with the expected confirmation of the Senate vote postponed to Sunday.
But the first purpose of this series of meetings is above all to help the republicans, who are waiting for the difficult November elections, to regain their strength.
According to the news agency Reuters, then, these five meetings are to be held on the coming week, to “exhort volunteers and followers, because the Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and in the House of Representatives.
“Congress control is so critical to his agenda that when he enters a busy election season, the president will travel to as many states as possible,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Today's meeting, held at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could attract supporters from "Ohia and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgh media," West Virginia Metro News reported.
Trump on Saturday will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month. It is a state in which he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to support the Republican nominee for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, whose preferences are lagging behind in the debates.
"For Morrisey, it's not a good sign that the president has to come to raise his preferences in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: By doing so, the US demonstrates courage in the fight and hopes for success in entering into indiscriminate individual fights
After three one-sided series, the foursomes will be able to get exactly what this Ryder Cup needs on Saturday.
The swinging pendulum of the momentum is an invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in this type of competitions.
Where, then, is the moving force now found according to them?
“They were six points ahead of us, but now they are only four, ” said Jordan Spieth,“ so we can say that we have a moderate momentum now. ”
Europe, of course, has an advantage, a four-point lead, and another twelve in the game.
But as Spieth says, the Americans have a gentle wind in their sails, and they have many reasons for hope, except one, which is like Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day long, each scoring three points out of the four.
But Spieth was invincible from the depth of the pit to the last pit, leading the rest by his example.
And as his round progressed, the cries of the head of the feast grew louder, and he sank the key-stitch, and the fourth contest was inconclusive, when he and Thomas had two by two.
His putt, which had won them a match of 15, was glorified with a similar cry, which proves his conviction that the American is not yet lost in the tumult.
He said, “You have to put your hands on each other and start thinking about your own struggles. ”
There is nothing left for any of the players.
18 holes in which you must reach the maximum.
The only players who scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unscrupulous favorites of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but charming European couple having four out of four, has no way to make a mistake.
And there were only two who did not shoot a bogey on the sabbath in the afternoon, but shunned it on the sabbath also in the morning, and at the feast on Friday, and at the other nine holes on the morning.
This round, and the energy flowing between the tumultuous mob and the players, confirms that these players will need to be defeated in the field, and it is difficult to find a more popular player to consolidate the potential European victory at sunset over the Iirisque of Le Golf National or Fleetwood.
The best of both at the same time on different holes.
But the words about the glory of the European Union are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the hero of early-fourball, when he played alongside Alex Noren.
And one bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes dug out a pit for the Spaniard and the Swede, from which they were no longer able to dig.
There is no one here who will help you get out of the pit.
But the fights of fourball and foursome are close to each other. They are fascinating because of the interactions between the two, the counsels they follow, the counsels they do not follow, and the way in which the strategy can be thought of for a minute.
Europe has played its best so far, and on the final day it is well behaved, but these foursomes have shown in the same way that by this the United States is not afraid to fight, of which some, especially in the continent of America, have doubted.
On the day of the Ryder Cup final, Europe takes the lead 10:6
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing Saturday's matches of fourball and foursome with the lead against the United States 10-6.
The encouraged duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack, with two victories over the tormenting Tiger Woods, to credit four points to their Le Golf National account.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, trying to keep the trophy, which she lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated the sloppy American side in the morning fourball matches and won the series 3-1.
In the foursomes, the Americans offered more resistance, they won two matches, but they could not keep their deficit.
Jim Furyk's party needs eight points out of 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while Molinari and Molliwood, nicknamed Molliwood, are the second two to win four points in their opening four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
After shattering Woods and Patrick Reed in fourball matches, they remarkably consolidated their performance and defeated depressed Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau for even more powerful 5&4s.
Woods, who had two games on the Sabbath, showed occasional flashes of brilliance, but in the end he lost 19 of his 29 matches, fourball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who missed the early fourball games, returned to accompany Henrik Stenson in the foursome, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, a unit and a trio in the world rib.
But it was not easy for Europe on a pleasant day, which was bright southwest of Paris.
Three-time prominent winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They earned a savage 2&1 win over Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball games and then returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome after losing the opening two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team managed to get out of the four-point deficit when entering individual matches, although Fury's side, as a defender of the title, only needs a draw to maintain the trophy.
After they had been in a different place for two whole days, a direct attack seems to be more obvious than their strength.
North Korea won’t be able to arm itself without confidence if it wants to.
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions had overcame distrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Institute’s annual general meeting that North Korea had taken “substantial steps” over the past year, such as installing nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site, and ensuring that nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons were not expanded.
"But we don't see any response from the United States," he added.
saying, “Without all confidence in the United States, it will not come to our national security, for under such circumstances it has been excluded that we should be the first to arm ourselves with one arm. ”
As Ri reiterated North Korea's known hesitation against Washington's gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be rewarded in step-by-step steps, his position was fundamental in that he did not immediately notice unilateral nuclear disarmament in Pangang.
Ri referred to the joint position issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the all-out first summit between the current US President and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on the “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” that Trump promised North Korea security assurances.
North Korea sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that Pyongyang must first surrender its nuclear weapons.
In the same way, Washington refused to impose severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists first on nuclear disarmament and is increasing the level of tension through sanctions, in order to achieve their purpose by coercive means, and finally by advocating a 'declaration of an end to the war,'" Ri said.
saying, “Sanctions will make us fall on our knees. This is a delusion of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that the ongoing sanctions are exacerbating our mistrust."
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump, which the US president told the United Nations earlier this week.
But the minister stressed three encounters between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months, adding: "If the other side of the nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea instead of the United States, disarming the Korean Peninsula would not have ended."
However, Ri’s tone differed drastically from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the U.S.’s use of North Korean missiles was inevitable after Trump called Kim a “missile on a suicide mission.”
This year, Trump, who threatened last year to “totally destroy North Korea,” praised Kim at the UN for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said he still had a lot of work to do and sanctions had to stay until North Korea was stripped of its nuclear weapons.
Trump said he had no timetable, saying "it doesn't matter if it takes two, three years or five months."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the application of the Security Council's sanctions must continue strictly and without exception until we have achieved complete, final and certified nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and subsequently announced that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo had already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
He was leaving Pyongyang in the summer, thinking that progress had been made, but North Korea condemned him a few hours later because he had done “gangsterish things. ”
North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile test site and the nuclear complex this month after meeting with Moon if the United States received "appropriate care."
According to what he had said, Kim told him that the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and his steps toward a normalization of relations with Washington were “just the precautions he expected to take. ”
Harvard students take a course on how to breathe enough
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is for all students to get more sleep in an effort to curb the growing trend of studying all night long with caffeine.
Scientists have found that students at the world’s leading university are often helpless when it comes to the complete foundations of health care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist in the Brigham and Women’s Clinics, has developed a course that is the first of its kind in the United States.
He began his work on the subject of sleep deprivation and its effect on the teaching.
“At the end a girl came to me and said, ‘ Why do I need to know this now, in the last year? ’
She claimed that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which took place this year for the first time, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and sports performance while improving overall health.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard School of Medicine and executive riadist of the university’s medical service, said the university had decided to open the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the work week.
The hourly rate encompasses a series of interactive tasks.
In one part there is a picture of a boarding school where students can click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books, and learn about the effects of caffeine, light and how lack of sleep affects sports performance and how important is regular sleep.
The rest will learn how a long-term sleep deficit can increase the risk of heart attack, death, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university campus with interactive icons further encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the management of students at once.
But we believe they have a right to know about it – just as everyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Czeisler added.
There is still a culture in which students are proud to have been able to teach all night, he says, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation has become a growing problem.
Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said – even against weight gain, because sleep deficits get the brain into starvation mode, so they constantly have a feeling of hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his seminars last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and instigated him to try to retrain the course at the university level.
He hopes that in the next step it will be possible to ask all the postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before embarking on a difficult study.
Prof. Czeisler advises students to set their alarm clocks for the time they are to go to bed, and for the time they are to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light," which light up electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, which can lead to a problem with your circadian rhythm.
Livingston 1 : 0 Rangers: Meng's goal sank Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another round of grief outside the game when Dolly Menga was convicted by the shots fired by Steven Gerrard to a 1–0 draw in Livingstone.
The guests of Ibrox tried to record their first victory outside of the February triumph of 4:1 in St Johnstone, but in doing so Gary Holt brought Gerrard only his second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team at a position of 8 points from the leaders of the Premier League table Hedshike Ladstone.
Menga scored seven minutes before half-time, and Rangers, who lacked intelligence, did not even come close to settling down.
But when the Rangers had fallen to the sixth place, Livingston went up to the third place, and fell behind the Hibernians with a goal difference.
And there may be other difficulties for Rangers, even as Calum Spence, the conciliator, was wounded in the head, because he was struck by an object which was evidently thrown out of the court to the guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, and then the Rangers crossed Ayr and reached the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt left behind the eleventh share of Levi, who had taken away the point of Hearts last week. He was thrilled at the way his well-behaved team strangled their opponents in every act.
The Rangers may have dominated the ball holding, but Livingston was more active when he got to the ball.
They were to score only in the second game. Meng had already been called back from England. He had sent Scott Pittman to the gates of Allan McGregor. But the Pole had lost his chance.
After a long kick, Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, was able to pass the rear bar from a distance.
The Rangers took control, but in the final third they seemed to have hope rather than confidence.
Alfredo Morelos claimed a penalty after a quarter of an hour's play when he fell against Steven Lawless, but the referee Steven Thomson rejected the Colombian's desire.
The Rangers fired only two shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely got the head of Lassan Coulibaly and the meek arrow of Ovie Ejari out of the way.
Even though the goal that Levi scored in the 34th season might have been at odds with the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
The Rangers again failed to cope with Jacobs' horn.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher moved the ball with a slit to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool head and chose Menga for a simple finish.
While Gerrard was on his way, he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had a near-immediate effect, when the wingman found Morelos, but the mighty Kelly hurried out of his wits and blocked him.
But Livingston forced the guests to play the exact game they liked when Lithgow and Halkett shot one long ball after the other.
Holt's side could have pushed its lead in the final stages, but McGregor defended Jacobs well and then resisted Lithgow's wide head from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, Rangers’ deputy, later made a complaint about his involvement with Jacobs, but Thomson overlooked it again.
The Inventor of Geiger's Computer
And now here we have a page from our illegitimate early chronicle: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago... that was the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually refined the device known as Geiger's computer.
Geiger's computer, in addition to being an inseparable consummation of science to this day, has become a staple of popular culture when it is described in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" by leading cowboys Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s Geiger’s computer, it scans for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
And when you put on your ears, you really hear the sound of the atoms, which produce radioactivity in the minerals. ”
Evans: “I can hear them crackling! ”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Weight Loss Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Your Immune System to “See” Weight Loss Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize weight-loss cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
And they see the protein running around in many kinds of cancer, and they will stumble back
The vaccine tested shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize weight-loss cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
In this way the immune cells of the patient are extracted, and they are prepared in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein that runs in many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are pushed back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of several types of cancer" of returned breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar approach to endorsing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to treat cancer cells worked in the treatment of the same type of leukemia.
Kanye West with a MAGA cap on his head became a target of criticism for supporting Trump after appearing on Saturday Night Live.
Didn't like it good
Kanye West was squealed in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show after a chaotic performance in which he chanted US President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
When he finished his third song, called Ghost Town, while he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Great, he launched an attack against the Democrats and expressed his support for Trump.
“I have talked to a white man many times, and he said to me, ‘ How can you accept Trump because he is a racist? ’
But if I were afflicted with racism, I would have withdrew from America long ago. ”
The Saturday Night Live (SNL) show began with a scene with Matt Damon in which a Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although West's speech wasn't broadcast, comedian Chris Rock made it public on social media.
It was not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh with his build.
And in the same way, West complained to the audience, because he had had a hard time behind the scenes because of his cap.
"I was bullied behind the scenes.
They told me, ‘Don’t go there with that cap on your head.’
I've been bullied!
And then they told me that I was of the day," said the Washington Examiner.
West said, “Do you want to see what day I am? I will put on my coat, which means no one will tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
And his comments were received by the audience at least twice, and the rest of those in the assembly were perplexed, and Variety's magazine was misled, with one saying to the media, "The whole study was silent."
West was summoned as an imminent replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
And the West was astonished at many, when it performed the song I Love it, clothed as the waters of Perrier.
West was backed by TPUSA leader Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “A link for one of the bravest souls: THE GIRL THAT YOU AGAINST DAWN.”
But talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West "was simply himself and that's totally amazing."
“But I am determined NOT to change someone (by buying his music, his clothing brand, or by promoting his ‘knowledge’) who I am convinced accepts and promotes an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
"We are the same," she added.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and from now on would be "Ye", formally known as Kanye West.
He was not the first artisan to change his name, but he followed in the footsteps of Diddi, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffa, and P Diddy.
His colleague, rapper Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and there is, of course, the departed evil legend Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to an artist, formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington condemns toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-armed Jon Snow in the rugged mid-century fantasy series Game of Thrones from HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor condemned the stereotype of the hero and said that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be seen on screen.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said that “something has eluded him and he is considering how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, having recently married Rose Leslie, a fellow Game of Thrones, the same 31-year-old, said that the solution to this problem was “very important. ”
He said, “It is very important for me to find out where something has gone out of our way in the mask. ”
saying, “What do we teach men when they are growing up, when there is a problem, which we now see? ”
Kit is convinced that television is partly responsible for the growth of toxic masculinity because of its obsessive masculinity.
And he said, What is born, and what is taught?
“What does television teach in the streets that young boys feel they must have this kind of masculinity?
I think this is indeed one of the great questions of our time, how shall we change this?
For it is clear that something has gone out of the way among the young men. ”
In the interview, he also admitted that when the series ends next year, he will no longer be filming lustful prologues or the sequel to Game of Thrones, because “he is finished with battles and horses.”
From November, Kit will play in a new adaptation of the game Sam Shepard True West, which is a story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the TV series Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife through this show, ” he said,“ so she has given me a certain sense of what will happen to my family and what will happen to my life. ”
In the fantasy series crowned with the Emmy Awards, Rose Ygritte, the love of the Whale character, played by John Snow.
The couple were reunited in June 2018 at the home of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, more than 40,000 new cases were reported.
Now the greater part of the new things were transferred sexually, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who became infected with HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, and the officials of the Chinese health service brought them to a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still widespread.
According to conservative studies, 70-90% of men who have had sex with their husbands will eventually marry their wives.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from a lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV cures as part of an effort to address this problem.
Maxine Waters argues that an employee would let him escape GOP senators’ data, criticizing “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. lawmaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that a member of her staff would send personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to the Wikipedia page of a lawmaker.
A Democrat for Los Angeles says the charges come from “ultra-right” experts and web sites.
"Lies, lies and other detestable lies," Waters said in a tweet.
The leaked information reportedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The news was released online on Thursday by an unknown person at Capitol Hill as a Senate jury was being questioned over allegations of sexual harassment against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
But the same time three senators questioned Kavanaugh, and they passed away.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the leaks were linked to Waters' office and provided information about a member of Waters' staff, Hill said.
"This unconfirmed accusation is completely false and absolutely false," Waters continued.
saying, “A member of my staff whose identity and personal information and security have been compromised by such deceitful and false accusations has not been responsible for leaking such information in any way.
This unconfirmed accusation is wholly untrue and absolutely false.”
Waters's announcement quickly drew criticism online, with the exception of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"Her support is full of anger," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she has no appropriate temperament to be a member of Congress.
If a man is accused of anything he has not done, he must not be provoked.
It is not right to be rebellious.
He must not question the accuser's motives.
He has to be calm and balanced.”
Fleischer evidently compared Waters' reaction to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, the Republican nominee for Waters' nominee, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's great," he wrote.
Waters said in her statement that she had been informed by the Chancellery of the fraudulent claims made by the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies.
"We will see to it that they do what is revealed," she said, "and they will be held accountable for what they have done, which is destructive and dangerous to all my staff."
Review of Johnny English hits again – a sub-dimensioned spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now time to look for references to Brexit in every new British-looking film, and this is also true of this reincarnation of the action comedy parody with Johnny English – which was first shown in the 2003 Johnny English movie and came to life in the 2011 Johnny English movie.
Shall we become ironic in our self-satisfaction as to how clearly we are incapable of the new national export products?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his expressive facial expressions, has been given the opportunity to revisit everything, and his name signifies better than any other that he is a generous comic created especially for non-English audiences.
He is, of course, the clumsy undercover agent, who, despite his bizarre claim to gentle charm, has a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean, and a sliver of that man who arrived with a single tone for the opening melody of the Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
He was originally born out of a traveling international and mysterious man, whom Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten television commercials of Barclaycard, leaving chaos everywhere behind.
In this last adventure of Johnny English, you can find one or two pleasant moments.
I liked how Johnny English came to a helicopter dressed in a mid-century turban, and a propeller struck his helmet gently.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy is evident here, but humor is a little subdimensioned and especially superficial, especially since “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now offering comedy as one of their vaults.
The humor works as if it were aimed at children rather than at adults. For me, the adventures of Johnny English are not as inventive and as conceited as the gags of Atkinson without words in the image of Mr. Bean.
The current background of the story of the film is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret web of spies and revealed the identities of all the British agents in the area as a serving agent, Kevin Eldon, who has escaped a minor role.
This is the last hurdle for the Prime Minister, who is a pompous and warlike figure who is already on the verge of collapse because of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing what she can with a figure like Teresa May, but she has nothing to work with.
Her advisors inform her that if every active spy has been betrayed, she will have to summon someone in a hurry.
So Johnny English himself is coming to the scene. He has been hired today as a steward in a fancy institution. He teaches private lessons about how to become a secret spy. Some of the gags are very nice to him, just as English teaches the lessons of espionage in the School of Rock.
So when the Englishmen are called back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, they will meet with Bough, their former long-time swindler, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bough is now a married man, attached to an affected submarine commander, whose role Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a pity.
So Batman and Robin, who are masters of disasters in the secret service of His Majesty, are back in the field, running into the beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bullet, by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volt is played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough are beginning to fight in an odious way. They are going to set fire to what has become a French restaurant. They are going to set fire to what has become a French restaurant. They are going to put on the luxury yacht of Volt. English is going to unleash pure anarchy when the temptation comes.
All tricks come out of the sleeve in the last minutes, but in any way they can be violent and violent, as though they are a little like the television program for children.
The whole impression is more or less primed.
And as with the other films with Johnny English, I still have to think, why doesn't the British film premise give Rowan Atkinson a final role that fits his talent?
The Labour Party rejects the work of a four-day workweek in Britain, which was paid for on a five-day basis.
For Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party should consider a radical plan, according to which the British should have a four-day work week, but receive a wage of five days.
The party allegedly wants the leadership of the communities to redistribute the savings generated by the revolution into artificial intelligence (AI) to give workers a day off.
It would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend, but they would carry the same paychecks home.
Sources say the idea would be “responsible” to the party’s economic plans to tilt the landscape to the benefit of the workers.
The passage to the four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions, in order that the workers might benefit from economic changes.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “We expect the evaluation of the proposal to be made public by the end of the year.
“It will not happen in the evening or in the morning, but the four-day work week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers, as well as with the party’s overall strategy.”
Labour would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party won a four-day work week for its election campaign in 2017.
But the Labour Party as a whole does not put the effort forward.
The spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The Labour Party’s polling week is not the party’s policy, nor is the party considering it.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Now the Lord McDonnell has shown his determination to obtain power again from those who are “anonymous peddlers, ” and from those who are“ rich ” in the ministry.
At the same time, the plans of the shadow office mean that the current shareholders in the water companies would not get their full share back, because the Labour government could use “collisions” on account of a real crime.
At the same time, he confirmed plans to recruit employees for the companies’ shows and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, so that the 10 percent of the private sector’s firium will reach employees, who could earn annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discuss whether the FBI’s investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court at least for the week, and raised the question of whether the bureau's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, the 60 Minutes program's rapporteur, Scott Pelley, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything to change their minds about.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course," Kennedy said.
“As I was going to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when the charges were brought, and said, “Did you do this? ”
He was determined, determined, and unequivocal.”
But Graham's voice seems to be firmly established.
“I have already decided on Brett Kavanaugh, ” he said,“ and there must be some serious charge against him. ”
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett strongly denied everything, ” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And no one whom he names can confirm this.
That thing is 36 years old.
I don’t see how anything can change. ”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how does it contribute to reducing poverty?
On the Sabbath day there will be a Global Citizen Festival in New York. It is a yearly celebration of evil things. A large crowd of stars will be there. They will have an even more powerful mission: to end the world’s famine.
In their seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy artisans like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real body of enterprise that is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, held for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If the audience wants to receive a ticket for free (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), they must complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to the world leader, making a phone call, or otherwise making sense.
Now there are still twelve years to go. How long will it take for Global Citizen to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea of rewarding people with free concerts in a way that is appropriate to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicivism” – when do people feel that they really get a change when I sign an online petition or tweet?
Global Citizen claims to have seen more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011 to pursue different goals.
Organizers say the shares helped stir up world leaders to announce pledges and policies worth more than $37 billion that would affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group reported that 390 pledges and pledges were received from its shares, with at least $10 billion already paid or collected.
The group estimates that the resources available so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the pledges are, for example, The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of 700 UK-based investors and contractors committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million in cash to help end the crisis.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make malnutrition a thing of the past,” said Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also noted that after more than 5,000 actions calling for better nutrition for mothers and children in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutition project, which will provide 5 million women and children with nutrition contributions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and difficult journey—sometimes we’re going to fall and drift.
But as with the great agitation of the rights of the people against apartheid that is before us, we prosper, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e, among the personalities performing at this year's event in New York, along with moderators Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy as a “blockade” to curb Russian energy exports, says interior secretary
“If necessary,” Washington can summon its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the markets of the Middle East, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke pointed out that Russia’s involvement in Syria – where they are acting at the invitation of a legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I am convinced that the main reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to sell their energy there, just as they are doing in eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe. ”
For there are certain ways and methods of dealing with him.
"The United States can use the navy to ensure that the sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants in the venture, which is being held under the auspices of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is posing as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He also compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they were essentially the same.
“The economic opportunity for Iran and Russia is less fuel use and replacement,” he said, noting that Russia has only one trick in the bag because its economy depends on fossil fuels.
These announcements are coming at a time when the administration of Trump has set out on a mission to support the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, and to replace Russia, which is much cheaper for European consumers.
To this end, the Trump administration’s repatriates of U.S. President Donald Trump himself are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project, which, according to Trump, would make Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, worth 11 billion dollars, which is supposed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s zeal for the project is driven by purely economic reasons and is an example of unfair economic strife.
"I am convinced that we have the same opinion that energy cannot be an instrument for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The US position brought resistance to Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
A leading German organization, the Association of German Prime Ministers (BDI), urged the US not to interfere in the energy policy of the EU and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third country interfering with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, director of the Association of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren to 'seriously consider' presidential bid in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "seriously consider" a presidential candidacy after a benign election.
During a meeting at the Holyoke Town Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running for office.
“It is time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and this also requires a woman at the top of her fast,” she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider the presidential candidacy."
At the expense of President Donald Trump, Warren slowly sat down in the city hall, saying that she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.
"To the bone, I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren openly voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, she tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
But the council on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren’s own voters do not think she should run for office in 2020.
According to a report by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Political Exploration Center, 50 percent of “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator would not run.
Thirty-two percent would support her candidacy.
Prieskum showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his potential candidacy and 48 against.
Other names among the Democrats referred to in line with a potential bid in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin Speaks at Donald Trump's PTSD Talk with Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, was drafted into the military on September 11, 2007, and spent a year in Iraq.
On Monday evening he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"As my own son has been going on since he came back, I can relate to the rest of the families who are suffering the consequences of PTSD and the wounds that our soldiers are returning with," she told audiences at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
But when Palin called his arrest an elephant in the room, she said of her son, and of other veterans of the war, that some of them were returning home, more violent, and coming back to ask if they had any respect for what their fellow soldiers and airmen and all the rest of the army had given to this country.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against his wife, interfering in the administration of domestic violence and holding weapons in a state under the influence of narcotics, Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department, was brought in.
18 states and D.C. back opposition to new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and D.C. filed an amicus curiae in Washington on Friday in support of asylum-seekers’ objections to the new policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the appellant in the Grace v. Sessions action brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been made public.
She said her partner "and his sons, members of a violent gang," had abused her, but the U.S. Department of State denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The representatives of the states that support Grace wrote about El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, among whom there are many asylum seekers from the United States, as nations facing serious problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores entire decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all requests for asylum be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the request, and such a determination violates this prince's decision," the filing of the amicus curiae states.
Representatives went on to argue that policies that prevent immigrants from entering the U.S. hurt the U.S. economy because they were likely to become entrepreneurs and “supply the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims escaping domestic abuse and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a statement.
Never should the asylum have been given to solve all the problems — not even all the serious problems — that people face every day in the whole world.
The number of sacrifices at Palo doubled, and the desperate effort to save those who survived was overtaken.
For those who were saved, the situation kept getting worse.
"It's very tense," says Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she struggles to wobble her restless little boy in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance holds the body together.
“Clean water is scarce.”
And the people began to return to their desolate houses, and to go through their flooded things, and to save all that was found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, cracked in rattlesnake.
Some of the wounded, including two Haris who had suffered from fractures of the spine and shoulder, were resting outside the Army Hospital in Pal, where they were being treated outside for severe aftershocks.
And his eyes were filled with tears, when he remembered the sensation of the earthquake, which shook the fifth floor of his hotel room, in which he was with his wife and daughter.
"It's not the time to save.
I think the falling ruins have pressed me against the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what has happened to her or to my child.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Mobbing” Through “Propaganda Reclames”
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement in the US newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador accused China of using American pressure to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to a paid China Daily ad in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s top-selling newspaper — after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional election.
According to U.S. officials, Trump’s accusations of Beijing trying to meddle in the U.S. election are a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is imminent for foreign governments to certify advertisements in support of trade, Beijing and Washington have at the same time engaged in a escalating trade war, under which both sides are adjusting tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade conflict were meant to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which back Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of foreign goods to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
As Branstad wrote in his contribution to the issue of the Des Moines Register, “China has now doubled its bullying by making public its propaganda ads in our free press.”
“By spreading its propaganda, China is exploiting the American venerated tradition of freedom of expression and free press by making public paid ads in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the contrary, in a newspaper stand on the streets here in Beijing, you will find only limited dissenting voices and you will not get the desired real picture of the diverse views that Chinese citizens can have on the problematic economic trajectory of China, because the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that "some of China's most prominent news outlets have thwarted his suggestion to publish" his article, though he did not say what the newspaper was about.
Analysts warn that because of the debacle with Kavanaugh, Republicans have a chance at women voters
Since many of the leading Republicans support and defend Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, who faces several charges of sexual assault, analysts warn that they will be avenged in the coming courtrooms, especially from women.
And the emoticons which followed this matter were exceedingly strong, and the majority of the republicans had already announced that they would go to the polls.
"These things cannot be returned," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, in an article for The Hill published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that a last-minute request for an FBI investigation by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would suffice to appease angry voters.
Women will never forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow, or November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a consultant and national speaker of the progressive MoveOn group, in a Washington newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, demonstrators chanted in the corridors of the Senate, “New news is coming!” when the Republicans in the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation cross all boundaries,” said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
“People say that motivation is already high; and that’s true.
But it could be even higher, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who do not like the president, but often do not.
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he gave details of his sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a sharp reaction if the Republicans confirmed their support.
"This has become a great mess for the GOP," Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Commission, told NBC News early last week.
“It’s not just the vote of the commission or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the bench, it’s also how the Republicans have stood up to it and how they have behaved,” Guy Cecil, a U.S. prioritization leader, said in a statement.
But it seems that the Americans are at variance as to whom to believe in the dawning of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, favoring rather Ford.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents were certain or likely to believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they were certain or likely to believe Kavanaugh.
Moreover, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was likely, or at least for the time of his testimony, to have lied, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After being pushed by Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted her intoxicated when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed her genitals when they attended a bachelor party at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to overcome Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, called Inrupt, is a community based on Berners-Lee’s open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide whether their data is stored and who is allowed access to individual information.
In an exclusive interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind the Inrupt project was “the rule of the world.”
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
Applications using Solid technology allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It may include contact lists, job lists, calendar, bookcase, and other personal and work tools.
It’s something like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all of which are available on a single browser.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that the user decides who will have access to each type of information.
Society calls it “the strengthening of personal authority by means of giving.”
According to John Bruce, the general steward of Inrupt, the purpose of the community is to bring forth the resources, the process, and the dexterity, by which the Solid may be made available to all.
The community currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several internal developers hired to work on the project, and a community of voluntary coders.
Since that week, technology developers around the world have been able to start creating their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and he are not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether they will make a complete change that will completely overturn all their business models overnight or not."
"We're not asking for permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on the Medium portal published on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new website built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last months, Berners-Lee has been a vocal influence in the discussions about the net neutrality.
At the time of Inrupt’s launch, Berners-Lee was the founder and editor of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I see the next era of the web very optimistically,” Berners-Lee added.
The priest Bernard Vann: the celebrations of the bearer of the Cross of Vict<0xC3><0xB3>ria during the First World War
They celebrated the one and only Anglican priest, who had been given the cross of Victoria as a soldier during the First World War, in his hometown for the 100th anniversary.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann received the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But after four days the sniper killed him, and he never learned of the highest honor of the british army.
At a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial plaque on the Sabbath.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "amazingly symbolic" that the dock was unveiled exactly 100 years after his old father's esteemed heroic battle.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very dense swarm and with a strong firing of field weapons and machine guns."
After this, he hurried through the line of fire and led the soldiers forward with "excellence," destroying three of the weapons of the field.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 – just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his old father "are something that I will never approach in my life, but it gives me a feeling of deep humility."
And they laid a crown with their brother Dr. James Vanna, who was the leader of the band of the wicked Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said, “He was very honored to have been a part of the team. ” He added,“ The bravery of a true hero shows great support for him. ”
The MMA fans were waiting until Bellator 206 closed in the night, and instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine staying up all night watching the thrilling Bellator 206 finals and not seeing the end of the main show.
San Jose's schedule contained 13 matches backed by the top six, and in the UK he was sent out live all night long by Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to confront each other, viewers in the UK were shocked when Peppa the Pig appeared on screen instead of streaming.
Some of them were very disappointed because they were waiting for this fight to happen in the morning.
A fan on Twitter described the children’s storyline as “a sick joke.”
"This is the ruling that this content was inappropriate from 6:00 a.m., so they had to switch it to a children's program," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about the transfer.
"Yes, it was 'Peppa Pig'."
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they would work to ensure that UK viewers could watch their broadcasts in the future.
"When I think about repetitions, I think we'll be able to sort it out somehow," Coker said.
“However, it is the sixth hour of the day, so that we will not be able to resolve it before the sixth hour, that is, the Monday of the day.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, then, that when these things happened, we exchanged many ways and were not friends.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But no, it was the ordinances of the law.
I promise you that in the future this will never happen again.
Let’s cut it down to five games instead of six, as we have to do quickly. We tried to give a little more to the fans, and then we pulled the strings.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "minor" for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he felt less valued for his sexuality when he was growing up - but that's what motivated him to be successful.
The 24-year-old athlete said that, except in high school, he realized that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking on the first show of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, moderated by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about gay rights to give others “hope.”
In the same way, he said, “When he became a parent, he began to care a little less about winning the Olympics.
The regular moderator of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off because of her illness.
In the first program with Laverne Daley, he said, “I feel like everyone else when I sing, because it is not lawful for a man to please both boys and girls. ”
In his own words, “To this day I have felt inferior and inferior, and this has given me strength and motivation to succeed. ”
He wanted to prove that he was something, so he said, “Don’t let anyone fool you when they find out about his sexuality. ”
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a leading LGBT rights champion and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more landscapes to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said, “This is why he spoke, because he was fortunate enough to be able to live openly without evidence. He wanted to give this hope to others. ”
The three-time master of the world said that when he fell in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "he was surprised."
Last year, Daley became friends with his Oscar-winning host, who is 20 years his senior, but says they never had a problem with the age difference.
“When you live to see these things in your youth ” (he was 14 years old at his first Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later),“ it will be hard to find a man in his age who will have the same successes and misfortunes. ”
A couple had a baby by the time they were married. They had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said, “The way he looks at the world has changed. ”
“If you asked me a year ago, ” he said,“ I would like to know how much I need to win a gold medal. ”
You know that there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with a brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the thought of dying, and one of the last things he was asked was whether they had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — because he wanted to be on the first council.
"I could not say to him, 'Father, you will no longer be here,' so that you can sit in the first council," he said.
“I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and when he stopped breathing and he was dead, I was finally able to say that he is not immortal, ” he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that I had been dreaming about it my whole life – jumping in front of a home audience at the Olympics, there’s no better feeling,” he said.
And the sound of his song, Stream of Heather Small, which made an impression on him in preparation for the Olympics, insinuated him, and is still causing him to simmer.
Desert Island Discs aired on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson in weak form set for Saturday's Ryder Cup matches
Phil Mickelson will reach the record when he plays his 47th game at the Ryder Cup, but he will have to show himself in a better form, so that he will not be an unhappy goalkeeper.
Mickelson, who has played on the doubles for a record 12 times, was ousted by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourball and foursome matches.
Instead of being at the centre of the Diane, as it had been many times before for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day encouraging and improving his game in the hope of correcting his reputation.
The 48-year-old player did not shoot even at the height of his career, which is not ideal for the narrow Le Golf National, where in the long field usually erroneous shots are revenged.
And as if the challenge itself were not sufficient, Mickelson is facing the ninth fight in the field, against Francesco Molinari, the exact champion of the British Open, who, along with Tommy Fleetwood, the rookie, was able to win all the matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind before the start of 12 individual matches, get a good start, the performance of Mickelson could be absolutely key.
And Furycus spoke boldly to his husband, and it was hard for him to say anything else.
» He knew exactly what he was doing today. He hit me on the back and grabbed me by the shoulder. He said he would be ready for tomorrow. «
"He is very self-confident.
He is a member of the See of Glory in the past, and this week has been marked by us.
I couldn't imagine him playing two games.
I had a better idea, but this was the way it was described, and we felt that this was the way we should do it.
He wants to be outside on the grass, just like everyone else. ”
On Sunday, Mickelson broke Nick Fald's record for the highest number of games played at the Ryder Cup.
It could be the closure of his career at the Ryder Cup, which has never reached the heights of his individual balance sheet.
Mickelson has won 18 victories, 20 overs, and 7 draws, though Furyk says that his presence has brought about the same incalculable value.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make jokes about people, and he's a great companion," he explained.
"I think the younger players had a lot of fun with him, and it was great to see that.
His contribution is not only in his play."
"Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that strong conduct can soon be lost.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows by his own experience that a great deal of leadership in the final day of the Ryder Cup can easily be changed into an inconvenient ride.
The Danish golfer made his debut at the 1997 game in Valderram, where he had a five-point advantage over the Americans under captain Seve Ballesteros, but he got through the goal line with the narrowest possible victory of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I constantly have to remember how strong we were at Valderram, how strong we were at Brookline, where we lost, and how we won at Valderram, but that’s how it is,” Bjorn said in the photo, after winning 5-3 on Friday and leading Le Golf National yesterday with a score of 10.
So the story shows me and everyone else that the game is not over.
We'll go full throttle tomorrow.
We will stand on the grass and do everything as we should. ”
Until the points are on the table, the struggle is not over.
Now we have our goal, which is to win this trophy, for which we must meet together.
“As I say from the beginning, I’m targeting 12 players on our side, but I’m also aware that we’re facing the other side, the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about what happened to his players on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never have gone ahead of the game.
Tomorrow we have another fight.
Tomorrow will be about individual performances, and that is something completely different.
It is good for you to have sex with your partner when you are successful. But standing there for yourself will test your golf skills to the full.
This is the message that players must remember, that tomorrow they will get the very best out of themselves.
Now leave your partner alone, and he must go and get the very best out of himself. ”
Unlike Bjorn, fellow player Jim Furyk will want his players to play better than individuals, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furycus himself was at both ends of the great tournaments at the last day, when he was at the concurrence of the winning team in Brooklyn, before he was defeated, when the “Miracle in Medina ” came to Europe.
"I remember every damn word," he said, answering the question of how Captain Ben Crenshaw encouraged his players to the final day in 1999.
“Tomorrow we have twelve major games, but you would like to begin quickly, as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When that momentum goes in one direction, the struggles in the middle are very important.
And having formed our tent, we placed the children in a manner in which we felt that we were going to make a plot tomorrow.
Thomas was given the task of trying to fight and faced Rory McIlroy in the highest fight, with the rest of Europe, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the upper half.
"I went with this group of boys in this council, because I thought we would go all this way," Bjorn said of the choice of his individuals.
Germany's new warship was once again delayed.
According to local media reports, the newest frigate of the German Navy was to be brought into service in 2014 as a replacement for the old warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until next year because of faulty systems and the accumulation of cargoes.
The introduction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the completely new triad of the Baden-Württemberg frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019 according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by the Army Spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project suffered after being delivered with worrying problems.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg triad, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the old frigates of the Bremen triad.
It is well known that they will contain executive work, anti-aircraft and anti-submarine missile councils, as well as certain technologies of concealment, such as reduced radar reflectivity, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important functions include a longer maintenance period - it would be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home ports.
But if there be a continual deterioration of the ships of war, which have made it possible for the Germans to exercise power over the sea, by the time they are brought into trouble, they will become obsolete, according to the newspaper Die Zeit.
Last year, the unfortunate frigate F125 was caught in the news when the German Navy officially refused to bring the vessel into a shipwreck and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had given the ship back to the builder after it had been delivered.
Not much was known about the reason for their return, but the German media reported some very important things that caused the ship to become unusable when it was put on a mission.
The disadvantages of the software were especially important, because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg triad would be overtaken by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the manpower of the older frigates of the Bremen triad.
It was also found that the ship was significantly overweight, which reduced its performance and limited the ability of the navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar triads of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - the return of crew training - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion) - compared to the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
But the problems of the new frigates are especially important, because of the recent warnings that the German naval power is shrinking.
At the beginning of this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliamentary Defense Committee, confirmed that the navy actually "has no ships capable of deploying".
And the magistrate said, The matter was settled in time, because the old ships had been delivered out of shipwreck, but they did not supply a replacement vessel.
He lamented that the desire for the frigate triad of Baden-Württemberg was unable to make money in the navy.
Organiz<0xC3><0xA1>cia National Trust reveals the secret life of netopierov
But a new expanse, which runs on the dominion of the high places of Scotland, is to reveal how the bats exploit the land in the hunt for food.
We hope that these will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying eccentrics and help guide future activities for the protection of nature.
A study by the National Trust for Scotland will follow a whistling bat and a whistling bat, as well as a luminous and watery bat in the gardens of Inverewe in Wester Ross.
Special loggers are placed in key locations in the vicinity of immobility to monitor the activities of bats throughout the season.
Employees of this organization and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys with the help of hand-held detectors.
An expert sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of call of the bats and the activity of each species.
Then a map of their natural environment and administration will be made, so that a detailed picture of their way of life will be created in every way.
Rob Dewar, NTS nature conservation adviser, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of the natural environment are the most important for bats and how they are used by species.
This information will help you to determine the benefits of the work of living, such as the formation of meadows, and how best to keep the forests from bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the last ten years.
They are threatened by the works of building and of development, which have an effect on the growth of grass and the loss of their living space.
Wind turbines and lighting can be dangerous. They can also be used for gliding and some chemical treatment of building materials. They can also be used by domestic cats.
But the bats are not blind in reality.
But because of their night hunting habits, their ears are like eyes, for the hunt is profitable.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to pinpoint insects and obstructions in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land all over the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts who have been trained. They regularly conduct examinations, inspections of assemblies, and sometimes rescues.
And having established the first and only reserved protected place for bats in the estate of Three in Dumfries and Galloway, which is the home of eight of the ten species of bats in Scotland.
David Thompson, the steward of immobilities, says that the dominion is the ideal terrier for them.
"We've got an amazing preestor for the bats here in Threeave," he said.
“We have old buildings, many protected trees, and all the good habitats.
But there are still many things we do not know about bats, so that the work we do here and in other vital matters will help us to understand better those who need food. ”
He points out that it is important to check the bat before maintenance is carried out in an immobile manner, because it is possible that the unwitting destruction of one maternal assembly could kill up to 400 females and young, which would likely destroy the entire local population.
Fleas are kept safe, and it is against the law to kill, or to abuse, or to destroy, or to gather them together.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish clerk for the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to get involved in the relief effort.
She said, “We still have much to learn about our bats, and about many of our companions, we simply don’t know how their populations feed. ”
Ronaldo Rejects Allegations of Rape, But Lawyers Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo calls the accusations of rape “false administrations,” saying that people want to be “seen” by his name.
His lawyers are suing the German magazine Der Spiegel, which made these accusations public.
The Portuguese and Juventus attacker was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram, calling the indictment a “fake administration.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is a false charge," said the five-time winner of the camera's Ballon d'Or.
They want to be seen through my name.
It's normal.
They want to be honored by saying my name, but this is the work I do.
"I'm a happy man, and everything's fine," the player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the magazine Der Spiegel over the accusations, which they called “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy”.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount of the corresponding seriousness of the offense, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada, they allegedly went back to the player's room after meeting Ronaldo and Mayorga at the nightclub, where he allegedly raped her anal.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was a “99% good guy” who lied about “one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was voluntary.
Mayorga also claims that she took photographs of her wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she felt "fearful of retribution" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now trying to renegotiate the deal because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United and this year moved to the Italian giant Juventus with a deal worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would regret forever’ loss of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom “would be forever sorry” if it lost its status as the world leader in automotive manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark.
He said it was “disturbing” that the Toyota UK community had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at a factory in Burnastone, not far from Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker has said that if there were a no-deal Brexit at the border, it could cut jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive in Burnastone.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work if they leave the EU without a deal.
BMW, for example, says it will close its small race in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern is what car manufacturers call a risk to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is just-in-time, with handicrafts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for custom-made cars.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29th, the playing field could be disrupted, leading to inconvenience and lack of work.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a daily supply at its Derbyshire plant, to bring about a community, and thus stop production.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely calibrated to avoid this border control.”
"We need to have a deal, we want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to talk about the same kind of business, but to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 Today.
The proof of this, not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue the very successful struggle of the supply chain.
Toyota could not say for how long production would stop, but warned from a long-term perspective that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately increase the cost of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnastone for 24 years and is a member of the Trade Union in the race, said that his members were becoming more and more concerned: “In my experience, when these places of work disappear, they will never return.
The official in charge said, “We have put forward a plan for the future relationship with the EU that is sure and reliable. ”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “deferred to another week” as candidate Brett Kavanaugh’s fight for the highest court continues, White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein is looking at the work of Robert Mueller, a special legal representative, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the ties between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and the potential futility of the president’s investigation.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, putting Mueller’s independence at risk, Washington has been gossiping for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of eavesdropping to record conversations with Trump and recall the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed this administration.
On the last day of the week he went to the White House, where news was made that he was about to withdraw.
Instead, on Thursday, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would not "prefer" to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was weakened to prevent a run-in with the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was witnessed by both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which resulted in a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
And when they had asked her about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said, “The time has not been set for this, but it may be this week. I understand that there will be a shift to another week, for all the rest of the matters that take place with the highest judgment.
We’ll see and we’ll always advise the press.”
Some reporters have supported this claim: Sanders has not held a brief press conference at the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked him why.
Sanders said that the lack of short-circuiting was not caused by opposition to the television reporters, who wanted to be dazzled, although she said, “I do not agree with the reality that they want to be dazzled. ”
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press should be increased.
"The president is making more decisions based on the concept of questions, and he will answer them than any other president before him," she added, without giving any evidence, "Let's look at these figures."
Short press conferences will continue to flow, Sanders said, but “if there is a chance to ask a question directly to the President of the United States of America, it is incomparably better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often, and in the last few weeks you have seen us very often, and there will be a brief press conference when you can speak with the President of the United States. ”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Separate press conferences are rare.
The president may have been demonstrating in New York this week, having appeared freely, and on several occasions in strange ways, to the assembled press.
Health secretary writes to EC staff at the National Health Service in Scotland over fears of Brexit
The health secretary wrote to the EC employees working in the National Health Service in Scotland to express the gratitude of the country and the desire to stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the United Kingdom left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to pay the costs of applications for permanent residence of EC citizens working in the framework of their transferred public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: “During the course of the year, discussions continued between the United Kingdom and the Eu and the Eu about the departure, leading to the plans for the autumn.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also set out its preparations for a possible scenario without a deal.
I know that these things must be very troubling for all of you in the same way.
So now I want to say again how much I appreciate the contribution of every worker, without regard for the kind of person he is.
These fellows from all over the EU bring valuable experiences and skills, strengthening and improving the work of health-care services, and bringing benefits to patients and to the communities we serve.
This is your home, and we want you to stay here. ”
Christion Abercrombie to undergo surgeries after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after a head injury in Saturday's 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tennessee-based Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee head coach State Reed told reporters that he had been injured shortly before midday.
"He came to the side of the lake and fell," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidecar before they put him on a stretcher and took him to another examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie is in Vanderbilt after surgery.
Harris added that "no details of the type/scope of the injury" are yet available, and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year university student, is in his first season with the Tennessee State team after a transfer from Illinois.
On the Saturday before leaving the game, he had five total shots, which brought him a total of 18 shots this season.
There will be a higher tax charged to foreign buyers when they buy brazenness in the United Kingdom.
There will be a higher tax charged to those who buy from abroad, when they buy unmovable things in the United Kingdom, so that they can obtain additional money to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the conservatives.
This move neutralizes the success of Corbyn’s effort to attract young voters
The tax that is raised will be collected from those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
The Treasury expects to raise up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that there will be a higher tax charged to those who buy goods from abroad when they buy property in the United Kingdom. The extra money will be used to help the homeless.
This will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises of a more affordable place of residence and to those on high income.
If the tax is raised, it will be collected from individuals and from non-tax-paying companies in the United Kingdom. Additional funds will support the government in its fight against sleeping in the streets.
Now the rate of return, which is due on the two-year old tax, to the second house, and the rate of return on the rent after the purchase, shall be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this step will bring financial resources of up to 120 million pounds a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of those who were newly built in London are bought by those who do not live in the United Kingdom. This increases the prices and makes it difficult for those who buy for the first time to enter the house.
For many rich parts of the country, especially in the chief city, have become cities of spirits to a great number of foreign merchants who spend most of their time outside the country.
But the new policy comes a few weeks after Boris Johnson has called for the humiliation of the treasury, in order that he might more abundantly help the young men to possess their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of fighting against the ground and not taking advantage of the land, and urged May to abandon the quotas for affordable housing, so that Britain's "shame of living" might be put right.
Corbyn announced a tangled series of proposed reforms in the area of residential returnee control of the tenant and termination of the withdrawal "without guilt".
At the same time, he wants to give the committees greater authority to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my office to renewing the British dream, that life should be better for every new generation.
This means consolidating our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build up their lives.
But we cannot allow those who are not in the United Kingdom to buy houses in the same way as those who work hard in Britain. We cannot allow them to buy houses in the same way as those who work hard in the UK.
For the dream of owning houses has become too far away for many people, and the unworthiness of sleeping in the streets remains too real. ”
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to run Scotland”
The head of the Sunderland team, Jack Ross, says that his "final ambition" is to become a manager of Scotland in a certain squad.
The 42-year-old <0xC5><0xA0>kot enjoys the challenge of revitalizing the northeastern club, which is currently in third place in the league one, three points from the first place.
This year, he moved to Stadium of Light after joining the Scottish Premier League with St Mirren last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a baseball cap and it was that," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
“But as a child, I grew up with my father in Hampden, watching Scotus, and this has always drawn me back.
But this opportunity will come only if I succeed in managing the club. ”
Among Ross' predecessors, as the manager of the Sunderland patria, Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former team boss Alloa Athletic says he doesn’t want to be afraid of following such acclaimed names in such a big club because he has previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success will be measured by whether or not I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
“Because of the staffing and equipment, this club is undoubtedly in the Premier League,” he said.
"It is not an easy task to get there," he said, "but I would consider myself successful if I could get a club there."
Ross has only been in office for three years, after serving as assistant chief at Dumbartone and a 15-month midterm as a coach at Hearts.
Alloa then helped him recover from a relegation to the third league, changing St Mirren from a relegation to a championship title in the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It's probably a real crossroads," he said as he stepped into the Aloe.
“I truly believed that managing a business is more appropriate to me than it feeds me.
This sounds strange, because a good deed has been done to me, and I have secured a good standard of living, having enjoyed some maximum of understanding.
But the food you eat can be very hard.
There are many things you must go through on a weekly basis.
I still do it when it comes to stress and pressure at work, but in management I feel good.
I always wanted to do this, but now I am doing it. I am convinced that I am in a better place than I have ever been in the whole time I was growing up. ”

The analysis shows that the perfect time for a beer cup is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heatwaves have increased sales in british pubs struggling for survival, but have increased pressure on rescue chains.
The data revealed that the hamster and bar sector had seen a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but sales in the restaurateurs had decreased by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, CGA’s sales consultant, who left the data, said: “The longer-than-expected participation of the Englishwoman in the World Cup, the longer-than-expected participation of the Englishwoman, meant that the yul followed a similar trend as the previous month, except that when the sales of the convulsions increased by 2.8 %, with a decrease of
The decrease of 1.8% in the maintenance services in Yuna was only worsened in July.
And to the innkeepers, who had a drink, and to the bar, fare better than to the innkeepers, who, having regard to the same things, were diminished.
Let us eat in the same way, though not as dramatic as the restaurateurs.
For it seems that they were going to have a drink only.
In the context of spasms and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6% for this month, with food falling by three percent.
RSM leisure and hospitality analyst Paul Newman said: “These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
But the time and influence of great social or sporting conceits are the chief factors in the selling in the home market.
It is not surprising that the restorative groups continue to struggle, although the average decline of 4.8 percent in the market will be particularly painful in view of the ongoing cost pressures.
For a long hot year it was not possible for those who were trying to break the law to have something to eat to make them feel worse, and the time will show if the milder temperatures that we had in August will give us the freedom we need. ”
The total growth of the market in taverns and restaurants returned to new open beds was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the introduction of badges.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors the UK’s spasm, bar and restauration retaliation and collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion British pounds and is an established industry standard.

Authorities have raised concerns about the disclosure of sexual content.
And the twenty-percent of the women who worked there showed that they were taking care of the important things they could do. They showed their parents what they could do with their own money.
A mother who ran into the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl urging others to rape her.
A survey carried out by the UK’s Digital Leadership Organizations and the Conference of Readers and Independent School Managers (HMC) found that 40% of the population aged 11 to 18 has two profiles, with half of them admitting to having private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, “It’s disturbing that so many teenage boys are tempted to create places online where their parents and teachers can’t find them. ”
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee at the annual general meeting of the governing body as an underperforming riadist.
Doyle is the most successful athlete in Scotland, and the president, Ian Beattie, has described this as an opportunity for those who practice sports to take advantage of the international experience of the last decade.
“Eilidh has great respect among the Scottish, British, and world athletics communities, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit by leading her to a good council, ” said Beattie.
Doyle said, “I want to be a voice for the athletes, and I hope to be able to contribute effectively and to lead the sport in Scotland. ”
The American, who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta and together has four Olympic gold medals and is a regular BBC commentator, has suffered a transient ischemic attack and is now unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a coroner.
I couldn't walk.
And the physicians said, “The time will tell if I will recover, and to what extent. ”
It is exhausting work, but I have been fully healed. I have learned to walk anew, and I am practicing agility today.
Thank you for encouraging the administration!”
An ad for a breast milk pump comparing mothers with cows divides opinions in the online world
The company for the production of sucklers for mother's milk has divided the opinions in the online world with advertising that compares the mother's milking with the milking.
To mark the release of this “the quietest breast pump in the world”, the consumer technology community, Elvie, has published an advertisement instigated by a dark-skinned music video to show the freedom that the new breast pump gives to mothers.
The four real mothers dance in a hay barn filled with cows for a song, which says, “Yes, I suck milk, but you don’t see the covetous tail. ” And,“ In case you haven’t noticed, it’s my breasts. ”
The chorus continues: “I pump, I pump, I suck so much, I pump, I pump, I suck my beauties.”
However, the advertisement, which was published on the Facebook page of the company, opened up controversy in the online world.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of commentators, the video aroused mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it despises the “threats” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just as we need to conceive and give birth so that we can produce milk, except that we will steal their children from me until some days after they have given birth. ”
The Elvie breast milk extractor is unobtrusively stored in a baby bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another user commented: “It is understandably traumatic for the mother and the young.
But yes, why not use them to spread the message about breast milk to mothers who keep their children? ”
Someone else added, “Advertising is detached from reality.”
Others advocated advertising, with one woman admitting that the song appeared to be “gifted.”
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I would buy a suction cup if I were still breastfeeding.
When I was sowing milk, I felt like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I take it the way it is.
It's a brilliant product," one woman wrote.
Another user commented: “Funny advertising aimed at moms who suck milk (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.”
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges dairy products.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveal that they all danced with discreet breast milk suckers tucked in bras.
The meaning of the campaign is this: Many women who suck milk say that they feel like cows.
But the breast-suction cup of Elvia is quiet. It doesn’t want braces or a tube. It is a breast-feeding bra. It gives women freedom to keep their children, to suckle, and to spend time outdoors.
Ana Balarinov<0xC3><0xA1>, a partner and mother in the Early Childhood Development programme, commented: “Elvie’s breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between the female and the female nurses, we wanted to put the suction of the mother’s milk and all its appeals in the spotlight, but in a fun and telling way to demonstrate the unbelievable sense of freedom that the new suction cup will bring.
This is not the first time that Elvie the suction cup has appeared in the headlines.
During Fashion Week in London, a mother of two published a book about the designer Marta Jakubowska, using this product.
Hundreds of strangers moved peacefully to a tent camp on the border of Texas.
The number of detained visiting children has increased, although the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and practices introduced by the Trump administration have been effectively repressed by children thanks to their supporters.
The illegal aliens themselves constituted the majority of the supporters, fearing that their own ability to remain in the land would be in jeopardy by coming forward with a child.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of their households would have to submit fingerprints and that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officer Matthew Albence told Congress that the Bureau had arrested dozens of people who had asked for the support of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the authorities confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal record.
Some 80 percent of those who are either supporters or members of the household of supporters are illegal in the country, and a large number of them are foreign nationals with criminal records.
So we continue to monitor these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
Now the magistrates, who are trying to work out matters concerning children more quickly, have put forward new rules, which will require that some of them be brought to trial within one month of their detention, and not after 60 days, according to the previous standard, by the workers in the shelter.
Many will present themselves through a video conference call, not in person, so that they may present their case to the judge, according to the legal standing of the case, on account of the presence of the court.
Those who are classified as not entitled to help will be quickly deported.
The longer the children are detained, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape, because the workers of the shelter and administration that were made known in the system in the last months have been misled.
The lawyers found that these fears were greater than those of Tornillo, where the signs of the child's suffering were overlooked because of the greatness of the order.
They added, “The transfer of children to a sheltered place, without giving them time to prepare themselves emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, could cause the kind of trauma that many people are struggling with.
Syria will tell US, French and Turkish “occupational forces” to stand down immediately
Walid al-Moualem, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who addressed the UN General Assembly, also called on the Syrian refugees to return home, though the war in the country had been raging for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syria were illegal under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that “we will treat them accordingly.”
He said to the crowd, “Soon you will be able to do anything without any reason. ”
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over in Syria.” Since 2011, more than 360,000 people have died, with millions expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “fighting in this holy battle until it has cleansed all the Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “the illegal presence of foreigners.”
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and radioing Kurdish forces and even Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops destroyed in the war.
Regarding the question of refugees, Moualem said that the charges were appropriate for their return, and accused "some Western countries" of "the spread of irrational fear" that led refugees to stay away from home.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns," he said.
“They are politicizing what is supposed to be purely humanitarian problems. ”
The United States and the European Union have warned that reconstruction aid will not be sought for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in the last great insurgent fortress Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has deterred a sprawling attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, home to three million people.
Moualem, however, said the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that military action would be aimed at returning jihadist fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front, which "will be removed."
Staffan de Mistura, the envoy of the United Nations, hopes to convene a new committee of governors and opposition leaders to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and to prepare the way for what will happen.
Moualem set the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the group’s work should be limited to “revising the articles of the present constitution” and warning against intervention.
Why Trump will get a second functional analogy
With this logic, Mr. Trump would win a re-election in 2020, even though a slew of liberal spectators are likely to hope that his presidential office will end the indictment and scandal prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidential office at all”!
But there is no sign of weariness of the audience.
Since 2014, the average time spent on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and on MSNBC it has almost doubled to 1.6 million.
Fox News TV has 2.4 million viewers in its prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, Nielsen said, and MSNBC’s “Show with Rachel Maddow” has a top rating with up to 3.5 million viewers in the mainstream media.
"This is a perplexing plotter, because it is not something we understand," said Neal Baer, creator of the ABC drama The President in Counsel, about the mystery of a government that will become president after the attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedian and relater to "Just the Funny Parts: And Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a new theory.
Before the 2016 election, she remembers driving a taxi in Boston.
The guide told her that she would vote for Trump.
“Why? ” she asked.
He said, "because he's funny," Scovel told me.
In this chaos there is a fun value.
For apart from everything else on television, the stories from Washington are able to determine the future dispute between Roe and Wade, whether the families of the visitors will be able to be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignorance is a luxury that only privileged spectators can afford.
But it is beyond the reach of an informed citizen when you see that six hours later you are watching the conversation of a group of experts about the "deeper background" as the source of the book "Fear" by Bob Woodward, the bomber leather jacket of Paul Manafort from an ostrich worth 15,000 dollars ("a gross piece of clothing with arrogance").
For I will never again look at Super-Maria in the same way.

When I came to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a mere twenty-six degrees [26 degrees] outside on the north bank of Kaua, but he was inwardly watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
But he could not keep away from this, except with Brett Kavanaugh, who was before the Sanhedrin, and the future of the High Court was uncertain.
“I remember all these foolish things we had done in the past, when people said, ‘ This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization, ’ ” said Mr. Fleiss to me.
“I thought this was a joke, but it turned out that they were right. ”

The money of the bell flows into the election for a drawing in the half of the functional period
Not surprisingly, the 17th district of Pennsylvania is experiencing a flood of money, thanks to the division of the congressional districts, which resulted in the fight for one draw by two fugitives.
This recently redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh stands in opposition to Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who won his drawing in another district in the spring special election.
Lamb is running against another clerk, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who at the same time represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which strongly overlaps with the new 17th district.
They made up the maps after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated for the benefit of the Republicans.
The fight in the new 17th district touched on the financing of the campaign between the main party financial weapons, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
Lamb became famous in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the widely watched March Special Elections to the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
He held the place for more than ten years and President Donald Trump won the term by 20 points.
Political commentators gave the Democrats a slight lead.
U.S. Considers El Salvador Penalization Instead of Supporting China, Then Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight deviation from Washington.
Trump attended a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varel in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners brought out Trump’s organization.
Foreign ministry officials have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over “recent decisions that no longer recognize Taiwan,” ministry spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were taken into account only against El Salvador, which in 2017 received help in the estimated amount of 140 million U.S. dollars returned to drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be painful for the country of Central America and its high level of free will and strife.
As internal meetings continued, the representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity to build on a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the leading administrative officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any sanctioning of El Salvador.
Now the Vice-President Mike Pence is busy with the conference scheduled for mid-October, and the diplomats have been led in as a sign of the importance of the meeting which is being held by the administration.
Then the ambassadors of the United States of America quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, without any new administration or punishment from Washington.
But the speaker of the White House refused to comment on the details of the matter to Mr. Bolton, who had been briefed by three U.S. officials who had been sent back by two diplomats who had agreed to a discussion about internal strife for the sake of anonymity.
Their administration was confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration, who also spoke as a pretext for anonymity.
Study the facts
Another unexpected event could be the administration of special counsel Robert Mueller about a possible impediment to President Trump’s justice, which now has very substantial evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is also reportedly turning his investigations to see if Trump’s campaign was linked to Russia in an attack on our will.
If Congress were to change sides, Mr. Trump would face responsibility in this body just as he is preparing to go back to the electorate and possibly to the jury of his House members.
That’s a lot of presumption, if I’m not to suggest that the fall of Trump is inevitable – or his equivalent in Europe.
Each one of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice in what way he can accomplish the length of the battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, but the West would have to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We did not receive it, and we did not have the opportunity to avoid the year of the slaughter that followed.
Such things are happening all the time, and the course of democracy is hardened or discredited.
Americans are now facing some of these inflection points.
What do we do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since it was announced in the administration that he had proposed secret recordings of the president last year and had speculated about his incapacity to carry out the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times's coverage is inaccurate.
What shall we say, if the new inquiry of Brett Kavanaugh, being requested by him, is not complete or just? or if he is received before the High Court, despite credible accusations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And first of all, shall we vote in the middle of a term of office in the Congress, which will hold Trump accountable?
But if we become sluggish in these things, the democracies will be put to sleep for a long time.
I believe that we are not afraid because of the teaching I received when I was in Prague.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers feel optimistic about his meeting with Rapid Vieden
In this way the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vieden on the fourth day. They know that the victory over the Austrians in the formidable tie in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from introducing himself for the first time in the season, until a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for more.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good point,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to a game and thought we could get something, so we went away with a point.
For perhaps in the end we were able to reach out to each other, but overall the tie was only a fair result.
Perhaps they were better in the first half, and we were better in the second half.
On the fourth day of the week there will be another great night for the people of Europe.
Let us hope that we will score three points, and it will be a difficult game, because they had a good result in their last fight, but I am confident that with the fans behind us we can press on them and get a positive result.
Last year was hard on me because of my injuries and changes in the club itself, but now there is a factor in the game that makes us feel good.
That's good and the boys really enjoy it, we have great training.
Let’s hope that we will now push last season to the brink and be successful.”
Women do not sleep because they are afraid of the things they do when they are drunk.
The people in the meeting had a clear idea of the way they wanted to be taken care of. But very few of them spoke to their family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study reported that they were talking to their partners about the cost of long-term care.
And it was revealed by only ten percent that they had discussed these things with their children.
"People want to be taken care of by a family member, but they don't take steps to talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of life at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your partner and your children. You can’t get your family ready to work if you don’t show them your desires in advance.
Work together with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you can be careful, for this choice can be a factor in determining your expenses.
Bring your financial advisor. Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay these expenses.
For your long-term vigilance may include a long-term covenant of existence, a hybrid covenant of life, to cover your expenses or your self-sufficiency, which you have.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles at a crisis.
Gather a man who can take care of your health, so that you may appoint a trustworthy person who will take care of your health, and will provide for professionals to fulfill your desires in case you are unable to communicate.
Also consider the power of a legal representative for your finances.
But choose a trustworthy one who will make financial decisions for you and will secure the payment of your bills if you fail.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elder parent requires prompt medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?

At least 384 people were killed in the terrible earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. The authorities said that the number of sacrifices was expected to increase.
As a result of the paralyzed communication, or humanitarian officials able to obtain the desired information from the office of the regent in Donggal, an area north of Pal, which is closer to the epicenter of an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 earthquakes.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Pal after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about the cities of Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the middle province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck it.
Donggala is a regency stretching more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region of the patriarchy under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the central province of Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
In the same way, the grain of nickel is important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morbali, on the other side of the seacoast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian disaster agency, the cities of Palu and Donggala have been affected by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggale.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of the city of Donggal, killing nine people.
Indonesia lies seismically in the Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes strike it regularly.
Here are some of the great earthquakes and tsunamis in the last years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 provinces and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake with a magnitude of 6.8 struck the southern part of Java, the most populated island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that struck the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province, there was an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6.
More than 1100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5 struck one of the islands of Mentawai, outside Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed approximately 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the regency of Pidia Jay in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding people of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
At this time there was no tsunami, but more than a hundred people died as a result of the collapse of the buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and caused the temporary confinement of thousands of tourists.

U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspicion of Terrorist Attack in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the United States since 1953.
Saipov, a 30-year-old man, reportedly used a rented expensive Home Depot vehicle on Oct. 31 to carry out an attack on a bike lane along the West Side highway in lower Manhattan by hitting pedestrians and cyclists on the route.
According to the announcement of the commencement of the death sentence in the district of the south of New York, if the public prosecutors wish to obtain the death sentence, they will have to prove that Saip’s “deliberately” killed eight sacrifices and caused a serious injury.
According to the judgment document, the sentence of death will be imposed on both of these charges.
A couple of weeks after the attack, a federal investigation jury filed a 22-point indictment against Saip, which included eight counts of murder with intent to kidnap, which are commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and we will be charged with
The attack required “substantial planning and cold-blooded thinking,” prosecutors said, and described the way Saipov had carried it out as “abominable, cruel, and perverse.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov" caused injury, injury and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadtova, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Herna Diego Mendraza and Alejanza
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since the Southern District of New York last handed down the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
The death penalty was last carried out in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. A married couple were executed after being convicted of swearing and spying on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
They were both put to death by electric rod on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, according to the documents of the court, in the following days and months after the attack, found that there was no reproach of conscience.
And he said to the magistrates that he was well disposed by what he had done, and that she had led the pollens away.
Saip’s accuser said that after watching the videos of ISIS, he used his phone to instruct them to carry out the attack.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be displayed in his hospital room.
At 22, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders of Saipos, said that they were “obviously disappointed” by the decision of the prosecution.
“We think that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of a confession of guilt and a life spent in prison without being released from prison is the only reason for the trauma of these things to everyone involved, ” said Patton.
Saipov's defense had previously urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP Says Nigel Farage Should Be Responsible for Brexit Voting
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a conservative conference, promised today that he would “mobilize the army of men.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians must have “stumbled into an unpleasant situation” from eurosceptics when one of the members of parliament, Theresa May, suggested that he should be in charge of the negotiations with the EU.
In March, Peter Bone, a member of the Conservative Council, said in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would be "already gone" if Mr. Farage were secretary of Brexit.
But the challenge Mrs. May faces in appeasing her deeply divided councils has been rebuked by the conservatives for persevering, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to maintain a compromise plan amid attacks by Brexiteers, anti-poverty supporters and the EU.
The Allies insisted on continuing their efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite resistance – and forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between a package and a “chaos.”
Mr. Bone said at a meeting of the Leave Means Leave group that he wanted to dismiss the prime minister.
He suggested that Mr Farage be involved and accountable for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were in charge, we would be outside," he said.
A member of parliament told Wellingborough: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we need to dismiss the prime minister.”
He said, “We didn’t fight the wars of this world to be submissive.
We want to establish our own laws in our own land.”
Mr Bone noted that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain is completely false.”
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march and told reporters: “I am simply saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
saying, The Prime Minister is unpopular in the public, and will not be voted for by the opposition; but is unpopular with us, and with our activists, who are storming the streets to take us to the first place.
Please leave the Prime Minister like this and begin to listen."
And she added, because of the mighty one, saying, The premieres keep their place, when they keep their vows.
Farage told the assembly that politicians must “feel angry” if they betrayed the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of confidence between us, the people, and our political triad," he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them. ”
He said to the crowd, “I want our political group, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel our anger. ”
saying, “We are mobilizing the people of this land, who have given us the victory over Brexit, and we will never let go until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom. ”
Meanwhile, people were marching through Birmingham for endurance, and afterward they held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A number of activists waved a banner to the Conservatives against Brexit. The group was founded this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis ridiculed the Conservatives for security concerns with the party's application at the start of the conference.
He said, “These are the people who tell us that they can use computer systems and all kinds of technology to get rid of twigs and do business in this country. ”
"It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren Plans to "Rethink" Candidate for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe newspaper reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future after a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that it could defeat Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's stunt in Holyoke was his 36th meeting in the city hall since Trump took office.
The man asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied, “It is time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, and this also requires a woman at the top of her fast.”
Arrested in the shooting of Sims at LSU University
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>cia in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that she had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayden Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11 o'clock in the morning at the press conference ET.
They made a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man who was on the video.
A 20-year-old Sims was shot and died near a Southern University boarding school on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the 247sports network.
Wayde went to help his friend, and Simpson shot him.
And when Simpson was examined, he confessed that he was present, and that he was armed, and that he had confessed to shooting at Wayden Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody in the East Baton Rouge Parish police department.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton nears the world title after his orders brought him victory over Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has been revealed that Mercedes’ orders will play an important role in the races.
Bottas got a good start from the best starting position, and he got Hamilton into an unpleasant situation, defending his position in the first two corners and calling on Vettel to attack his teammate.
But Vettel went into the box first, and let Hamilton go into the coil in the tail of the group, which was to be judged.
Mercedes went to the pit stop next round and followed Vettel, but Hamilton continued after a close run, in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside with the risk of having to defend a third time after a double weight.
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen began with a council meeting and was in seventh place until the end of the first round.
After that, he had a lot of competition. He was on the road. He was ready to finish. He was ahead of Kimi Raikkonen. He finished fourth.
Finally, in the 44th round, he got into the pits, but he could not increase his pace in the remaining eight rounds, so that Raikkonen took the fourth place.
It was a hard day because Valtteri worked fantastically all weekend and was a real gentleman and let me pass by.
He has done a great job, he has a great combination of two strong personalities,” Hamilton said.
It was truly a bad word of the body
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she did not release a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
When the president was speaking at the meeting in West Virginia, he did not directly concern himself with the testimony that Ford gave before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were “hungry, disgusting, and dishonest. ”
He said, “There is one thing that could happen, and this beautiful thing that is happening in the last days of the Senate, when you see the anger of being angry, and being greedy, and being abominable, and being dishonest. ”
And when you look at the public gatherings and the escapes, and they say, “Oh, I did not do this! ”
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you made it public?
Remember her answer... you published the document – “Oh, oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received a letter detailing Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the letter was released in early September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't disclose her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill newspaper.
“She asked me to be trustworthy, ” she said,“ and I have kept the trust that she asked me to be. ”
But the president, who led the people to the meeting on the Sabbath, did not seem to approve of it. He said, “I tell you, this is really a bad thing to say about the body.
Maybe she didn't do it, but she had the worst body language I've ever seen. "
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who was accused by three women of inappropriate sexual conduct, the president indicated that the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to receive authority by all means necessary.
You see the wickedness, the indecency, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to hurt in order to gain power and control,” Mediaite reported on the president’s statement.

More than 800 people have died, and many of them are unfaithful after the great earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering the tsunami.
And severe earthquakes and earthquakes continue to plague the region, and many people are held in chains in the rubble of the city of Pali.
Despite the fact that his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his place in the wildly moving swinging tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was in the airfield at that time, would take off safely.
And he leaped from the porch of the porch of the highway, thinking that it was about to fall.
He died in the hospital.

We were glad to have lost him this morning, when the helicopter arrived at Palo.
"We were very sad when we heard this," he said.
But the experts fear that there will be thousands of sacrifices, because the agency for the reconciliation of the disasters in the land says that the cities of Donggal and Sigi and Boutong are not allowed to enter.
"The number is likely to grow steadily," said Purwo Nugro, the spokesman for the agency, "because many bodies were still in ruins, and we were unable to reach many people."
And the waves, which reached up to six metres, devastated Palos, where a mass burial is being held in the vicinity.
Military and commercial litadles bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance carries a body.
Clean water is rare.
“Small markets are plundered everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the rest, but we don’t know what we’ll find there.
Now this is already a tragedy, but it can be made worse. ”

H<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xA1>ria lietadla in Micronesia: According to Air Niugini, there is an unfaithful man in the lagoon after the accident
Now the airline company, which was traveling on a long flight, saying that one man was unfaithful, after she had first reported that they had safely evacuated all 47 passengers and crew from the sinking ship.
Air Niugini reported that on Saturday afternoon it was discovered that a man was missing.
The air force showed that they were working with the authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find this man.
But the airline did not immediately respond to a request for more detailed information about the traveller, such as his age or affiliation.
The local ships helped save the rest of the passengers and the crew, after the ship collided with the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six people were left in the hospital on the Sabbath, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The air force and the U.S. Navy said that the ship had landed in the lagoon before the start of the runway.
And some of the witnesses thought that the ship had passed the course.
American traveler Bill Jaynes said that the craft flew very low.
"It was a great happiness," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said, “He and others have managed to get through deep water to the needy exits in the boat that goes under water. ”
He said the flight attendants panicked and shouted and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the sailors working nearby to improve the moth were also helping to save the life of the inflatable boat, which had been brought to shore by men before the ship sank into about 30 feet [100 feet] of deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network databases indicate that 111 people have died in the last two decades in the accidents of airlines registered in PNG, but Air Niugini was not involved in the accident.
An analyst sets the timeline of the night, during which a woman was burned alive
The charges ended on Saturday in a reopened indictment against a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of judicial analysis.
He plotted for the jury how he used cell phone records to link the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old obituary Jessica Chambers the night she died.
Rowlett found out that he had obtained location data from some cell phones, which showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening when she died, contrary to what he had said before, reported The Clarion Ledger.
And when the data showed that his cell phone was at the time, which he said was with his friend Michael Sanford, with Chambers, the police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said, “He lied because my car was in Nashville. ”
Another contradiction was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
And the records of the cell phones showed that they knew each other only one week.
Rowlett said that once upon the death of Jessica Chambers, Tellis erased her administrations, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped them out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is planning to present the closing statements in a notch.
And the magistrate said, He expects the judgment to be brought before the jury on that day.

"Another black woman?"
New York City Guardian Sues Couple Over Statement After ‘Rasist’ Texting Administration
A New York City custodian is suing the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving incorrect text messages from her mother, who complained she was "another black woman."
The couple argues that they are racists, equating the lawsuit with “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked to learn that her new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she came to work on the first day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEE, MORE <0xC4><0x8C>ERNO<0xC5><0xA0>KA" was written by Plasco-Flaxman in the text management to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Maurice.
According to the New York Post, when Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman reported her case in disgrace, she threw out Maurice’s wife, and reported that their departing caregiver, who was an African-American woman, had done an evil job, and that she was expecting Philip in her stead.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Mrs. Maurice is now suing a few for compensation for being fired from her work, and she is demanding compensation of $350 a day for a period of six months, for the work of the landlord whom she was originally hired for, though without a contract.
“I want to show them that these things are not done, ” she told the newspaper Post on Friday,“ and she added,“ I know that these things are discriminatory. ”
But they are opposed to what they say is racist. They are defending themselves and defending themselves. They feared that after they had insulted her, they would no longer be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she did not want to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racist," Plasco told the Post.
“But would you give your children into the hands of someone against whom you have been rude, even though this was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
But come on."
When he compared the accusation with “extortion, ” Plasco found that his wife had a child for only two months and was in a “very difficult situation. ”
“Would you go after someone like that?
That's not a very good thing," the investment banker added.
But as the dispute continued, the public quickly condemned the couple in the social media, citing their conduct and logic.
The new letter shows that the publishers of Paddington were afraid that the readers would not have anything to do with a talking bear.
And Karen Jankel, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of this letter, It is hard to find one who has read these things before they were published, to be in the skin of one.
It is very funny to know what we know now about the great power of Paddington."
She said that her father was optimistic about the rejection of his work. Before he got the idea and wrote a children's book about a little bear, he worked as a cameraman for the BBC. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was "hot-sweet" for his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of Paddington’s success, which he describes as “a very important member of our family. ”
“He was a very quiet man, ” she said,“ and he did not give praise. ”
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who had received something. You are proud of him, even though it is not really your doing.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and his showmanship, he always credited Paddington himself. "
My daughter was dying, and I had to say good-bye to her by phone.
After the landing, she and her daughter rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors were working in vain to save her life.
"He called me regularly to tell me that it's really bad, that he's not expected to do it," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“After this, ” said Obed,“ he called me and said that he was going to die in the next two minutes, and that I must say goodbye to her.
And I did.
And I said, Tash, I love thee very much, my lover.
We'll be with you soon.
We'll be with you.
And the medicines given to her by the physicians, that they might keep her heart functioning, were slowly becoming sick, and they left her system.
She died a short time ago, and this is how it ended.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing that all these things are happening.
I could neither cry nor cry nor weep, because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on. ”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who is now grieved over the loss of her daughter, entered into the boat with the rest of the traveling men, not taking into account the sufferings she had endured.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“All the while I was bowed down and wept.
It is hard to explain, but in the midst of the flight I felt great compassion for Nadab.
I realized that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
The women on the bridge who are grieving are holding back their own lives.
Two women who came in to kill themselves for their loved ones are trying to stop the others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are building a bridge over Wales. They are using phone numbers and inscriptions that people can use to get help.
But Tyler, the son of a woman named Davis, was 13 years old when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to experience what I have to experience every day," she said.
The 45-year-old Mrs. Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him because of his laughter.
They said, “Every room in the house will be bright with his laugh. ”
But he gave up his work before he died, because he was “in a very dark place. ”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his relative after he had taken his own life.
And Mrs. Davis said, “I am constantly afraid that this will have a chain effect. ”
Mrs. Davis has prepared letters to show people that there are some people you can come to and talk to, even if they are friends.
“Don’t sit still, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Davies' longtime friend, Mrs. Humphreys, lost Mark, a partner she had been with for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
He did not say that she was feeling ill or depressed or otherwise, she said.
"A few days before Vianoce, we noticed his mood swing.
On the Sabbath day, when the children opened their gifts, he did not look at them or look at anything else. ”
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but it was necessary to go through it, saying, “This will cause a loss to the whole family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we must all continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is not the same, because the FBI will start an investigation
“I thought that if we could really get what he wanted — a time or scope of investigation — we would agree on something. ” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would fall into disarray in the midst of an obstacle.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
But the wills in the midst of the season are five weeks away, on the sixth of November; if, as it is expected, the republicans do not succeed, then they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to bring the man whom they have chosen to the highest judgment in the land.
George W. Bush was answering the phone to call the senators, lobbying to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and through him met with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI makes the administration?
In the Senate, there are 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to change the indecisive outcome and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of deserters 'decreases' under Kim's rule
The number of North Korean deserters has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago. He has led a South Korean lawgiver into the country.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 deserters last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park found that the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the higher tariffs charged by the contractors.
Pyongyang has not made any public remarks.
But most of the deserters from the north will finally be brought to the South Korean people.
Seoul says that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
But most of them will flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross that country than the DMZ, which is a heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China sees deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly returns them.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in the last months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two regions met in Pyongyang because of discussions that were aimed at a suspended denuclearization.
This came after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in the broad sense to work on a nuclear-weapon-free peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the lack of progress was due to U.S. sanctions.
“Without all confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way for us to disarm ourselves unilaterally first, ” said Lord Ri, speaking at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," says he's incapable of serving on the Supreme Court
Senate Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi did so in a Saturday interview during the Texas Rectal Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help it, but I think if a woman did this, they would say she was hysterical, ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Mr. Kavanaugh emotionally denied accusations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very emotional during his opening remarks, at times shouting and suffocating as he discussed his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him a “grotesque and coordinated type of assassination” organized by liberals angered by the defeat of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Ms. Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony would prove that he could not serve on the high court, because he was very concerned about the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself by these pronouncements and by the manner in which he persecutes the Clintonites and the Democrats," she said.
But Pelosi shrugged off, asking if she would try to bring charges against Kavanaugh, if his nominations were confirmed, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll say one thing - if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not only fit to be on the Supreme Court, but he's also fit to be on the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act, or in the case of Roe v. Wade, because she considered herself a conservative judge.
But Kavanaugh went on to question in his hearing whether he might reverse any of the judgments of the Highest Judgement.
"Isn't it time for a man who is hysterical and self-indulgent to go to court and expect us to say, 'Well, isn't this wonderful?'" she said.
And women have to control it.
This is a trial justified, and months and years of rage, which cannot be stricken, and she cannot speak without weeping.
“When we are angry, we cry, ” said Mrs. Steinem, 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
And she said, A woman who was a workwoman in a certain place helped me greatly, saying that she also wept when she was angry; and she began to use her manner of crying, because when she was angry and wept, she said to the person with whom she was speaking, “You may think that I am weeping.
I'm angry.'
And then she just kept going.
I think it's great."
Tears are, in part, permitted as a way out of anger, because they are exceedingly misunderstood.
One of my clearest recollections of my early employment in the noble office of men, where I once wept out of indescribable rage, is when my elder wife, a cold manager, whom I was always a little afraid of, took her head and stretched herself out on the stairs.
"Never let them see you weeping," she said to me.
"They don't know you're mad.
They think you are sad, and they will rejoice because they have been put under your skin. ”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart in his fight for the presidential drawing.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and ended her candidacy, deeply frustrated Mrs. Schroeder realized that there was no single reason why she should not have her own thoughts about running for president.
“It wasn’t a good decision, ” she said to me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the game, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
The campaign was long overdue, and was behind in making money, promising not to enter into the game unless it earns two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her coworkers, who had given their husbands a thousand dollars, would give her only 250 dollars.
"Do you think I'm on my left?" she asked.
And while he was saying that he was not campaigning officially, he was overflowing with emoticons, thanksgiving to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it so hard to get money and fight against voters rather than delegates.
'You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown, 'Mrs. Schroeder said to the press.
"You might have thought that the Kleenex community was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking about what I will write to the tomb.
"The one who was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The first wave of the trade war between the United States and China was deafening, and since the battle is not far off, there may be long-term gains among the countries for Beijing, say experts.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning at the beginning of this year by taxing key Chinese exports of returned solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week took place with new tariffs corresponding to items worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming to the US from China.
Beijing has paid back in the same way every time. At the last time, tariffs of five to ten percent on a cargo of $60 billion came in.
China has vowed to cope with U.S. tactics, and the world’s second-largest economy is likely to continue.
To make a concession to Washington would be to satisfy the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, the public acknowledgment of the United States would be even more painful.
However, experts argue that if Beijing plays its game well, the pressures of the American trade war could positively support China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of both economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create a conundrum that has caused economic turmoil in one of the provinces is, in fact, far more dangerous than we have previously observed," said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Asia-Pacific Center.
Syria 'prepared' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says that it is ready for the voluntary return of the refugees, and appeals for help in rebuilding the country that was desolate for more than seven years.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said in an interview with the United Nations General Assembly that the landscape would improve.
“Today, the situation here is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
But now there is every excuse for the voluntary return of the refugees to the land which they had to leave because of the terrorism and the one-sided way of living and living.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the land need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome assistance in rebuilding the devastated landscape.
But he insisted that he would not accept exchanged aid or aid from the regions that had sponsored the rebellion.
