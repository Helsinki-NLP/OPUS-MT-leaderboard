The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the preservation of the travel privilege in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region changes.
According to the press service of the government of Russia in the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the privilege to travel in public passenger transport and bring the scheme of mutual settlements on the social card in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions of its use change.
Thus, the limit of replenishment is now set not in travel as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 rubles, in summer - no more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now the holders of the social card on the receipts issued in transport will need to monitor not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the tariff applicable to the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of travel is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule of replenishment of the social card with funds remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social map will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to keep a detailed record of the spending of money on the social card with accuracy to the kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return credited, but unused funds.
We also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and the same amount is compensated by the budget of the carrier.
No commission will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of the Ivanovo Region, said that in 2014 there were more than 33 million trips in the region using a social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
In the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel of citizens using a social card, more than 470 million rubles are provided.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to the murder of a friend.
During the 911 call, Shannon Lamb, a teacher at the university, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that he needed staff to come to their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a “dog” in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found on her phone.
Inside the house, police found Amy Prentiss's body and a note casually written by hand on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm very sorry, I'd like to bring everything back, I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," the note said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who led two online courses at the University of the State of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had managed to drive 300 miles to the university campus by that time, where, according to police, he shot the respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
The head of police at Delta State University, Lynn Baford, said the university learned of the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that true 911 call shortly afterwards.
By the end of the day, the victims will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and teachers to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still trying to piece together the motives that inspired Lamb.
The information shared by investigators in both corners of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped draw a portrait of a talented but perhaps concerned teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gaultier, where Prentiss was killed, said he was not charged with violence or criminal charges.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in the book he wrote, in which he expressed gratitude for the "beautiful people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both of them taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 teachers, and many students attended lectures of both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
One student who spoke well about Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed alarmed and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year about how he struggled with stress.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in university admissions meant that the doctorate, which Lamb had worked so hard to obtain, would not guarantee him an automatic teaching position.
University President William Laforge said he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind.”
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police attacked Lamb's trail after his escape from campus as he was heading back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a 38-caliber handgun in the backyard of the house, a mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Metel Johnson said.
His engine-powered car was still standing on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to the house, although, according to Johnson, she believes that he knew the people who lived in it.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogical sciences in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as a smart, charismatic and cheerful person.
Carla Hareston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was a cool older guy who for several years tried to teach her how to play the guitar.
In those years, he enjoyed success with women.
All the girls were melting when he was around,” says Hareston, now 40, who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had probably met for some time at the time of the events.
During a 911 call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there is no record of their marriage being registered.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gauthier in a brick house, the opposite side of which overlooks the canal.
According to police, the dog is fine.
Prentice’s ex-husband, Sean O’Steen, reported that they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's totally depressed," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he hadn't met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
They played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen said his daughter was writing music and singing.
Prentiss was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Schaffer, a bartender and co-ordinator of entertainment programs at the dimly lit bar The Julep Room in the suburb of Gauthier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentiss on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few visitors.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were laughing and laughing at each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, a deceased teacher, conducted seminars for freshmen and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at the University of Kansas in Emporia and was president of the Student Fraternity and Student Self-Government.
On the University of the Delta campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university professors, staff, students and community members, participated in the candlelight memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We are trying to get our students back,” Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped to prepare the authors of the Associated Press Emily Vagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with a police statement that Lamb's call came to 911 after Schmidt's murder, and in connection with the fact that although Lamb spoke of Prentice as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many employees for the holiday season as it did last year, with a toy and baby goods retailer reassuring that it will give full-time staff and temporary staff the opportunity to work more hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, less than the 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will start interviewing applicants this month and will increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although there are still a few months before the holidays, the shopping season is approaching, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores and on the sale, shipment and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about “date” with Princess Diana
The premiere of the film “Back to the Future” turned out to be a grandiose event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the arrival of members of the royal family, I noticed that the place next to me is free, and then I was in a dream – Princess Diana will sit next to me,” he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The film begins, and then it comes to my mind that I am literally at arm's length and in one false yawn from a date with the Princess of Wales.
"Back in Time" - a documentary about the film "Back to the Future" - includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
The movie “Back to the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
“For me,” Spielberg says, “this is undeniably the greatest time-travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some cinemas in October.
The head of the UN says that there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in response to Russia’s military support for Syria that there is “no military solution” for the nearly five-year conflict, and that the increase in armaments would only exacerbate violence and suffering for millions of people.
The head of the UN once again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with foreign ministers of five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during a ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the differences in the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, “made the situation insoluble.”
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity they demonstrated in addressing the issue of Iran’s nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 Poll Results That Show Donald Trump Is Not Joking
Some tried to label him as a provocateur.
Others dismissed him as a joke.
Some people want a scandal.
But while some Republicans are trying to shake up Donald Trump’s high position in the polls, they haven’t succeeded (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump’s advantage in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously ask what this means for a real estate tycoon in terms of chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, this is only the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means Trump has a chance to nominate the Republican Party.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry gave up his advantage to the gaining popularity of Herman Kane, none of whom won a single state in the process of nomination.
And there are many reasons why he would fight in the general election.
But outside groups, such as Jeb Bush’s “Political Activity Supercommittee” and the economic conservative “Growth Club” group, recognize Trump’s unrelenting strength and start pulling out their dollars to overturn him.
Here are some survey figures that suggest that a real estate tycoon is not just an intermediate phase:
The ratings of sympathies for Trump turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll at Monmouth University found that only two out of 10 Republicans were positive about the real estate tycoon.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Now six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About 3 out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all these indicators prevail in the initial stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there are positive about Trump.
Two-thirds of those who voted for the GOP would vote for Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they were either “enthusiastic” or “satisfying” if Trump became a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they would be “disturbed” if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” against 40 percent of those who say the same about Trump).
Next in level of excitement?
Marco Rubio, who has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they will be “dissatisfied” or “disappointed” if the establishment’s favorite Jeb Bush becomes a candidate.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-facing voters across the country think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted on Monday.
The same figure appears at the country’s first closed meeting in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the same man who could be the commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he’s not the kind of person who can be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament isn’t right for the White House, according to ABC/Post reports.
Republicans are getting used to this idea.
When they put on their connoisseurs’ hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who the most likely winner of the GOP nomination was, four out of 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
This is no longer the case when four out of 10 bet Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn’t have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported a possible candidate, Mitt Romney.
However, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump’s campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of everyone else.
Some experts point out that such a scattering is likely to be Trump’s advantage, and at the same time the non-Trump supporters are evenly distributed among the supporting more than a dozen other candidates.
But a survey conducted by Monmouth University in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one competition between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets the support of the majority.
He ahead of Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and finally Rand Paul, John Kesich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a draw with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who gets around him?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by 19 points in a one-on-one hypothetical competition.
Just over half of Donald Trump’s supporters say they have changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump-backed voters say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46% say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s toughest competition at the moment is with outsider colleague neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve changed their mind are likely to choose Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump two months ago called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech, the topic of immigration has become the most topical in conversations in 2016.
Some worry that Trump’s posing will distract key Hispanic voters from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration attracts widespread attention, it seems that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Disappointment with the government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans on Monday in a new ABC/Post poll say they want a political outsider rather than a man with government experience.
And they are also offended by Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa were disappointed with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “dissatisfied” and 21 percent “outraged.”
The government will decide the fate of pension indexations in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is now looking for options for the implementation of the law on the indexation of pensions in 2016 on the real level of inflation.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, by the time of submission of the draft budget for the next year to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of extending the decision to freeze the cumulative pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion rubles.
About the same amount is the indexation of pensions in full for the next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
He believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong, at the same time, to the socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often irritated and red?
Answers the ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
Forgetting about the regular cleaning of the eyelids, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The output is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, wear a special wet wipe for the eyelids;
At least 1-2 times a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the accumulated harmful substances during the day.
Cleaning procedures are not superfluous to complement and warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (salt, chamomile), diluting the dense secretion of sebaceous glands, and then massage the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out in circular movements of the finger pads;
rinsing makeup, do not use alcohol-containing means.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to an even greater thickening of sebaceous gland secretion.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear bombers created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating "at full capacity".
The report appeared on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
The DPRK is ready at any time to respond to “the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States”, and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “both in quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was conducted by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
At the same time, plans to resume the full operation of the reactor have not been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have built a nuclear warhead.
Also, the DPRK has repeatedly tested medium and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of fraternal peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, reports the “Russian news service”.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can not stand," said Zhirinovsky.
The MP believes that it is necessary to remove all quadruples, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor replaced with the imperial flag, writes polit.ru.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether or not Europe accepts refugees, but rather that the root causes of the problem must be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
That is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue the dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as people feel completely safe.
"Thus, we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
We will remind, in the European Union this year arrived about 500 thousand migrants, including from Syria.
The European Commission said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since the Second World War.
It is possible that among the migrants arriving in Europe may be thousands of militants of the extremist group “Islamic State”.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation in order to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city organized a holiday for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has become a leader in the reception of refugees, although it has recently tightened border controls to contain their influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts say the numbers are significantly higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, whose residents give migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn will debut in the session of questions to the Prime Minister
After the election of Mr. Corbyn, his debut at the question session is expected to the Prime Minister with great impatience
Labour’s new leader Jeremy Corbyn will speak to the Prime Minister for the first time at a session of questions, for the first time battling with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six issues raised in the afternoon; his speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour members of Parliament.
He called for “less theater and more facts” in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said that he could skip some meetings, leaving them to colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr. Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader; it will take place following his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to stand silent while performing the national anthem in service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, drew criticism from a number of conservative members of parliament and became the subject of several cutting-edge newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem drew attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he was "standing in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, shadow cabinet member Mr. Corbyn Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbyn’s team, voicing disagreements on economic, defense and international politics, while less than one-sixth of members of the parliamentary party backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says the political differences are also "bumping up" in the Labour Party after Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and government restrictions on compensation payments.
Mr. Corbyn said at the Trade Unions Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at abolishing the very idea of restrictions as a whole.
A few hours later Mr. Smith, shadow minister of labor and pension payments, said that there was “full clarity” in the party that it was only in opposition to the government’s plans to cut the upper limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the “courier box” in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has “attracted collective resources” in order to gather ideas on Mr. Cameron’s issues and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament for the County of Aylington North said that the Prime Minister's questions cause unnecessary confrontation, and that he will refrain from both witty answers and exchange of sticks, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the minister of economy in the shadow cabinet, would replace him on questions from the prime minister when he was absent – for example, when Mr Cameron was abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor whenever possible, saying he had approached House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the issue.
Becoming the leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to get away from the political style of “fairy balagana”, often associated with the procedure of questions to the Prime Minister, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister’s questions have become a key indicator of the leader’s views, his ability to govern the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics say it has become a caricature and requires sweeping reforms.

Pound sterling rises as wages rise in the UK
The pound rose against the backdrop of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 rising thanks to the offer to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, earnings in the UK, minus bonuses, increased by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate was the highest since 2009, and was seen as a postponement to an earlier date of forecasts for a possible increase in quotations.
The pound grew by more than 1% against the dollar and amounted to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro, amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
Shares of SABMiller were allocated, which grew by 20% thanks to the purchase offer received from the competitor AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world’s two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% against the backdrop of encouraging news from a rival group of luxury goods manufacturers Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales data exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China – in a key market for Burberry – started to grow again.
Glencore’s shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had managed to raise $2.5 billion through a stock placement that was done as part of a debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper and packaging group shares were the leaders in the fall in the index - by 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group's rating to "sell".
Shares of JD Sports rose after the sportswear company reported an 83 percent increase in pre-tax earnings in the six months to <0xC2><0xA3>46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO Says Higher Wages Could Prevent Expansion
JD Sports CEO Peter Cougill says raising the minimum wage for British workers means “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
But such purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the increase in labor costs, he says.
The costs could have affected plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean reducing the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches grassroots initiative to counter Aldi’s attack
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food supplier has launched a campaign to protect IGA retailers’ market share in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi’s upcoming $700 million infusion.
While Aldi is preparing to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening ties with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at Adelaide Show events.
The campaign is joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as ice cream maker Simmo's from Dunsborough, which offers tastings at IGA stores, and shop owners selling discounted tickets to South Australia Football League matches to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day that this wholesale supplier of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual investor strategy day.
In South Australia and Western Australia, IGA stores account for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and Western Australia are known to adhere to the usual routes, so the market here is more favorable for IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South and 24 percent in WA compared to about 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will cede 5 percent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking the sales volume from all the players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year, and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi next year will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, achieving sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of revenue and sales of food at a high level of constant costs Metcash can cost the company about 13 million revenues before interest and taxes, said Mr. Kirat.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this despite the fact that a recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA has the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company’s market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, remarked to attendees at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash “could be highly likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to publicly comment on Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a member of Metcash’s board of directors contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash’s revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012 as a result of operational deleverance and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company does not give up, spending more than $150 million annually to align retail prices with Coles and Woolworths prices at thousands of positions per week and helping IGA retailers redesign their retail sites, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider range of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Ian Morris says price alignment and refurbishment are gaining momentum, and hopes the company will increase net profit in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanashi Kokkinakis is backed by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy.
Tanashi Kokkinakis deserves respect, not criticism, for his behavior.
Tanashi Kokkinakis has been indirectly hurt in a recent scandal over his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more credit for his behavior than critics, according to Tennis Australia President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, Jr. in a talented duo and often referred to as "Special Ks", involuntarily became the focus of attention due to Kirios' shameful quarrel with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
Shortly after that, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, a judge on the tower had to distinguish Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "Vavrinka had to put on the shoulder blades of Kiryos, and I had to put on the shoulder blades of this guy."
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racket after a seizure in his leg saved Richard Gaske from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy loyally defends Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second only to Bernard Tomich in the Davis Cup semi-finals against the UK.
“I’m deeply concerned about one thing, namely that Tanashi was involved in the conflict,” Healy said.
He really broke the racket when he lost his leg at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break the racket when the hopes were shattered, and I know Tanashi well enough to be sure he wouldn’t be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very good at himself in quite provocative situations in the US, with Harrison, etc., and I’m sure he deserves to be trusted.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, fits perfectly into the team, he has never had problems with other players, he is respected outside the court, he is training intensively, he is in excellent shape, he is a very purposeful and developed young man, and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual agreement" is the right way out for everyone, but counting on the guy from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term player.
“First of all, we want the team to fully focus on the match, not the controversy around [Kiryos],” said Healy.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray prove, he's growing up in front of the public, he's made a number of serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and it's necessary, I think, to get him out of the spotlight for a while so he can think about it better for the team, and all of it.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes border, detains migrants
Announcing the state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday blocked the border with Serbia on the southern border and detained those trying to enter the country illegally to contain the flow of migrants pouring in.
On the border there were riots - hundreds of migrants gathered in the border area, which was reacted sharply negatively by the Serbian authorities.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland broke up tents and settled in the area.
However, the dissatisfaction grew.
When a police helicopter circled over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults at the Hungarian special purpose police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister has declared it “unacceptable” to expel migrants back from Hungary as more and more of them arrive from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,” Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began a day after a bloc of 28 countries failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece and expressed hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (next month or by the end of the year) that EU member states would take in another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has gripped the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect immediate action from Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum litigation.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijj<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xB3> said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on a section of the border with Romania to block the flow of migrants through the country now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata said that even the prisoners were connected to urgent work to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become a major “narrow spot” and border crossing point for EU migrants, many of whom are refugees – victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a more prosperous life, not refugees – victims of hostilities that have the right to protection, and this view is sharply at odds with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which entered into force at midnight in Hungary, now consider it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and also include longer prison terms for people accused of human trafficking.
“Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency,” government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We make it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are at the border have been watching for several days the presence of armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs.
György Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said 45 people had been caught by authorities trying to cross the border, at the border itself, and another 15 inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of administrative violations under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly restoring the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven passages on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, driving a barbed-wire railway car to block one of the passages.
Riots broke out on the main aisle of the border near the city of Röske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service room for people to pass inside a metal container, and crowds of people pressed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to penetrate inside, while thousands of people remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced a refusal of food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernard Sanders halved in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic nominee race nationwide, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up with her.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among primary Democrats (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, gets the support of 15 percent of primary Democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the primaries, a majority of Democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton retains a great advantage among women and the moderates, but this advantage has diminished.
Her support among men has fallen significantly, and Sanders lags behind her only 5 points.
Clinton’s preference for Democratic voters under 50 has vanished, and he and Sanders are now on par with each other.
However, Clinton still has a big advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton overtook Sanders by a double-digit number among liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of the primary Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her just because she was a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
It is perhaps not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the views are more contradictory – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of primary Democrats say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republicans say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want to see her as a candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the experience she needs (16 percent), then that it’s time for a female president (13 percent), and that she’s the best candidate for that position (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also talk about an association linking her to Bill Clinton (9%).
It is also called consensus on issues and chances of election.
As the vice president contemplates a potential election turnout, 57 percent of primary-democrat voters would like him to join the race — though a third think he shouldn’t.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party’s candidates, primary Democratic voters mostly call Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half said they would have chosen Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden among the race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning a general election; however, that figure fell from 78 percent last month.
According to this indicator, Biden is in second place with a large lag, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
However, answering the question of what is most important in the candidate, the Democratic voters choose other options than the chance to be elected.
Similarly to last month’s situation, none of the Democratic or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown a good result on some key characteristics among primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden is the leader of all three in honesty, and Clinton’s strengths are in her leadership.
Thirty percent of primary-democrat voters do not think Clinton is honest and credible, twice as many as those who say the same thing about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent do not have a certain opinion about him in this regard.
Primary Democratic voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as similar.
By all these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
While questions about Hillary Clinton’s personal email inbox and server as her secretary of state continue, most primary Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general opinion of her.
But this is a completely different story for the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public opinion on this was divided back in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the controversy over email hasn’t affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10, who claim their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is seen as fair and credible by her party’s voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 percent see her as fair and credible, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than in May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, get good marks in leadership qualities.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush show the best result in honesty.
Most see Sanders as an honest man rather than not, but as Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
According to the results of the national survey Ben Carson came close to Donald Trump
Ben Carson approached Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll
The two candidates garnered half the vote in a new poll, leaving everyone else in search of a foothold.
Republican voters across the country continue to massively support Trump, whose support rate rose from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of last month’s Fox News debate to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson took off for the same period by 6% to 23%.
The poll also showed that Carson enjoyed support in all demographic groups, pushing Trump into a group of Republican voters with higher education.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, rolled back with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support fell from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio together rank third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, a poll conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll published last week showed Carson’s rise in polls — showing 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed that Trump is significantly ahead of Carson.
In connection with Carson’s growing support last week, Trump made several criticisms of the former neurosurgeon, even when Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s faith.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five Brotherhood Members Accused of Death of Baruch College First-year Student
About two years after the death of a college student during a consecration ceremony in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, the murder charge was brought against five people.
“Members of the P Delta Psi Brotherhood at New York’s Baruch College brutally attacked Chan “Michael” Deng during the initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not bring him to the hospital on time, resulting in his death,” the police said.
Officials say a student with blindfolds and a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times while he was trying to reach his goal by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng eventually complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the PI Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 when Deng lost consciousness and were waiting, presumably, an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They, however, took the time to change Deng’s clothes, find his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the Brotherhood’s national president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the fraternity members began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
“Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity initiation rituals as at least one student dies during them every year since the 1970s,” Douglas Feuerberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
Monroe County jurors bowed in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Menga, will be charged with violence against the novice and criminal conspiracy.
“We want to bring to justice not only individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized all of this officially or unofficially, then hers as well,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the nationwide fraternity excluded the local branch from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates?
There will be an increase in rates, and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will grow, and the economy will plunge into recession.
That's what we know.
What we do not know is how long it will take before the offensive, and how long it will continue.
For the economy in particular, history does not explain much about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and by as much as 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s toughness in raising rates often, but not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That’s why the US central bank administration insists that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adapt.
There are a lot of variables in the game.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
“The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of ‘cheap money,’” said Julian Jessop, chief international economics officer at Capital Economics, in his commentary to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect that the gradual return of interest rates in the US to more normal, but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here’s a look at how some areas of the economy might have reacted depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, the expectation of an increase in rates may lead to volatility for some time.
When raising the rate, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
“It doesn’t look like stock earnings will slow down 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.
More specifically, the market over the past approximately 35 years is more likely to change sharply - about 14 percent - in the direction of raising rates, remains fairly flat for 250 days after that (average growth of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Aset'en Doll, chief specialist in strategy.
Deutsche says the result for securities tends not to immediately become more pronounced at the rate hike stage, and stock earnings are beginning to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but increases in rates often play a part in them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed in conditions that did not exist before and can accelerate the recession.
Basically, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the lifetime of the increased rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases raising rates since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it is long-term, with it holding at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic background can be risky and raises the question “whether it will be different this time,” Deutsche said.
Market participants are preparing to raise rates by the Federal Reserve all year round, with their eyes fixed on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategy experts and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading shows only a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, since 1950, all cycles of rate hikes to date have been in a supercycle of increasing financial leverage at a GDP that overlaps the pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of the recovery,” the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in a selected period.
The current cycle at the moment is the longest that the Federal Reserve has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, it only lasts 74 months and is not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile while the market expects an increase in rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to that implemented for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that for bonds, the effect will come faster than for stocks, when the Federal system changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall,” Deutsche said.
Strategy experts from Charles Schwab believe that raising rates will lead to the fact that the yield levels of long-term and short-term bonds will converge, making the curve more flat.
High-yield bonds often behave better in such a climate, although “we are still afraid of yield fluctuations,” says study by Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of the Federal system’s policies.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of a tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market with the tightening of the Federal system policy.
Generally speaking, companies running their main business in the United States will benefit from an increase in interest rates, and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse off as the rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market space, and their debt more expensive in the financial space.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks are more effective than the market within three months of the initial rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Companies with stable financial standings bypassed those with unstable standings as a result of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns as well as low volatility stocks also showed better performance than low-quality stocks, an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt will be a big issue.
Companies with high floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
Investors could also see profits through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
“BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM,” says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticizes the station for “lower standards”
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was just ripped off with the Brits.
Colleague of Parliament Damien Collins, who fell for The Voice with the same criticism, was not original
“BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM,” the leader of parliament said, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the public radio station appears to be “stupid” and becoming less and less distinct from its commercial rival.
“Radio 3 seems — I don’t like using the word ‘simplification’ — but it seems to be turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, look like The Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different, here are two examples that came to mind first, in which you’re actually just copying what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s CEO has denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn through Radio 3, I don’t learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and making music is not really comparable to anyone else.
“It’s also really important, I think, Radio 3’s interest in finding new music and promoting new works,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davie claimed that the radio station had to work much harder to attract an audience than in the past, because the British are less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of the BBC who was attacked for attacking commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a music talent show the BBC bought from Dutch Talpa Media for an estimated price of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed due to the lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to “find a hit in its own home stable” the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not consider it necessary to prevent the order of new seasons of The Voice in the future or use the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
The growth of online sales slowed as much as possible in August, and the blame for this may be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales intensified three years ago due to the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts are convinced that November Black Friday could have contributed to the deterrence of spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain’s central streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a levelling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed a minimal increase since it began to be recorded in 2000, increasing by only five percent.
Experts say there are now signs of a levelling of online sales, after the latest data showed only a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000, they’ve always found a reasonable explanation,” Andy Malkahi, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that even more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do it in any conditions, such as sitting on the couch.
But now it comes out on the plateau, and you can see a decrease (growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying on the eve of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers rushed to computers to take advantage of profitable offers, thus crashing a number of sellers’ websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers enter a real fight for profitable purchases, could force people to refrain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 out of every 5 is spent online.
As for products such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more willingly than in fashion stores on the central streets.
Muslims bury dead after crane falls in Mecca, Bin Laden’s family sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead in the streets, as the first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partially blamed the accident on the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims killed in the collapse of a crane at the main mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, attendees flooded the roadway to pay homage to the first of the dead who went on their last trip to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad procession passed by the holy place, where just a few days earlier a construction crane pierced the ceiling of the mosque and fell on the parishioners.
The bodies were handed over for burial, and at the same time the King of Saudis fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 parishioners killed in the collapse of the crane in the main mosque, carried through the streets
Among the dead was the father of four children, Kasim Akram of Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was at the Main Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj in Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
King Salman said today that Binladin Group should not have left the crane's arrow raised when the crane was not working.
The Arab version of the decree, published by the state agency Saudi Press, says that Binladin Group bears partial blame for the collapse.
The English edition of the news agency did not tell about this detail, but said that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out the reason for the fall of the crane in the courtyard of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked to go to the Hajj this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements about the collapse of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of failing to use modern security measures and improper coordination of actions with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca, as part of the large-scale construction work carried out by Binladin Group.
Bin Laden’s family has been one of Saudi Arabia’s closest ruling families for decades and has been leading major construction projects.
The late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was the son of an impostor whom the family renounced in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in strong winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rials (about <0xC2><0xA3>174,000) to the relatives of the victims, and the same amount was irretrievably crippled.
The remaining victims will receive half of this amount.
The head of B&Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European masters working for little money
According to Veronica Laurie, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result - the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Author: Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is said that the British put aside hammers and paint brushes, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do the work in the house.
If you know how to handle a hammer or skillfully paint walls, it seems that these days you are in the minority.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, the British are increasingly hiring skilled craftsmen to do simple housework.
Veronica Laurie, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a network of home improvement services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe, offering services at minimum prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen’s goods, and at the same time close 60 B&Q warehouse stores.
Ms. Laurie said she would like to see more women in the staff of B&Q stores, as eight out of ten decisions about shopping in the store are made by the weaker sex.
Currently, most of the staff are men.
According to her, the recent demographic trends, characterized by the growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more engaged in the arrangement of their homes than in the past, should not be overlooked.
Ms. Laurie said: “We still have men working in our stores.
Steps must be taken to achieve a balance.
In total, half of our customers are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions about the goods purchased are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of leading British companies whose shares are listed in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top management team, achieving an equal number of male and female directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50 percent of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms. Laurie said: “It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board of directors was easy.
After the group took over the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher showed a decline in profit and sales in six months.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new stores
Time of decision on the interest rate of the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching a meeting of the Federal Reserve Bank, which for two days discusses the most important decision - whether to raise the interest rate for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who last week believed the Federal Reserve would go for it now believe it would still delay and keep the rate at the current range of 0-0.25%.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the fact that the main bank can move from zero and start the process of normalizing interest rates,” said <0xC3><0x81>ngel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is working efficiently, the economic recovery adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is small.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets that they should prepare for change, but it all speaks to their confidence that all chances are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are going to the EU through Croatia.
“Open up!” chanted hundreds of refugees at the Horgos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border for IDPs.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to experience other options for routes to the European Union.
One of them, bypassing the closed border with Serbia, lies through Romania.
The other - through Croatia and Slovenia - to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of <0xC5><0xA0>id on the Croatian border.
Drivers were ordered by the authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbian Interior Minister Neboj<0xC5><0xA1>a Stepanovi<0xC4><0x87> says his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to secure Serbia as much as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure a humane attitude towards them.
But this is already a pan-European problem.
It is not easy to solve it, no country in Europe alone can cope with it, and even more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n is relentless:
If someone calls himself a refugee, he must fill out the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, then he will not be allowed into our country, because it is quite safe in Serbia.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban does not intend to stop there: he plans to build the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: “Europe wants to help us.”
Vangelis Meimarakis has been part of the center-right governments for years, which leftists believe have led the country to a financial crisis.
Now that he has become the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with journalist Euronews.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, welcome to Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, yielding to the SYRIZA coalition, but now, according to polls, the New Democracy has equaled it in popularity.
What has changed during this time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country again has a budget deficit and a high unemployment rate.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras drove them away.
Over the past nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation in which the country was in January, and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised to what actually happened.
Daily life became noticeably worse than in January, when the situation improved, and this affected most Greek citizens.
Euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have understood in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is no coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have agreed without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that at this stage only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of the agreement between Mr Tsipras and the creditors of the country.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you implement this agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted to move Greece on the European path because we have a good idea of what the disastrous consequences of leaving the EU would be.
Now Europe is helping us by providing subsidies to our farmers for their products, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All this would have been lost had there not been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that the new Greek government in its first year in power wants to restore order, acts rationally and makes it clear that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments made, which cannot be fulfilled because of what leads to a recession, can again be negotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be wrong to believe that in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to restore their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed upon, while continuing to take advantage of EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we found out when discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
Let me give you an example of farmers’ income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that the Tsipras ministers never spoke about it.
That is, the Greek ministers were not prepared and poorly informed, and therefore unsuccessfully negotiated and concluded a failed agreement.
Euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table with Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to implement the 2012 agreement in the best way, bypassing the sharp corners that it had.
We are moving forward with reforms.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price that the Greek government was pleased with.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I was able to agree on the views of the three parliamentary groups that constituted the government majority at the time.
And despite their serious ideological differences over key bills, we had a working parliament, and this was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations that took place outside.
And we managed to bring the country to a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: In recent weeks, a mass flow of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation and the reaction of the European countries to which these people are striving?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time-bomb that we have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the SYRIZA government has not acted in this situation as it should have.
In such matters, you should act ahead of time, because if the problem catches up with you, then only emergency measures remain.
And that's exactly the situation we're in now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the interim government, which is provided with valuable assistance by the President of the Republic, who called for an EU summit, will allow to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees will be able to leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary events that happened to them.
This issue has a deeply humanitarian aspect, and we will stick to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to tackle this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maymarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka of the Donetsk region within a day, officers of the criminal investigation of the Main Directorate of the police of the region together with military counterintelligence established and detained the suspect, who was a 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Kryvyi Rih (Dnepropetrovsk region), who the previous evening during the joint use of alcoholic beverages, and a conflict arose in the

The man who opened the shooting at the University of the State of Delta, left a note with an apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was “sorry” for the first murder and would “want to get everything back,” authorities said on Tuesday.
Police in the city of Gautier, Mississippi, reported that a professor of geography and social sciences at the University of the Delta State, called 911 at about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "would not touch anyone," but was probably upset.
The police asked the name of the caller, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
Arriving at the crime scene, police found Amy Prentiss's body, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, stating, "I'm sorry I'd like to take it all back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to the University of Delta, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and committed suicide on Monday evening when he was surrounded by police.
University rector William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but “Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind.”
Despite Monday's announcement that Lamb was contemplating an affair between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported a "lack of any information or evidence" of the "love triangle".
Prentiss was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O’Steen said he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter and that she is “uncomfortable.”
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the San Herald newspaper calls a close friend of Prentiss, the latter worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She's always wanted to help people."
According to police, Lamb on Monday at some point called relatives to say that "he will not go to prison."
On the evening of the same day when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself there.
According to a summary posted on the university website, in the spring of 2015, Lamb received a doctorate in pedagogy from the University of the State of Delta.
The Stars Who Lost Their Fortune
The actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001, he struggled with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his long-time life partner Farru Fawcett, who died of cancer.
The actor reportedly also suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly played a role.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United has been sacked for several months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried that he won't be able to get on the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless 15-minute run when 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after and then operated on.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame great difficulties and began to play fantastically, and here it happened.
He was wearing an oxygen mask in his dressing room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's six months, and the guy can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky that he did not receive a red card and was not awarded a penalty.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes that the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
Shaw tweeted: “Thank you all for your messages, words do not describe how devastated I am, my path to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.”
Manchester United suffers misfortune with Luke Shaw after defeat in the game with PSV
The defender of the British will have an additional incentive to recover for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Koku, a PSV coach, said: “This is a very serious injury.
When any player leaves with a similar injury, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
“It’s very difficult for him right now because he had no intention of hurting the enemy, and when you hear that it’s a very serious injury, you feel bad,” Koku said.
I couldn’t see the moment.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) had touched it, but I didn’t see a podcast under Luke.
In an interview with SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear it.
It's really hard for me, and I'm sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a collision with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child liked a book, it will take a little time before you know it almost by heart.
Unless, of course, you're David Cameron.
Asked by a representative of the company that organizes children's holidays, about his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose "Lorax" - a fairy tale with an environmental bias, written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on SuperCamps' website, and continues: "This fun, touching, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
And everything would be fine, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book, but actually tells the plot of the eponymous film, shot in 2012, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled town of All-Noughtville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see the real tree," reads a description of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Hayes) in 1991.
If it doesn’t look suspicious enough, Cameron’s text reads almost like a summary of the plot of the film “Lorax”, posted on the Internet Movie Database website: “In the high-walled town of Omnibusville, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
It seems unlikely that Cameron, being, by general admission, an active parent, so unfamiliar with the contents of the book, in which the unnamed boy learns about how the environment is destroyed by the greedy tree-cutter and knitting "omnipotent" Nachodkins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is taken away from him)
Most likely, such a simple PR task was entrusted to the performer, who had never read a book about Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokesperson said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron’s office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment was received.
Adam Litt clearly had a risk of not getting into England, but it’s still a difficult question.
Winning Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is not an easy task, but if you look at the team that England selected for this tour, repeating the 3-0 defeat in the test series that happened last time, it does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my field either.
Aleister Cook’s team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players among the rebounders who are virtuously accepting twisted balls, and collective thinking is strong; they will not bring with them the 2012 scars, but only a youthful positive.
With the ball, Moen Ali turns into a bowler serving twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, is an attacking option.
Adam Lit retired from the England national cricket team and was replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lite is difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said this before) players are best at choosing themselves.
A couple of half a hundred, and Lita could have waited for a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England head coach Trevor Bayliss spoke well of his mood, even when he did not show what he was capable of, and this does not surprise me; he is first of all a team player, and then everything else.
The question of how long it will take before the batsman of the test cricket leaves an impression is a difficult question.
Litt played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's field.
The only thing you could complain about is that England chose Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Litt was in the best shape, but that lost opportunity is over.
Alex Hales shows up, and he's a batsman that I highly appreciate.
He’s an unpredictable cricketer, which we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season, when he made 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was something.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who were before him, but it will, of course, depend on the composition of the team in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an opening batsman, which would give the opportunity to introduce an additional spinner, retaining four high-speed bowlers, is considered, and I am not against it at all.
I don't see any reason why a beating player can't hit the ball there, and this left-hander has already shown that he's a damn good cricketer.
Moen may not be exactly what you need for your county of Worcestershire, but it has become the third number for them, and there is no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches as a "third batsman" before coming out as an opening in 2001.
He won $300 and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the national team as a backup spinner, and during my short conversation with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his exemplary statistic — an average of 31 with a bat and 35 with a ball — and think it’s a risky bet, but among spinners voting for a little bit, and pickers chose youth.
He will learn a lot from this tour.
In addition to the national team, England plans to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayauordin, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a test match consultant, could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys to play, which will bring to it the richest experience, gained in all possible conditions and in any attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those games where the white ball is used, and will provide both energy and merciless pace in the set-up.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it was a game or a coaching job, and like Mahela, he has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what has been said before, can give the team new strength.
Colley's teammate, Durham Ben Stokes, has been left for a day, Ruth has been given a similar break in connection with Australia, and I, for example, have no problems with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and players don’t set the timetable.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy to make.
The camp of supporters of Britain’s exit from the European Union may win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is experiencing more and more difficulties every day, even without regard to the election of the brilliant Jeremy-"Is it yes or no?"- Corbyn as the Labour leader or TUC's resentment over Europe on Tuesday.
The foreigners also have their own Corbins and Nigels Faraji.
A friendly European diplomat recently explained that given the current situation of the EU, which is experiencing a variety of crises - not all of them of its own making - some member countries are fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda of sowing concessions and undermining agreements, which they mostly do not want.
Having gathered in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC decided that it did not want them in any way if they were destroying social protection.
We could even call it "Dave and George's selfie program."
The prime minister and finance minister ride around summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, photograph themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, in the company of a local celebrity or without it, then come home and say that they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants Britain interested in maintaining external contacts under the awning of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - proposes that shoddy ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation worsens for her, as she worsens for those sitting in her place Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to see them crawling out of their skin out to help “selfie Brits” whose energy could be spent preventing Scotland from leaving the UK – which they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even plan to issue intentionally useless SNP-style tags during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the UK’s exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The revision was an idea-fix" and "Britain received nothing of value from the resumption of negotiations."
Europeans know what kind of predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical media tycoons are about the EU, unlike in the time of Tony Benn’s 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, an entrenched Euro-opportunist who became famous for his Brussels correspondent’s “EU direct bananas” in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of fearful tax swindlers, phone hackers-foreigners and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion about them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a violent gorilla, you should give her bananas to distract her and prevent her from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was a greater supporter of Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's idea of a referendum, as Blair gave up the principles in favor of the repealed EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him a winning ticket.
The press did not forgive him.
But sweet Jeremy Corbyn, who friendlyly slapped me on the back in Westminster on Monday — I told him he no longer had time to spend it on me — seems to be at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock’s 1980s “Murdoku boycott” strategy — a mistake both then and now.
It may take a while, but he has to develop a consistent strategy to interact with the press — not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marr, on whose couch in the Air Force he was sitting on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside of the Ukip traditionalist trend and the wider range of “Little England supporters” among the Tories may probably say yes to this.
That's the same thing that Hillary-"Benn, but not Benn"-Benn said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the intolerable John McDonnell as shadow finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father struggled on TV for disloyalty to his colleagues in the Labour cabinet, without going too far and without losing his post in the Cabinet.
Hilary's battle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s phrase — is not what McDonnell said, nor is it what J.K. told peers and members of parliament in a private meeting on Monday night, according to popular opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and “his boyfriend” Corbyn wanted to say – remember, he touched even me – the discipline of messages remains important in the age of 24-hour television seven days a week, and especially in the whirlpool of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s wise not to let Cameron get away from Europe so easily, allowing him to accept Labour’s support as due during the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s main misconception about EU membership – within the “Bennite” economy of the besieged fortress – is no longer a question of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for whom the narcissism generated by the slight distinction is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about Nato – Tom Watson is unshakable in the fact that J.K. will not campaign for an exit – foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when all this may be pointless?
The United States is already very disappointed by the weak military actions of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the Tory government is cutting spending, as I was reminded on Monday during a luncheon at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
The government-funded agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with Lancet criticized the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report – a “turning point” last month, calling it a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and pointed to the connection of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the “extremely shaky argument” on the basis of which PHE built its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these statements had “solid or sluggish grounds.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: “The fundamental principle of health is that rules should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
According to them, the public expects PHE's statements that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than tobacco" to be based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this is derived from a single meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria decision-making analysis model to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed BAT health certifications in the Sustainability Report.
One in 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette maker, without mentioning the funding he reportedly had previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of council members has not been provided, but among them there are several well-known supporters of e-cigarettes, some of whom have also claimed industry funding in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants in the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco industry at PHE.
The scientific paper, published by the group, "delicately agrees" that there is a lack of "strong evidence of the harmful effects of most products by most criteria," wrote McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke,” were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, head of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s statements had already been answered.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than tobacco smoking.”
One in two smokers has died of addiction their entire lives.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term consequences.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public about what is and is not being proven by this evidence, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related diseases, and smoking costs the NHS <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly pointing out the obvious – that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they only inflict part of the harm caused by smoking – we are fulfilling our tasks before the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes that the BBC should stop the series EastEnders
Luke Johnson, the former head of Channel 4, believes the BBC should stop releasing programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the Albert Square soap opera.
Johnson noted that licensing fees should only be used to create programs that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting on public broadcasts, which probably only a small part of the audience watches, on peak airtime, when competitors have high-rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the corporation would like to collaborate more with other organizations, Johnson remarked that he had tried unsuccessfully for six years to collaborate with the BBC while working on Channel 4.
“I can’t help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasting shows that could be shown by competing companies that don’t receive subsidies,” Johnson told members of the House of Lords’ Communications Committee as part of an investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you keep the license fee, which I do not consider a good solution in the medium and long term, then companies should only leave on the air those programs that are not released and are not going to be released by other companies.
The Voice show is aired in the prime slot because the creators want to get the maximum possible support for the future.
The idea of no one else showing it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: “I don’t understand why regressive taxes should go to fund transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is well known that they are of their own production.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this can be a public broadcast.
I don’t think that would have degraded the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of the employees and because of their belief that this is the best way to get support for the long term."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echoed those of Sky's CEO Tony Ball, who, in his 2003 McTaggart Memorial Lecture in Edinburgh, proposed that the BBC sell EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the BBC's more niche public broadcasts "continue to go to BBC4, where it is often impossible to evaluate the audience, but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be presented as an argument in the hymnalistic sermons justifying the revenue from the license fees of <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion: "Well, yes, of course, we are doing all these incomprehensible broadcasts."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licensing fee, Johnson told the committee: “I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom <0xC2><0xA3>150 is a lot of money, I wonder, they think so because they don’t really watch and listen to the BBC.
David Elstein, a former Sky and Channel 5 executive who also spoke to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should review Rita’s mission in favor of “informing, educating and entertaining.”
He noted that now only a small part of the BBC's material is formally classified as educational - he said it is 1% of television content and 0.1% on radio - and that the company should take the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the motto "inform, enlighten and entertain".
On partnership issues, Alstein noted that the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as “Promenade Concerts” (only part of them, he said, are shown on TV), as well as enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonogenetics" allows you to control brain cells with the help of sound waves
In the video, you can see how the nematodes change the direction of movement at the moment when they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have removed worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using the pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction of movement at the moment when they are affected by sound impulses too high for the human ear to hear them.
Pulses act by activating neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
RELATED: Researchers control brain activity with light
The scientists said that the worms demonstrate the possibilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics", the essence of which is to use ultrasound to excite certain cells of the brain, heart and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a research fellow at the Salk Institute in La Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation — an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson’s disease.
Nematode worms usually do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate into the body of the worms.
Reinforced ultrasonic waves affect structures called “TRP-4 ion channels” found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani made genetic modifications to worms, so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to affect modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into the organisms of worms, activating modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to the one used in "optogenetics" - a new direction that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that compared to this technique, sonogenetics can have some advantages.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain via fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves pass through the tissues of the body unimpeded, so for their delivery does not need to go inside the skull.
"We believe that for the treatment of some neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will be able to make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal for a time," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.
Prohibited equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements mock British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting against the exhibition of weapons.
Stunning killer drones!
The shin-destroying iron cuffs!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and cartoon animation leave no doubt that this advertisement for the largest international arms exhibition is a spicy parody prepared by Amnesty International with the aim of drawing attention to the British government’s intention to “push” weapons to repressive regimes, taking advantage of the exhibition of defense technologies and security systems taking place at the ExCeL center in Docklandes.
DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authoritarian Regimes Go to London
But a special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a lot of posters at bus stops and on subway trains, which require you to look at them again.
"An important announcement going on the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" - written in one of them in the fonts of the London subway with the image of the DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will heat up on the DLR line. Passengers are asked to help prevent the exhibition of weapons.
300 posters were painted by artists who exhibited their works at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy’s Dismaland Park.
A team called Special Patrol helped spread them around London, using a “set of ad-site intruders,” a 6-pound wrench set that is said to “give access to about a third of the advertising space at the planet’s bus stops.”
Transporters in London are not happy with such “vandalism” in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parody announcements issued by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to an audience outside of galleries.
Many artists start working with protest movement activists, realizing that they have to go out into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons, welcoming passengers in the subway.
The video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and created by VCCP, a pro bono agency, with a graphic designer and voice artist also working for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms show — with a pass in the ExCel calendar — and thought, “Let’s get them a campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They thought of creating more realistic and ingenious corporate advertising, but "filling it at home with bright colors and animation was more exciting."
“They have incredibly helped us draw attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this exploratory equipment is not sold illegally right at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the arms exhibition comes from the inside of ExCeL, where participants sell fantastically euphemestic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed information about the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" received from the U.S. Army.
It includes “unparalleled cumulative warheads that bring unrivalled reserve action inside the target.”
No matter what he does, it won't be pleasant.
Eight golden rules of living in student dormitories
It’s been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old who still believes in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed — and the numerous, long grievances against others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from slightly acting on the nerves to absolutely frightening.
He encourages you to talk: tell people where you came from, whether you took your academic leave and where you spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you "honestly, do not love, do not hate Marmait, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I'll be at home."
Take a break.
And help others rest too - ask questions and show interest.
This keeps you talking and helps you find the people you like, not the ones you wouldn’t even talk to, even if your eyelashes were lit and they were giving out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and common hangouts, but they’re also a place where people dress up and fix their underwear.
Don’t even think about starting a university while in a relationship.
Introverts in universities are treated unfairly.
Your room should be a refuge, however, many hostels form a culture of wandering from one room to another, which promotes friendship, communication and leads to long friendships.
It can be hell for someone who is trying to restore strength.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want to keep being friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can restore the energy I spent on communicating with you.”
Try to feel when a classmate is tired of communicating - and not to knock on him, but to send an SMS.
By the way, about knocking: do it.
A guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends with baking.
As you begin university life at the peak of Bake-Off’s popularity, knocking on people’s doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is no longer such a strange action, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their “Welcome, we’re neighbors, I’ve baked you something, and now smile, and I’ll ask you personal questions.”
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to talk to you, and in the end, your face will probably be associated with them with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly glued lumps of flour, sugar and fat will rather make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on them.
Theft of food is a typical crime in student dormitories.
Of course, embezzling someone's chicken is stealing, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
Take care of the owner of the milk.
Most likely, he will offer you not to be shy, even if the inside is boiling with rage.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more adult than my neighbor who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to get revenge on those who took it without asking.
She's in jail now.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from the saying about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked the neighbor to reduce the sound of the drum and bass guitar, since it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the volume.
When he finally shut up at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then hammered in her music and locked the door behind her, going for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn’t it be extraordinary, before biting your elbows, clumsy, if you took your neighbor as your future spouse, got involved with him, broke up with him, and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him drag all your common friends to his side?
Of course, you will not order the heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to slightly cool your own heat.
The moment you realize that someone has left the keys inside their locked room, the line between pranks and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never stuff someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close someone else’s door and put the keys in a glass of water, which you will then put in the freezer – but do not glue someone else’s things with Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on the iPhone after the release of the update from Apple
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then selecting Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "App update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the recovery slows down or try to update via iTunes.
The tips on the phone will allow you to go through the whole process to the end.
The process may involve deleting apps to increase free space – but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and has also made it easier to perform with a dedicated utility that offers to remove apps and reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that when you perform an update, your phone is charged or is next to the charger to prevent the battery from being discharged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the discharge of the phone in the process may lead to a failure of the update.
iOS 9 comes out as planned, despite the delay WatchOS Review iOS 9: the least impressive and best update to iOS 9: how to prepare for the new operating system for the iPhone
You should make sure you review our checklist of those actions you need to take before downloading to try and make something stop going wrong, and protect yourself from that something if something went wrong. iOS 9 now includes new features, including an improved personal assistant, and innovations that boost iPad performance, and settings that increase speed.
Washington responded to Russia’s military activity by telephone.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, the military support that Moscow provides to President Assad only leads to an escalation of the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with a Russian colleague, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia’s military activities in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that continued Russian support for President Assad poses a risk of escalation and prolongation of the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal — the fight against extremism — unless we also continue to focus on finding ways to resolve the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power,” the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
They also noted that Kerry once again stressed the US commitment to the fight against the Islamic State in the framework of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad will never be able to be a member of it.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to confront the Islamic State.”
On Friday, White House officials said they did not know exactly what actions Russian troops are taking in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
White House press secretary Josh Earnest said it was not yet time for a phone call between U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin: “When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin will benefit our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call.”
Barack Obama himself considers Russia’s decision to increase support for the Assad regime a “loser bet.”
I remember talking to Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
“But he didn’t listen to my warnings – and as a result the situation worsened,” he said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sports from paying customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on behalf of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Lashkina.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following a trip to Crimea, instructed a number of departments - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the FTS, Rosturizm - to prepare proposals on creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their ships abroad - about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million annually go to the treasury of European states for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On amendments to the List of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes", providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating goods for recreation and sports.
According to the ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was referred to the subcommission on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Governmental Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and was also approved by the agencies following the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release at importation is inherently a concession.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, sports cars, magazines, goods necessary to facilitate foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for application in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control and measuring devices, equipment for measuring purposes.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared mandatory regulations on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of the entrance and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure vessels to the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has given instructions to the captains of the seaports of the Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small-sized, sports sailing and recreational vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
Also, the Ministry of Transport prepared draft orders of the Russian government on the approval of the boundaries of the water area of the sea ports of Crimea.
Regarding Yalta and Feodosia, the orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the stage of coordination, the press service of the department noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, state supervision, classification and certification, state registration in respect of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes, should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, then there is a whole constantly developing industry in which a large number of people are involved.
In Russia, in fact, everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big difficulty is that in this area extremely strict rules of the border service: in order to go for a walk on the yacht, you need to issue a lot of permits.
In addition, inside Russia, the yacht even has nowhere to refuel.
She can go with her fuel for two days, and then the problem arises where to get it, - says the sales director of the company Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
As for the storage of yachts, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts up to 30 m. Also, yachts are sent for storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novikov noted that yacht buyers are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts decreased.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine a loan of $ 500 million.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine.
World Bank Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine Tsimyao Fan said that banking sector reforms will help revive loans in the real economy and stimulate the recovery of economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan calls on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved the provision of a loan of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgender people.
At the Public Council under the Federal Service for the Execution of Penalties (FSIN) for the protection of the rights of convicts in October 2015, among other issues will discuss the possibility of creating separate blocks in the colonies for transgender people and transvestites.
Vladislav Grib, a member of the council, told Izvestia about this.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicts in Russia, it is possible to provide for individual cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transgender people.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine the punishment of citizens in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed appropriate medical examinations, which will prove that the perpetrator is really a person who identifies himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice is successfully operating abroad: in the prison (where the accused are before the court decision) there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special units.
Today, this is the only way to deal with such criminals.
They definitely need to be isolated, since the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a sea of problems for FSIN employees.
The humiliation of trances by fellow inmates is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large the city is, how many criminals with an undetermined gender, it is necessary to calculate where to distribute them.
Prisons do not need separate ones - only cameras, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As explained by Grib, the block can contain 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized corps will be created in Russia one, then prisoners of transsexuals will be able to go there from any region.
Citizens are detained in the detention center at the place of the crime, so the receipts of transvestites or transgender people from other entities during the investigation and trial are unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, - says Grib.
We will remind, the day before law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to determine the detained for possession of drugs 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), because of which the man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a no-departure subscription.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and the media, as the mechanism for the content of transgender people in pre-trial detention centers and colonies in Russia does not yet exist.
Russian human rights activist, LGBT activist (LGBT - lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) Nikolay Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it is also possible to define people in the colony - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, - says Alekseev.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be done in the name of this and for homosexuals, especially since there are more in prisons than transgender people.
At the same time, Alexeyev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate transsexuals in order to get into a colony different from ordinary ones.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in colonies for transgender people, but not always everything is clear.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners Chelsea Manning looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wants to change the sex, - said Alexeyev.
A person can feel like anyone.
But while there are no separate places for transgender people to serve their sentences, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the intricacies of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, the international expert on reproductive health in the territory of the Russian Federation Boris Lordkipanidze noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transgender criminals in the colony can greatly delay the beginning of serving sentences by convicts.
A commission is created - this is a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, this is not one test on the basis of which a high-precision conclusion is made.
Today’s psychiatry allows it.
Therefore, even before sex change, potential patients are always undergoing such examinations - they accurately indicate whether sex change with surgery is a necessary measure, - says Lordkipanidze.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how to implement this system in relation to convicts, because on average such a survey takes a month.
The doctor, despite the fact that in general the idea of creating separate blocks for transgender people was supported, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender people in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, we can say that there are even fewer transgender people, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes, a small number, - said Lordkipanidze.
Now, at the request of the colony administration, homosexuals, transgender people can get separate conditions of detention.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk ended the world championship in chess among juniors under 20 years.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Yan-Kshishtof Duda, who seemed confidently went to the title.
The girls’ victory was celebrated by Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buxa.
The World Chess Championship, held from the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to lose almost all the intrigue, as the representative of Poland Jan-Kszysztof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (competition is held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently seized the leadership.
Given that Duda was a favorite of the championship, and generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the gap was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed the Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to only 0.5 points, he remained an obvious favorite in the fight for the title.
After all, Antipov, in order to catch up with the leader, it was necessary to win in the 13th round.
But even that wouldn't help, win Duda your game.
Plus, this obligation to win, of course, could affect the game of the Russian chess player and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He confidently coped with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait for Duda to complete his party, meeting with Benjamin Bock.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player drew a draw against the Dutch.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
Therefore, the leadership of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, the governor of which Natalia Komarova traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But in the competitions of the girls an intriguing ending did not happen.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she successfully did.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Books.
The Russian athlete was second with a gap of 0.5 points from the champion.
It changes the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one consolidated Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to Mikhail Slobodin, CEO of VimpelCom, the changes are being made to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop the company “in new, not always favorable external conditions”.
In an interview with Rossiya 24 TV channel, Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce “tens of percent” of personnel in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor checked 78 Moscow Burger King diners and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on the Volokolamsk highway was fined 50,000 rubles, and the restaurant on Bolshaya Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after the elimination of all violations.
43 diners violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary and hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for the ventilation device, bacteria of the E. coli group were found in some institutions.
The franchise for the Burger King brand belongs to Burger Rus LLC, the owner of the Chocolatnitsa network, Alexander Kolobov, there are 293 diners in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, the head of the FAS, said that the agency is against indexing 10% of tariffs for cargo transportation and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by JSC RZD.
At first, they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, and also multi-billion dollar subsidies from the budget, he says.
We say: this is wrong, this is too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, “much stricter” proposals, which are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a put option on shares for the full amount of $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the price of the issue of shares in favor of Sumeru and market quotations), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to implement the option or request an additional payment.
Details of the negotiations at Polymetal are not disclosed.
The option was concluded as part of the purchase of Polymetal project "Kyzyl" in Kazakhstan.

The Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not be an analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia Viktor Evtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be analogous to the card system of distribution of food existing in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food assistance to the population and support of an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the word "food card."
I would especially like to note that it is not necessary to confuse the proposed food cards with the echo of past times of total deficit, a card distribution system in which the number of products received is normalized.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation," Mr. Yevtukhov said.
Earlier, "Kommersant" wrote that the program for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced to the government.

This year, the study of the Association of Russian Managers "Top 1000 Russian Managers" comes out for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers for the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year’s rating winners.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate of the rating of the current year and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list is proposed to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, which it would be advisable to add to the general pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following managers of the functional areas of the company: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, HR Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Relations with Authorities, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each proposed by experts manager is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate their management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of candidates on the basis of the industry principle is carried out on the basis of the industry classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and woodworking industry, mechanical engineering, media business, metallurgy, multidisciplinary holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, transportation, trade
Each participant is provided with a login and password to log into the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information about other participants and can make their assessments according to the proposed criteria for each functional direction.
The methodology of rating construction is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows you to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
All wishing candidates of the rating of the current year and multiple candidates of the rating of past years are invited to full-time meetings of expert commissions.
The commissions are organized on a functional basis: the commission for approval of the list of senior managers and eight commissions for approval of heads of functional directions.
At the meetings of expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the online assessment and are closed information before the publication of the rating) or to make updating their adjustments according to the attached list of standby candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of "Kommersant".
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year fell by 40%.
What do you think the situation is today?
After the panic at the end of 2014 - the beginning of 2015, SME lending volumes decreased significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp increase in interest rates.
Loans below 25-30% per annum were not beneficial to anyone.
If earlier the bank could put in an increased rate all its possible problems in the future, from delays to non-refunds, now it is impossible to do it: rates and so cloudy.
For business, the current level of SME loan rates is uncomfortable.
For a significant part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How much do you think the demand for loans is being met?
After the lowering of the CB interest rate, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers began to apply for loans much less often.
First of all, the business does not understand the prospects of its development and future revenues.
Today, business has one solution: it is necessary to learn how to work, focusing on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the movement of money.
At the same time, if there are financial resources, it is worth using new technologies that allow to modernize equipment, reduce production costs and energy supply.
All this, ultimately, allows the company to make products more competitive and keep the business even in an unstable economic situation.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and affect its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate will largely depend on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans for SMEs should not be expected.
In the current situation, the problem, first of all, is inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to generate real income.
In addition, the cost of money in Russia will remain high even if the rates of the Central Bank are reduced.
If we talk about the level of overdueness, then traditionally small and medium-sized companies, limited both in the possibilities of replenishment of funds and in the options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country’s economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So and the new crossover CX-5, as well as any other model of the brand: without cunning attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese simply because of its "Japaneseness" is able to bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of complete delight.
You can give as many arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and the person even in principle will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will disintegrate from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
Quoting from the course of Base, spice up food wasabi, collect katanas and dress your girlfriend - no, not in kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Perhaps, the Japanese school uniform is the only form that girls wear with pleasure even after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and strict.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the grille of the radiator with five horizontal lines.
But much more changes the appearance of the car a new pattern of headlights and rear lights, by which the car instantly recognizes in the flow of cars.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms are sensual, but the appearance at the same time has a tinge of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
At the wheel of the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, you can experience only Stoic Japanese tranquility.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine delivers high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this engine with a capacity of 175 hp is only 5.9 l. The power unit is equipped exclusively with automatic transmission and all-wheel drive.
Black shoes, black cloak, black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not get behind the wheel of the CX-5 on the spot of your own accident.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the design of the front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimized the shape of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system has been adapted to Russian conditions.
The noise level from the road and engine at high speeds was reduced by 13%.
A swimsuit in a flower or stripe is as boring as a budget sedan.
It’s a different matter if the girl is poking around in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
She will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design of both the front and rear seats, which provides an optimal margin of space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has what.
Even the long-legged will surely appreciate the fact that the supports in the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in expressions.
Mazda’s widest range of active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
In order to recognize the potential threat, radars, lasers and cameras are used here.
There's adaptive lighting here, and warnings about getting off the lane, and monitoring dead zones, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunks in its class.
Convenient, with a minimum of protrusions, it accommodates a load of 561 liters. The rear seats fold in a proportion of 4:2:4 - each section is equipped with a separate pull-out lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon hero in Japan is called "Kigurumi".
The kigurumi-pyjamas are particularly striking.
Everything is possible in it!
To sleep, of course.
But also to entertain small children.
Or just walk around with a beast like that on the street...
After all, it is so great when you have the opportunity to choose - cool clothes, manner of behavior or car.
Thank you for your help in preparing the material Kawaicat store.
Kiev tore apart the atomic union.
Kiev officially formalized the refusal of Ukraine to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnitsky NPP.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday with a second attempt still voted for the termination of the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project could not be started.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law cancelling the agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the Khmelnitsky NPP.
The draft law submitted by the government was implemented only from the second vote, for the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the required minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted for the draft.
The Khmelnytsky NPP laid down under the USSR under the original project was supposed to have four power units of 1 GW with VVER-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the blocks would have to be built on credit from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relations between the two countries, Kiev began to close relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky nuclear power plant and the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only sphere where the relations have been preserved is the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the existing Ukrainian nuclear power plants (provided about half of the electricity generation in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NPP Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
The plans to complete the Khmelnitsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, Kiev announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary-General opposes the use of military force in the settlement of the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
“There is no military solution,” the AP quoted him as saying when asked about Russia’s military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said that he will hold a meeting with foreign ministers of the countries-permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Bogdanovsky said that the General Staff does not exclude the possibility of creating a future air force base in Syria.
There are no such plans yet.
“But anything can happen,” Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, “Kommersant” reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to combat the banned terrorist group “Islamic State”.

The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian colleagues-parliaments to discuss the situation in the southeast of Ukraine.
“What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations,” Gerasimov said.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and “to return to the normal activities of our countries.”
Asked whether, in his opinion, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the Normandy format or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the former President of the country Leonid Kuchma said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not fundamentally changed their positions at the tripartite negotiations, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma in the municipal district, distributing 12 deputy mandates, played out on party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were heard from representatives of the CPRF, accusing the electorate of “covering up falsifications”.
Opposition comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the electorate refused the Communists of Russia party to organize a referendum on the abolition of the fee for the repair of apartment buildings.
The city electorate officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the voters' lists in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued for voting in the precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed among political parties, depending on the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six deputies' seats in pride rely on Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only mandate of the LDPR was given to party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
Two CPRF mandates are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Fair Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates have to decide whether they will work as deputies in the city council: in the event of a waiver of the mandate, he goes to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the Election Committee Alexander Makeev told the members of the commission that he introduces the duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" for the rejection of mandates.
When approving the protocol on the results of the elections, the representatives of the CPRF reported multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a member of the electoral commission with the right of deliberative vote from the Communist Party of Ukraine, proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormov district, the entrance to the administration building, where the four district commissions were located, was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could go inside, and a resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right of deliberative vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head stopped access only when the vote was over and the precinct commissions had not yet come to submit their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," - said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the mountains of the Electoral Committee.
The Communists objected that in the blocked administration building for more than four hours illegally detained the deputy of the assembly of the region Lyudmila Aristov, about which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition was also outraged that a number of UICs began sealing the urns at 6-7 a.m. on election day, putting ballots for early voting in them.
At the same time, the members of the commissions with the right to a deliberative vote and observers were not notified, so they came to the beginning of the elections at 8 am.
Communists believe that in the morning before the opening of polling stations, ballots could be thrown into the urns uncontrollably.
However, the election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints for various reasons, according to Alexander Makeev, did not find any violations with the throws of unaccounted ballots.
The members of the commission did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova through the lezzebirkom to come out with amendments to the regional legislation to clearly set the time of opening the envelopes with ballots of early voting, which then fall into the urn.
"On your own initiative, contact at least the CEC," Alexander Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, CPRF member Sergei Samokhin fell on the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the electorate ignored dozens of complaints and covered forgery in the elections.
"You are not here at a rally, be careful to declare!" - offended the chairman of the election committee.
In the end, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
Until September 27, the electorate must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the city Duma of Nizhny Novgorod of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused the political party "Communists of Russia" to register an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to put two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: whether they agree with the fact that the fees for the repair of apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled", and tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the lawyer of the Duma Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the “Communists of Russia” is contrary to the legislation.
FedEx’s revenue is mixed, down forecasts for 2016.
FedEx reported disappointing results in the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced its annual profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-traded trading 45 minutes before the exchange opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it plans to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts assumed $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
The forecast is falling despite an average 4.9 percent rate hike, which will come into effect on January 4, and a rise in ground handling fees for heavy or bulky goods, which begins in November.
The company said it still plans to increase revenue compared to last year due to cost cuts, increased gross revenue and growth in online trading.
Fred Smith, chairman and CEO, said the company was “working stably with weak economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade, as compared to the forecast.”
Plans to hire workers during the holidays were announced the day after a competitor, UPS, announced that they plan to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same as they hired last year.
For the quarter, which ended August 31, FedEx earned $ 692 million, 6 percent more than a year earlier.
Revenue per share was $2.42, close to the forecast of an average of $2.44 per share, conducted by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international express transportation sector, leading to a lack of growth in gross income in its express transportation division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transportation revenues increased by 29%, but operating revenues remained largely unchanged due to increased costs of large shipments and self-insurance.
The express transportation division received higher incomes due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, incomes fell due to higher labor costs.
In pre-traded trading, about an hour before the stock market opened, FedEx’s shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, falling 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
At the most anticipated meeting in a few years, Federal Reserve leaders will spend two days this week at a 27-foot Honduran redwood table, deciding whether it’s time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated two-story meeting room, a wall image of the United States will hang over them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double order from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the leaders of the Federal system have acknowledged that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third order could be an unknown factor in a near-foreseen decision to be announced on Thursday on whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even though most of the data shows robust economic growth, recent shocks in global financial markets may deter already cautious Federal system leaders from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds — even by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important thing to consider,” said Lindsay M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise the stakes, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further,” she said.
There is no consensus on what will be done in the Federal Reserve, which in itself provokes fluctuations in the financial market.
About half of economists recently surveyed by Bloomberg predicted interest rate hikes this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from doing so, with the key indicator showing only about a 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
This could lead to a fall in the stock market if the Federal system raises the rate, provided that decision makers do not soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones index rose by 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,598.85.
The take-off was triggered by expectations that the policy makers of the Federal system would leave the bet this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It will be a surprise if the Federal system raises rates at this point in time,” he said.
If the Federal Reserve does, “they will have to go a long way in approving their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so they don’t panic.”
Other experts objected that raising the rate could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal system would operate.
Just a month ago, the federal system seemed inclined to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expects a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress is needed.
Although the growth of new jobs slowed in August, labor market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and almost at what the Federal System considers full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
And while inflation continues to be below the central bank’s 2% annual target, the Federal system’s leadership said the key reason was the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy “can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China devalued its currency.
The average Dow Jones index for industrial stocks fell as much as 16% from a record high in May, as investors feared a slowdown in China's economy could hamper global growth.
The market partially regained its position this month, and the Dow Jones index is now about 10% below its high May value.
For the leadership of the Federal Reserve, market outrage further complicates the difficult calculations of the timing of the interest rate hike.
“In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have started to twist the nuts at this meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, senior researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to get more control over the consequences.
“There is a great deal of uncertainty about what the consequences might be for the U.S. economy, and they have little to no reliable data since the recent events in China,” he said.
The health of the global economy is not a major concern of the Federal system and should not be taken into account in these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve has become the world’s financial power.
The influence of the Central Bank in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could “muffle” its monetary expansion has caused shocks in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, it would be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is “art rather than science,” said Zachary Carabell, head of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that “in the history of the Federal Reserve, there have been instances of overreaction to financial market movements that seem unrelated to economic principles.”
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who insisted on raising the rate, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia has led the Federal System to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite the limited identifiable implications for growth in the United States," Lacker said.
A year later, the leaders of the Federal system canceled these cuts.
The Federal Reserve should put stability first only in times of major crises such as the 2008 market crash,” said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The last panic did not come close to this level, he said.
“You wouldn’t want to be in a situation where you’re scared of rising rates because markets are experiencing a shock,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for the World Economy.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don’t think they should be ahead of the curve.

State Duma speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the United States is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees flood into Europe.
According to Interfax, he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
“I am not a supporter of conspiracy theories, but the question arises: is it not Europe that is the ultimate goal of those who, with such maniacal perseverance, have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years?”
“Someone probably assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and disadvantaged people who are fleeing death, will rush to the prosperous countries of the EU,” he added.
Naryshkin asked: “Have many political leaders in Europe spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally sweeping their countries?”
“No, the old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent,” he said.
According to Naryshkin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
“Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially looked at how the military boots, sewn according to NATO standards, are melting moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law,” the speaker stressed.
Government troops and their loyal paramilitary formations are confronted by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the opponents of the Syrian government joined the banned terrorist group “Islamic State” in Russia.
The U.S. supports rebels who oppose both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such insurgents terrorists.
The Syrian president called the reason for the West’s hostility to Russia.
Western claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are actually that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, First Channel, "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Rossiyskaya Gazeta".
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and replace him with another, who would act in the interests of Western countries and not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp turn of Western media with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, Russian President Vladimir Putin “turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite being elected as a result of democratic elections recognized in the West.”
Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the constant statements of the West that Assad himself should leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - at the request of the people, and not by the decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva communiqué.
“If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately,” he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that cooperation with them is being carried out.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about the military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military equipment.
“Of course, there is an exchange of military specialists between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out,” he said.
As for the other States, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to combat terrorism.
“We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States,” Assad said.
The number of deaths exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group “Islamic State”, banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States strikes ISIS positions from the air.

This was reported by Reuters with reference to the representative of the State Department John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
However, Kirby did not provide further details.
At the same time, he said that the United States has the tools to “further isolate Russia” if it will support Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reported.

They also discussed ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, U.S. officials said that Russia is increasing its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow’s increased support for Assad.
Washington said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be even more isolated from the international community.

Borodai called the information of the American newspaper a defamation of Strelkov.
The former head of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of “Lenta.ru”.
The note in the Washington Post is great because it's all messed up.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, of course, was not tied up and he “went out” from the territory of the republics of Donbass in a very high mood, without ropes, without three vans of money, which are attributed to him by different characters,” he said.
According to Borodai, the talk about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper really went.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," the former head of the DPR government said.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American publication decided to write about the fact that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia “linked”.
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then these are surprisingly misunderstood words, because I stressed that Strelkov was leaving on his own,” Borodai said.
"This is a slander against me and against Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, an article appeared on the pages of The Washington Post, which cited Borodai’s words that he was taking Strelkov to the territory of Russia in a forced manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie his associate.
The Polish authorities began to search for a train with Nazi gold.
Polish loggers began cutting down trees above an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, there is a train with the gold of the Third Reich.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the veracity of rumors about the railway lineup with treasures.
Inside the train there may be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the existence of a train with gold is no more convincing than the previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to sever the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland’s deputy culture minister, Peter Zhuchowski, said local treasure hunters had found the same train with the Third Reich gold that legends have said, with a “99 percent probability.”
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm appealed to the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with the message that they found the train in a walled tunnel at a depth of 70 meters.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia’s chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco until the age of 21.
Evgeny Brun noted that before this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drug - acts especially harmful."
So he said live on the radio station "Speaks Moscow", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Council of the Federation Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
Humans mature unevenly.
You can serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for this.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally ripening only by the age of 21," Brun said.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the project "Sober Russia" Sultan Hamzayev told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to increase the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed together with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again at the site of the upper house of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be established in the Federation Council to draft a draft law under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to check compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk asked the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development", a correspondent of Sib.fm read the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015 he bought the Bible, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society, in the store "Chitay-gorod" on Red Avenue.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development."
On September 16, the statement was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor’s Office of the city of Novosibirsk.
A response to the appeal of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is quite a fundamental problem that will shake society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians of Rio Grande Promotes Healthy Eating for Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a controversial method to convince women of the need for full nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the demonstration of images of babies sucking their breasts, painted with images of harmful food.
The composition of breast milk includes various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Due to high energy needs, pregnant and pregnant women are recommended to increase the daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study suggests that one calorie increase is not the only dietary change that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy diet on the immune system of the child has been identified.
A train rammed a school bus outside Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that she could not move from the rails, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
A minute later, they had a collision in front of them.
It was filmed by one of the students.
There was panic among the students due to the emergency situation.
Some children started crying and running along the sidelines.
The route is still blocked.
According to police, no one was injured by a miracle, except for one passenger of the train, who received light injuries.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300,000 euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr..
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, held on Friday, ended with the victory of Magali knockout in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a brain injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was connected to a life support device.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He has two children left.
This is the second fatality among Australian boxers in six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Bradon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
Now AMA recommends not to engage in this sport, and it is better, from her point of view, to ban it altogether.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally,” said Stephen Parnis, vice president of the organization.
But in the form in which boxing now exists, there will always be situations when an athlete receives a hemorrhage or brain injury, which leads to either death or serious injury.
For this reason, AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that brings together practitioners and medical students.
Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called inadmissible the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We see this as unacceptable actions, as an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the participants of the OSCE PA to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morals back into politics.
Let us return dialogue and law to the practice of international communication.
Let us return the humanist ideals to the democratic world order.
“Duality never ends well,” he said.
Speaking from the podium of the Parliamentary Assembly, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on the members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also said that we should pay tribute to the OSCE.
“This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine,” the politician said.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in athletics Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey Shubenkov.
He managed to win the team championship of Europe at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently the athlete won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking the third place in the overall standings.
"New Izvestia" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the outgoing season.
Is the season not over for you?
Yes, I am going to perform at the World Military Games, which will be held in October in Korea, and then I will think about rest.
True, I will be preparing now at home, in Barnaul, and being at home is still a completely different state.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August, the beginning of September is a great time.
The passions after the main start of the season have boiled away, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
You can compete in pleasure, in "relaxation".
Plus, you know, the vacation's coming soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions ...
Tiredness at the end of the season always accumulates.
It doesn’t matter what you do, win or lose.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, relocations - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You are tired physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, my emotions are on the rise.
What's up, I'm just happy!
By the time you finish at the World Championships in Beijing, do you come back often?
Yes, it does.
And you, journalists, don't let me forget that.
But in general, I think that the bad athlete who lives old victories, scrolls his successful races again and again.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and we need to move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season very different from the usual?
I can't say it was anything special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He trained first at home in Barnaul, then at meetings, then at home again.
As usual.
But with the coach set the task: to try to reach a new level, which I have not been at yet.
Almost all winter time was spent on laying the foundation.
We ran a bunch of crosses, did exercises on general physical training, which included traction, and squat, and back we pumped.
Then they took up barrier training, they did a lot of engineering.
Have you been watching the rivals?
I always try to do it, good in the age of the Internet there is no problem with it.
I watched the winter European Championship, and there in the barrier sprint the whole pedestal was occupied by the French!
I thought again: we need to do something, to dilute this company.
With each start this season, you have added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
I’ve had all the last few seasons in roughly the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 first, and then 13.50.
I am always moving my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was focused primarily on this result.
But the paradox is that you kind of feel that you are ready for feats, and in competitions to show your readiness is not always possible.
What was it like at the Olympics in London?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final race (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - "NI") immediately.
It was really good, I could really run out of 13 seconds.
And even if he repeated his best result at the time, he would become the bronze medalist of the Games.
But it was bad luck.
Do you remember your first World Cup?
What about it?
It was in Taegu.
I really wanted to get into the finals, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell off straight from the morning, in the preliminary races.
Then I realized that tearing and tearing my head - means not to run anywhere at all.
Two years later at the World Championships in Moscow already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win "gold" already then!
How does it manage, developing a decent speed, not to lose even the head, not to turn off?
And that's the hardest part.
You need to be very careful, focused on technology, so as not to fall barriers.
I noticed that when you adjust not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the most high, when you have a feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland after the first serious successes tend to move closer to the capital.
Have there ever been such thoughts?
It's better at home anyway.
I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be good to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
How long have you and Klevtsov been together?
I've been here since I was 12 years old, since I got into athletics.
First, I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with a sprint, then jumped in length, triple.
Children's multiplayer was - it's when the ball is thrown, jumping in length from place...
At 14 I tried running with barriers, and I liked it.
From the first race, it was possible to fulfill the norm of the second adult category.
That's what I did.
Have you ever feared barriers?
I was able to negotiate with them right away.
But there was always a lot of work to be done on the technique.
There's so much pain over there!
There is no way out of this routine.
The technique needs to be sharpened constantly - so that at night I could be woken up, I immediately got up and ran through the barriers.
Everyone who has seen your race in Beijing claims that it was a very beautiful run.
Oh, thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't revise my races, and I couldn't stand it here.
But we need to work on efficiency – there are no limits to perfection.
Are you afraid that a victory a year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
If you choose this path, you have to go to the end.
My coach likes to repeat: if you are not weak, you should not feel any extra load.
And I totally agree with him on that.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I am not naive enough to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, do not feed them with bread - give, throw the enemy.
And although I did not wrap my flag, and the same thing, exactly the same thing, a million times said here, and did not directly call anyone a bastard, - I was struck by another.
All my pseudo-friends blinked, evaporated in a second.
The press that I'm exposed to is so strong that even I, who've seen the types of boys, think people are bleached.
It's like you're walking, walking, and you're being attacked by a crowd, and you're being mutated with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, I'm afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
And only idiots can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
I'd rather be the best journalist in my job.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili sharply described the Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something in no way fits into the general picture of the human community.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with the call of some bastard from the Kremlin.
I have an idea who it might have been...
Cobson doesn't have much left to live on.
I don’t understand, he’s the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin’s hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished his monument.
Of course, people remember him as an insult to his small homeland.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seven leads in the ranking despite attempts of the Ninth to highlight the loss of the leaders in Today Show
Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson’s trip to Canberra to cover the consequences of the Liberal Party’s announcement to vacate the leader’s seat failed to significantly raise Today’s rating.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the capital of the state after the defeat of Malcolm Turnbull by Tony Abbott.
The rival, Sunrise, starring David Koch and Samantha Armitage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance torture does not seem to have had much significance for Australian viewers, with Sunrise’s audience having 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today’s audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly more compared to its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has narrowed the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000 compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers versus 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happened all morning.
The winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thanks for clarifying!

Important news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former series star Packed to the Rafters Eric Thomson.
A new drama about a recently widowed family father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has attracted an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics speculated on whether Thomson could handle the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night was a loud yes.
The X Factor Seven remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million viewers, easily bypassing The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
For the Seventh mixed luck and failure on the second night of Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new TV quiz, led by Andrew O'Keeffe, gathered 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the hour (from 17:30 to 18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire (613,000).
On Monday evening, Chase Australia's first half-hour attracted 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour garnered a staggering 720,000.
Hot Seat has amassed 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s ratings on the second night will force Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the MacGwyr show.

The three finalists agree that “Boyfriend” Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
Is the Secret Revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay, and Snejana Marcoski may have accidentally made it clear which of them would win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will eventually stay in The Boyfriend is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who reached the final, of course, keep silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snowflake Marcoskey and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day that two of the three girls had to be left, they may have accidentally given a hint about the winner.
Sam Wood will remain silent until the final on Thursday.
All three women come in a lyrical mood, telling why Wood is the perfect man, while mentioning his sense of humor, purposefulness, family values, cheerfulness as the reasons why each of them would be happy to become his companion.
However, with their answers to the question "If not you, then who should get the last rose of Wood?" they could inadvertently tell which of them actually won the heart of "The Boy".
Jevons-Fellows and Marcoski no doubt called McKay the perfect couple for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
“From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy (of Sarah) and the energy of Sam and realized that they were very suitable for each other, and throughout the show I had no doubts about that,” Jevons-Fallows said in a statement.
“Sarah is a very open person, she is easy and fun,” Marcoski added.
I saw them together, there was a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that thanks to home dates last week, she realized that Wood may be “the same person.”
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I realized that this was definitely not just a game - I believed him with all my heart," she said.
When asked who Voodoo should choose, if it is not her, she answered mysteriously.
“I don’t know if I can talk about it,” she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Channel Ten on Wednesdays at 7.30 p.m.

Jarrid Hayne had several options for starting his career in the NFL.
Detroit and Seattle became very interested in him after his move to the U.S. — as did many other clubs who sent inquiries after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsoul, and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayn on the bench for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball, which the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the first return of the pant in the winning game against Minnesota with a score of 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayn another opportunity to regain the hinge, and also involved him in the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed himself on the good side and after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of making a difference to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special team coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarrid Hayne lost the ball on the return of the pant by the Minnesota Vikings team during the first quarter
For such a start debut in the NHL Hayne and his numerous Australian fans clearly did not expect.
It was seen that Hayne was fighting as he left the field after losing the ball, and later he told host Hamish and Andy on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not have imagined a more unsuccessful start for a career in the NFL.
“It happens, you just think about the next game and that’s it,” said Hayne.
Hayne compared his blunder to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when throwing a ball in his scoring zone brought an attempt to Queensland.
In the end, this experience turned out to be very useful for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne took a picture with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the picture on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under the threat of using weapons at the Siberian airport.
Openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
On the border of Hungary there were clashes of migrants with the police.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian settlement of Reske, which turned into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, the Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at police officers and try to tear down the fence installed at the border.
The scene of the clashes is reinforced, the police take action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border by buses in the direction of Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reported.
The authorities of the country allowed migrants to arrive on Croatian territory and ensure their transportation from there to the desired country.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian Parliament tightened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of state borders, criminal prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, as well as an accelerated procedure for the consideration of asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, for which he will be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary within one year.
The Hungarian parliament also intends to consider the transfer to the armed forces of Hungary of the functions of border control of the country’s parliament in the near future.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began construction of a 175km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to contain the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
The Russian admitted to committing the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States.
Accused of the largest cyber attack in US history, Russian Vladimir Drinkman has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, according to Reuters.
During the trial in the federal court of New Jersey, Drinkman confessed to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about the conspiracy with three citizens of Russia and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The total damage from the actions of the accused was estimated at $ 300 million.
“Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security,” US Attorney Paul Fishman said in a statement.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When passing the sentence, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, perhaps, reduce his term.
Drinkman's verdict will be announced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies his guilt in the crimes he is accused of.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk with Russia’s support of the Assad regime.
During a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia’s support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad exacerbates the conflict in the country.
“Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia’s support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our common goal of fighting extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power,” the statement said.
Kerry reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to fight the Islamic State group (which is banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad “will never be a reliable member” of the coalition.
Also during the phone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only by a political transition from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest has threatened to isolate Russia if it does not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest offered to join an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media often report the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and help Syrians master the technique to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police opened fire with rubber bullets on protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police began shooting rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupandai district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country’s capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, head of the district police, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered at one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakal reported that the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why the rubber bullets known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused such high mortality.
The clash was the latest in weeks of fierce protests in southern, flat Nepal, where representatives of the Madezi ethnic group say the new provinces formed under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in western Nepal, among Taru nationals who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10 a.m.
August, when four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following a devastating earthquake that claimed the lives of thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers voted for articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a company for 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of the chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
About the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects, he told the correspondent of "Regional".
Oleg Valeryevich, where did you start as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of local budget funds.
Subsequently, municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document turnover to five days.
Previously, papers on the instances could walk for months.
Measures were developed to increase the income base and optimize costs.
In November last year, a visiting meeting of the government was held in Sayansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
The city did not have design and estimate documentation (PSD) for any object.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the preparation of PSD for roads, kindergarten, northern sewage collector and plumbing.
Road works are already underway in two areas.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such a positive demographic has not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of providing places in kindergartens today is one of the most urgent.
Since September 1, the kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 seats, has been closed for overhaul.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds.
Last year, after the renovation, kindergarten No. 23 was opened, which is now visited by 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were found for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the People's Initiatives program helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of one and a half and three years.
There are no queues for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the area?
We have a clear understanding that the construction in the city should be carried out, first of all, by the Sayan enterprises, it is they who need to be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is being commissioned.
As for the construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangarya, which was included in the program for the construction of economy class housing.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
In total, we announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing Those wishing to participate in the program very much.
One of the conditions - housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes turnkey finishing.
If we can do that, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan Pork Complex was built on the territory, which in 2004 was sold for nothing.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to challenge this deal.
Especially since the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares of land to the regional property is being resolved, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Has the Institute of Social Partnership been developed in Sayansk?
We have signed about 140 agreements of socio-economic partnership.
Many projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as Vostok-Center CJSC, Novo-Ziminsk CHP, Sayansky Broiler LLC, PK MDF LLC, the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Directly to the Day of the city, LLC "Sayan broiler" gave the city a children's town, the company "Vostok-Center" carried out the repair of the horse patio, where specialists are engaged with children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped to colorfully celebrate the Day of the city.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious labor contribution to the development of Sayansk were presented with anniversary medals.
Patrons also participate in the work of the city charitable foundation.
The very first step was to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
For nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles are directed to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, to support children from low-income families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for specialists is of great importance to address the personnel issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, service housing received four teachers.
We are working on a housing allocation program with the possibility to privatize it in five years.
The plan is to redesign the building, which will be built eight more apartments for teachers.
Also teachers and doctors participate in the program "Housing for the Russian family".
In the future - the construction of a house for employees of the budget sphere.
The most important thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of social benefits, taking into account the increase in prices.
The State Duma introduced a bill providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the increase in prices.
The author of the document, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev, MP from "Fair Russia", also proposes to conduct an additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
Indexation of social pensions, according to the current legislation, is carried out annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the living wage of a pensioner in the Russian Federation for the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of the indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs Federica Mogherini, the OSCE PA Speaker Ilkka Kanerva said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly are inadmissible.
This was reported to journalists by a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar Nikolai Kovalev.
In support of Kanerva’s position, the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus and Greece, were collected.
"There has already been a fairly strong support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA had been speaking with the intention to collect the signatures of deputies, which pointed to the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise this problem to the level of the European Union’s governing structures and “send a petition”.
The NHC reports that the probability of a cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands is 60 percent
The wide front of the low-pressure region about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Green Cape Islands has a 60 percent chance of turning into a tropical cyclone over the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure region roughly in the middle between the Green Cape Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, according to forecasters from Miami.
Google Launches Doubling Donations Campaign to Raise $11 Million for Refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has launched a doubling campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help European-captured refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has taken an uncharacteristic personal approach by announcing a donation campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Massoud, who fled with her family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
“We got on dubious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has intensified, many people like my family desperately need help.
The donations will be donated to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount on google.com/refugeelief reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, caused largely by a four-year civil war in Syria that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Low-obesity diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
The beneficial effect after obesity surgery in people with low-obesity type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still too early to say that diabetics with low obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
“Death rates don’t show up right away,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert on obesity surgery, who wrote about the new study in a column by JAMA Surgery editor.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses various techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes over several years, but the main studies have been conducted among people with morbid obesity who have a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at a value from 18.5 to 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass surgery and sleeve-type gastrectomy - with medical treatment for type 2 diabetes in people with low obesity.
The mean BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of their fifth year of study.
At the same time, BMI in those who received non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains at about 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and partially - 28%.
In the group that received medication, for comparison, a complete cure for diabetes was observed in only 1%, and a partial cure was observed in only about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors said.
The researchers also controlled blood hemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels in dynamics.
Hemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But the best glycemic control measures, reflected by good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality rates over five years, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of two types of surgical treatment.
In the fifth year, compared to the group that had a sleeve gastroctomy, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs 14.2 kg), achieved a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs 2.1%), and was also closer to complete remission of diabetes (46.9% vs 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the College of Medicine in Phoenix, University of Arizona.
According to a Swedish study for obese people who chose bariatric intervention, the likelihood of dying within 15 years was about 29% lower compared to the group that used more traditional methods.
Despite the fact that the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that this encourages people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here because it states that such surgery is safe in a low BMI group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease,” she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient’s BMI falls in the range of between 27 to 30.
“I think we’ve been waiting too long to get people to take it seriously,” she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytishche robbers took out of the house fur coats and 9 million rubles.
In Mytishchi, robbers attacked the residents of the Moscow suburban house and stole from them 9 million rubles and three women's fur coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident occurred on Tuesday morning.
Two strangers entered the house, located on Gorky Street, tied the 20-year-old son of the housekeeper and, threatening with both knives, stole 9 million rubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Theft".
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to host tourists who will come to see the World Cup in 2018.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very alarming sign.
On the eve of the World Cup, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to resettle all the guests of the city.
The interlocutors of Rosbalt believe that due to the tournament, the cost of renting rented apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship for rented housing will have to overpay.
The World Cup forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law, written specifically for the championship, each hotel in St. Petersburg must go through the classification procedure and prove that it corresponds to the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even send documents for requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of the UFAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to start 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antimonopolists.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov said.
The problem is that now on the account of literally every number, none can not be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship fans will occupy all the hotels in St. Petersburg.
Now in the city tourists can count on 30,500 rooms.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, 550 one-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, Nana Guichia, only 23 hotels have passed the classification at the moment - so many inspections were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, Smolny by a surprising coincidence of circumstances is unknown.
That is, there may be more of those who have passed the classification, but no one knows about it.
“The last six months, the hotels have not been very eager to pass the classification,” admitted the director of the North-Western branch of the Russian Union of tourism industry Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, in which there were no costs for inspections, while the procedure can cost the hotel depending on the status from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more.
However, recently hotel managers have intensified and began to apply for classification, assured Shadskaya.
Hotels need to have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay a fine, but also will not get the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the star rating, a fixed fee will be developed for the hotel room at the time of the tournament.
The formulas for which the cost will be calculated will be published next year.
This is done in order to prevent the price rise by 200-300%, as it happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You need to have a conscience and not allow a raise of two or three times, but hotels need to be allowed to earn.
"I think the growth will be up to 50%," - said the President of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of the market economy.
I do not know how much this fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
“It’s better than unstoppable travel,” he said.
It is not clear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that hostels should be preserved," Nana Gwachia said.
However, according to her, the owners of mini-hotels in any case should be ready to tighten the Housing Code.
If the state Duma still approves the bill, then in St. Petersburg will close about 80% of hostels, and at the moment they have 1.5 thousand rooms.
According to the President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers of the North-West Leonid Garbar, St. Petersburg lacks two- and three-star hotels, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards hotels with four and five stars.
This situation is similar to the situation when "75 thousand VIPs sit in the 80,000-th stadium".
This can be corrected at the expense of mini-hotels.
Their possible ban, the expert considers “idiotism”: “It seems strange to me that only people can live in apartments, but visitors for some reason can not.”
If the hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that this is wrong.
But if it’s like a hotel that guests come to for a short period of time, why not?
Mini-hotels are at risk of missing the World Cup and because of their impermanence.
Hundreds of small hotels simply do not have time to pass the classification, and the pit digs themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will order work.
"Companies that can carry out this procedure is not so much, so they will refuse less paid orders from the mini-hotel, and will choose those that travel," - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators passed inspections at the moment are much higher than St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is due, among other things, to the constant changes in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, you will most likely have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
According to the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the city can mobilize the river fleet, that is, the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will be prepared to come in vans, in which you can spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that they will be empty," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Also very popular during the football championship will enjoy rented housing.
Most likely, a reserve of rented apartments will be created in the city.
The rent will increase by 10-30%.
"Obviously, housing near the stadium will be the first to leave," said Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Real Estate Development and Research Agency.
And the rental price may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in sleeping areas.
This will contribute to the construction of new transport junctions on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
Do not forget about the human qualities of citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city in which people not only suggest the road, but can also conduct a mini-tour.
There are also complications.
In 1970, my father met a family from Murmansk in the yard - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to spend the night: it was difficult to sleep with hotels at that time, it was difficult to sleep at the station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the inhabitants of the city - to call home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But maybe in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments will have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
I watched with admiration today Zhirinovsky’s clowning in the State Duma.
He did things like this when our generation was still learning how to trade newspapers, and he is still in great shape.
The topic of the speech, as it were, is “LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region”.
The protocols do not shake - for there is nothing; other protocols, other than those signed by the election commissions, the LDPR, apparently, does not.
Here he picks up Ivan Abramov, who took second place, and shouts something like, "Here's the winner of the election!"
And immediately he throws himself at Rodnina, and then, after a fight with the chairman, takes the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with the fronts of your crooks and thieves."
The press, of course, emphasizes not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a result of this scandal and insult.
Actually, Wolfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region together with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky stunt in the style of "Slippery!", and not a protest of a political party against the results of specific elections.
And the faction formally scandalized, and the elections, if you believe the party’s website and Facebook Ivan Abramov, are not recognized, but the leader obviously gets off the topic.
Allows the dead on the Amur to bury their own dead, and he himself preaches against the "United Russia" in general and owes nothing to the relative.
An elegant solution, so as not to lose a face, and in a real, and not showy scandal not to go.
Another thing is that now Abramov himself is in a strange position.
Except for the cries from the authorities, he did not wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
He - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other - for the narrow circle, it became a formal occasion for insulting the respected champion, and, even cooler, Ham attacks on the EP and ONF.
And then, of course, he has to seriously think about what to do.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the politician number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 to the only regional single-mandate district, it can turn into a pariah, which successfully used its own party leadership and a super-stimulus for the same ONF and party leadership of another.
Certainly, there would not have been Zhirinovsky, he should have been invented and respected to observe him.
Trump is still growing and growing.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plein air.
The bathroom fell out of nowhere.
Only Abramov buried the subject under himself.
It's beautiful, really.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhists called for an end to violence in countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama’s Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics research, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity should be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama spoke highly of the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
“Caring for thousands of refugees is fine, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries,” he said.
After all, we need to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
Speaking about the violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George W. Bush after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the U.S.’s harsh reaction launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that a solution to this problem was possible through non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in the number of children who have ingested hand sanitizer over the past 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who ingested a hand sanitizer high in alcohol, according to the Georgia Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxicology Center, the incidence of ingestion by children under 12 years of hand disinfection fluids reported in toxicology centers increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children come in contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately, some percent of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant fluid specifically, and some do so to impress their friends, or to argue for social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as a cheap drink.
The teenagers reportedly mixed the disinfectant liquid with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to pleasant smells of disinfectant fluid.
“The child doesn’t think it could hurt him,” Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (disinfecting hand fluids) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very attractive for children.
Hand sanitizer contains about 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, in particular, only a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s a high-concentration alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief physician at the Toxicology Center at the University of Kansas Hospital.
You wouldn’t just leave a glass of whiskey behind, but people keep these hand sanitizers in sight, and if kids get to them, it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naidja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested a strawberry-flavoured hand sanitizer at school in the amount of about four sprays, was sent to an ambulance for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is legally considered to be intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an ambulance doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naidja was confused and could not walk when she was taken to the ambulance.
Doctors watched her through the night in a separate children's clinic to avoid missing any signs of brain injury because of alcohol, the girl fell and hit her head, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," Scott's mother, Naiji, told CNN.
This could have been fatal to my child.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant napkins, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfecting fluids are associated with deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in northern New York conspired to poison their “opposing” teacher by “spreading antibacterial substances in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher has a strong allergy to hand disinfectants, and she forbade keeping them in her class.
The police believe that the failed plan was “empty talk” and addresses discipline issues to the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya sad cast-iron owl.
Kids who come for books try to feed her candy.
It has been in the library for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twenties of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged plays on Mayakovsky’s poems, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin’s wife.
The correspondence lasted for four years, and, as the newspaper "Young Stalin" wrote in 1939, "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became stronger every day.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent one day to distant Barnaul friends her children's photo.
And when the Barnauls asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna would object to the library being given her name, she wrote that she did not.
The letters have long been dusting in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose harsh profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
In the years of perestroika, different people often called, resented: why the children's library is not renamed?
Let there be a library of the name of some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The staff of the library sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it is.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and favorite library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby - a path of yellow brick.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of the artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olya was a manager at a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all other managers was distinguished only by her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "I need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called “My Cancer Mommy” – “My Mommy Has Cancer”.
Olya made illustrations, and thought: life can end at any moment, and there will be no miracles in it if you do not create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, illustrates children's books of writers around the world and writes fairy tales herself.
It is traditionally believed that children lose interest in the book, that they are increasingly living in some kind of virtual space.
But to us come reading children, and their parents understand the importance of reading, - says the "Russian planet" director of the library Tatiana Kushvid.
In recent years, we even had such a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and it will live - the kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
In the lobby of the library hangs a large exhibition stained glass with an updated photo exposition.
Once a quarter, new photos of readers who go to the library with the whole family are posted: mom, dad and children.
The library is happy that more and more fathers began to come with the children.
If at two years old the child read all Chukovsky, then at an older age he needs books more difficult.
But now there is a law under which an eight-year-old prodigy is forbidden to issue books from the 12+ category.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then come back again, and gradually "Krupskaya" becomes for them something like a family club.
In the library there are treasures - a pre-revolutionary collection of bilen with captives and eras, Korolenko's story in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the lining of "Murzilki" for 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "Temple of the Book", we are now open to the movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school," explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, draw together.
We made a play area for kids - the child just comes to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are carried away by their parents, and they are resting with their feet, they do not want to leave.
Often moms come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place among all the other places where you need to come with children.
Tatyana Kushvid says: “Modern children just like we used to love classical children’s literature:
“The publishing business is now evolving, and a lot of attention is being paid to authors who are the link between generations.”
And if we talk about small children, it is important for them that there is some hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library constantly publishes booklets for parents, in which it tells what is happening in modern children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to and why.
Booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is still not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to take books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege has only children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase in the basement, in the bookstore.
The steps will creak under your feet - it's already a very old time machine.
With the book of your childhood you meet as with an old comrade: hello, it is good that you and I do not change.
Ellie still walks cheerfully on the road paved with yellow brick, lazy Tolya Ryzhykov steals magic matches, and Boy-Kibalchish never said to the cursed bourgeois of the War Secret - he has such a strong word.
Such books are like passwords, by them you can recognize your own anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the vault – for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of bylines with captives and eras.
Or to tell Korolenko in the famous appendix to the magazine "Niva".
Or a patch of "Murzilik" for 1936.
Time has aged the pages, painted them in tea color.
These books are no longer available to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, I dream everything - I will retire and take care of rare children's books.
But the children will not, so to speak, be inclined to do so: and the paints in the old books are not very bright, and the topics ... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, the party, the Komsomol.
Now it seems, why did we all write this “Pioneer Truth?”
But it was still interesting, - Galina Ilyasova, the head of the bookstore, tells the "Russian planet".
The pages of "Dirty" have darkened from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna runs the bookstore all her life.
She knows the color of the hats of Buratino, in which school year Harry Potter became the captain of the Gryffindor team at the Quidditch Championship, in which situations Carlson uses a silencer for the motorbike, and who Alice Selezneva's father works.
The work of a librarian is paid little, and all who can live without these books very quickly find a different profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional feature of a children's librarian.
If he smiles at you in the first minute of the conversation, he’s a professional.
I like children’s books in general: as a librarian I like them to be, to stand smoothly and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilievna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fantasy.
I read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think things were different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and exciting of all that happened to me back then.
And because I loved them so much, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be there, despite the riders.
And I am glad when our former readers bring children, and even grandchildren...
Rumor mill: There are no differences in the "Seltice"
Griffiths refuted the Celtic controversy after Dale admitted that the Hoops were in a bad position, but he would fix it.
Harts will protest the Scottish Football Association’s claim to Nailson, and Warberton fears signing contracts in January that could disrupt the team’s unity
"Dons" increased the advantage over "Celtic" to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a small advantage over Hamilton in Pittodra, which allowed Dons to break away from Celtic by five points.
Griffiths refuted the talk of disagreements
This sparked rumors of disagreements at Celtic, which were thwarted by Griffiths, who said he and his teammates were not suffering from any heightened criticism as they prepared to meet with the leaders of the Dutch League.
“I don’t think we’re feeling the tension, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the fight for the title - de Boer
Former midfielder Ronald de Boer and former Dutch national team member Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans had lost interest in Celtic because he was not competing for the title with the Rangers.
De Boer, now an Ajax representative, said: "The most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown in Holland, and why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here aren't just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the Old Firm.
They’re talking about both teams together, and that’s what they’re interested in.
There's a lot of tension in Old Firm games, and it's not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronnie Dale admits Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
The loss to Malmö and, as a result, the withdrawal from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 players of Aberdeen, which now, having split by five points, occupies the top of the table.
However, Dale said, “Selitek has had bad periods before and we’ll be out again.”
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that this is very annoying, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is going on.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players so much better.
Staying together is so important now.
Warberton looks forward to January transfers
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting that he has identified some of the goals of the January transfers, Ranger boss Mark Warberton is distrustful of the January campaign, arguing that he does not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former Brentford striker said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team works really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who is interested in Celtic, hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer window, hinted that he could leave football after his contract with the Swans expired.
The 29-year-old suffered from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Harts are going to confront the SFA over the statements of Neilson
The Harts led 2–1 when Paterson was removed and began to lose 3–2, but the defender's red card was later cancelled; this is Collum's third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilson does not retract his words, claiming, "I did not question ethics, I did not comment on the game."
Griffiths vowed to avoid Tyncasle
The stubborn Highbernian player was reprimanded after admitting he was singing a song with offensive words about former Harts player Rudy Scazel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburne area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby on Tyncasle in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was hot,” the striker said, adding, “I can say with certainty that I wasn’t going to go back to Tyncasle if he wasn’t playing for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadis Council is confident in the management of Dundee United
Simon Donnelly argues that Dundee United’s board of directors remains confident that the management team will change things for the better, but agrees that the deteriorating situation on the pitch should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We will prepare the guys to come out again,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy that he won “unprecedentedly” at Hamilton.
Derek McInness admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assis to achieve a seventh straight league win, placing them five points above Celtic, at the top of the standings, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: “There is no team here that has won anything – a cup or a league championship – that hasn’t won meetings in this way.”
The unemployment rate among Scots is not changing, while in the United Kingdom as a whole it is growing
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9%, was above the UK level of 5.5%, according to figures from the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with 2,612,000 now employed.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the average of 73.5% for the United Kingdom.
Scottish Minister David Mandell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy.”
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen a further improvement in the labour market in Scotland, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I'm a witness to the Oklahoma execution
Today, evading legal intervention at a later stage, I will watch as a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the death-camera viewing gallery at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
This request was first made in January through a close friend of his, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As this day drew near, I began to fear.
So why would you do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more willing than places, the results of the gloomy lottery decide who will be chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I’ll be sitting with Richard Glossip’s closest friends, and we’ve had our own relationship after months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
It's a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she herself "could have articulated better," but still believes that I am wrong in what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn’t tell me what to write, and I wouldn’t, even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help the movement to abolish the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I recorded.
I will not go into details here again.
I can't say with certainty that Richard Glossip isn't guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of abetting the crime.
But I believe there's a good chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was not enough.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that point of view, I'm gonna watch him die.
I cannot say that I will be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to for this.
From me you will learn what it feels like to watch a person I like die unnecessarily.
Police Persecuted Man Convinced to Climb Out of Canning River
A constable from the town of Canning Vale managed to persuade a man to get out of the Canning River, and himself to remain dry.
A resident of Perth intended to leave the police, but failed, stuck in dirty water in shallow water a few meters from a police officer trying to "softly persuade him to go to shore."
Canning-Vale police were called on Tuesday for illegal entry into someone else's territory in Buckingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
“He was standing in the water and saying, ‘I’m not coming out, come on, grab me,’” said Sgt. Sgt. Sandell Castledine.
Constable Laklan Perhavets did not really want to wet the uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiations with a good policeman."
“Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape,” says Senior Sergeant Castledyne.
That’s what champion Ben Cazins remembered.
In 2006, Cassins moved into a barrel to avoid a meeting with a police patrol to check for alcohol, and attempted to cross Swann.
His efforts turned out to be in vain, but prompted locals to invent the humorous "biathlon of Ben Cassins".
Peter Moody accuses stewards of espionage and threatens to withdraw from equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to infiltrate a spy in his stable last year and threatened to leave the equestrian sport immediately.
He was targeted by stewards and employees of the ethics department of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of organizing a campaign personally against him, and the withdrawal of Lady Tatai due to violation of the rules of use of drugs on the day of the start, on Wednesday, became the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always made every effort to participate in the races, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of Lidari's cobalt test, which he could not explain.
He kept his mouth shut about suspicions of espionage for a year and a half and didn’t want it to “look like a green grape.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about it, and I’ve been patient for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of line that you can’t hold back,” Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to go through the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know that I am doing everything I can for them.
When they start to think that’s not the case, then I’m going to have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally stated during an interview on racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy on his stable.
“A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I would name, if asked, and offered him a job in my stable to pass on information about what I was doing in my stable,” Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should all certainly file applications, as they failed to catch me.
Robert Rolston, the former chairman of RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the outgoing executive director of RVL, knew this all along and know it now.
Shouldn’t that make me think it’s personal?
Shouldn’t RVL have the courage to hold other people accountable for what’s going on in the business besides coaches?
Am I bad for this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe the people there think it is.
Maybe they need to take my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I'm saying may make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that saddens me.
I'm really sad about this.
I will put pressure on them and hold them accountable for their decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The coach's annoyance only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last withdrawal of the horse from the start made him declare that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for preparing the invincible champion Black Caviar, called the requirements for the use of drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's legs, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules of the race.
“I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees mistakenly compressed her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, like she did.
She was with him the day of the race.
Moody can be disqualified for three months under the rules on the use of drugs on the day of the competition for the use of a compress, which the stewards opened an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all know we need rules, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
Driver who crashed and fled the scene in Cobram arrested
Police arrested the man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalia surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with abandoning the scene, failing to provide assistance and violating other traffic rules.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in stable condition in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy parses accusations of hard power techniques
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's intercepting the ball as an "imposition of the agenda" by the two NRL championship favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during Storm's surprise win in the final of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear hint at Storm after his team won the final of a qualifying tournament at the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night when he called the game "typical" of the rugby league and stated that two of the Queensland team were not "too much in the hand."
Bellamy defended the interception of the ball by his team and stated that they were simply focused on “contact” by intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was confident of criticism of his team from the two top coaches, as it means they are worried about a possible defeat from Storm.
“It keeps popping up – I didn’t hear Trent Robinson talk about the hard times when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we have not changed anything for a whole year in our systems or defense techniques, just over the past six weeks we have paid special attention to contacts when intercepting the ball, and this was a turning point for us.
“Trent has been there for three years and he’s obviously coaching a great team, so he’s probably not used to losing and it’s been a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how it always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavarra Dragons" Bennett won the championship in 2010, showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
“He decided to compare his Saturday night game to ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was criticized a lot, calling it a boring team, and Wayne said he didn’t care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It’s the kind of football you’d want to play when you have players like that.
He made this remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play football in his style – not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they’re a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that "Storm" and "Rusters" were a competition with more points than "Broncos" and "Cowboys".
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is this an impressive football?
Or consider impressive breaks and unsuccessful attempts?
This is routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can meet them there.
Storm has a weekend off at the end of this week, as they won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronall Sharks next Saturday night at the preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will go on sale next Tuesday morning.
Accused of drug possession Serb released on bail of 200,000 dollars
The man, who faces life imprisonment for trying to appropriate 40 kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland, was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovi<0xC4><0x87>, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on a Solay yacht that sailed from South America via Vanuatu and moored in Kumera in August.
During the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the marina, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kg of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Despite the fact that Maksimovich faces a life sentence for trying to appropriate drugs in an amount sufficient for sale, Maksimovich’s lawyer argues that there is no evidence that the latter tried to get the entire batch, and that the man could be in a cafe without any intention.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan doubted that Maximovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has links to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich’s mother and stepfather were asked to make a joint pledge of $200,000 for his release.
“It is clear from the testimony of both parties that the amount of the $200,000 pledge is too much of a financial burden for them,” said Judge Flanagan.
But the measure alone is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovi<0xC4><0x87> was allowed to be released on bail on the condition that he surrenders both his Australian and Serbian passports, will be marked by the police on a daily basis and will observe the curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: “I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought to the last seconds.”
The head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match of 1/4 of the final of Eurobasket 2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the game was decided by some mistakes.
It was a big game,” Katsikaris quoted AFP as saying.
We were preparing for a great game in the performance of the Spaniards.
They tried to work in defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "At CSKA, I will be assigned the functions of Kaunas."
CSKA newcomer Joel Freeland said that he does not believe in the curse of the army.
He also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, - quotes "R-Sport" Freeland. - In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sasha Kaun, who left the team, both in the defensive construction and in the attack from the three-second zone, and I think with this.
Yes, it will take me some time to adjust to the position of the center, after all, in the NBA I played more forward.
Now it will be more necessary to confront the big center rival, but I have done this before, so I think, and now I will cope.
The last time they won the Euroleague was in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but there they could not show their best basketball every time.
It is believed that the team has been sacked.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
“Of course, it’s difficult, I understand all the disappointment of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we show the best we can, then we have a good chance to win the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the evil eye, I am not a superstitious person and I do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, then anything is possible.
I don’t have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match with Roma will be special."
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique did not hide that he returned to Rome for the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face match of his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique trained the "wolves" in the season-2011/12, but failed to prove himself from the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - quotes the official website of UEFA words of Luis Enrique. -
I have very warm memories of Rome.
It’s going to be a special game for me, but it’s not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the next match.
I expect from Roma the game she showed in Serie A against Juventus.
This is a strong team that knows how to press and knows what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: “Krasnodar” has different options for attacking actions.
Acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the Premier League with "Krasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the opponent's team.

The match will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see, - quotes the official website of the "Ural" the words of Skripchenko.
We have a week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different variants of attacking actions, carries out their attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time we are a team that is not slow, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Rocher Ca<0xC3><0xB1>as: “Astana’s house can take away anyone’s glasses”

Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Kanyas. - We did not have enough courage in the attack.
“Benfica are above class, but in the home game, I think we can count on them to take away their points.
It's quite real.
But first we need to think about Galatasaray and then Atletico.
In home games, we can take away points from anyone.
Rafael Ben<0xC3><0xAD>tez: "I will repeat it as many times as I like: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Head coach of Real Madrid Rafael Benitez expressed satisfaction with a major victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to the forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy, because Shakhtar knows how to own the ball, - quotes the official website of UEFA words Benitez.
The opponent did not have many moments, but their counterattacks are always in danger.
I won’t say that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of opportunities.
I am pleased that we did not miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it as many times as I like.
Jordi Alba: “Cristiano Ronaldo can’t be compared to Messi”
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that with his teammate Lionel Messi no one will be able to compare.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo can not do this either.
Messi is five goals taller than the rest, - quotes Le Figaro Alba. - What Leo is able to do, no one can do.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, everything changes, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group tournament match with Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and insurance in the game with such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21.45 Moscow time.
We will remind, "SE" will carry out its text transmission.
“Barcelona are a special rival, a good team with great players,” De Rossi said.
It is difficult to play with blue grenades, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To keep them, we'll have to plow through the game and keep each other safe.
Messi is almost always successful when it comes to wrapping, so we need to keep it compact and organized.

I hope that I will come out in the next match in the starting line-up, - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Yezhov.
I am not an expert on goalkeepers, I am a goalkeeper myself, we do not show repeats of missed goals, so it is difficult to track.
“Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I’d rather miss more, but the team won.

Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to force pedophiles to send photos
The pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to search for images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was sleeping, registered with an online messaging service, where he received a number of obscene images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found the missing phone and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it and found shocking photos, then immediately drew the attention of her mother.
The police arrived and saw five images, then examined the computers found at this address, and found "appropriate" search queries using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done so because it could “attract pedophiles” and then he would “pretend to be a policeman to scare them.”
Attorney General Eilid Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was a bias, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted to making requests on the computer, but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman to scare pedophiles.
He was interviewed about a conversation with an unknown person who sent him the images, and that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had a problem with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the photos on her phone, she called her mother, trembling and crying.
She saw obscene images on the phone, and then a full-time bet was made with the defendant.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the defendant used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dundee, pleaded guilty to making indecent photographs of children on June 14, last year, violating bail terms on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
Defendant’s lawyer, Gregor Sim, has filed a motion not to include Hogg in the list of perpetrators of sexual offences, as it can be proven that there was no “significant sexual element” in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed his sentence until October, until he receives a certificate from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but he was taken into custody before hearings on the remaining cases began.
It was included in the list of persons who had committed sexual offences before the date of sentencing.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe Reads the Wrong Speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell off the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but the video with the scene of the fall immediately spread on social networks.
The opening of parliament was also overshadowed by statements by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against blaming Mugabe during the address.
A month ago, they rattled the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this is exactly what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a member of parliament for the Movement for Democratic Change, said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe’s speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is titled 'Death,'" he told reporters at the end of Mugabe's speech.
It warned the noted members of parliament that immunity ends in the parliament building, and once they leave, parliamentary immunity does not work.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was “concerned” by threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and service cost reduction program.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the production of computers and printers from the more rapidly developing hardware and service sectors.
Deductions as a result of the expected job cuts will amount to approximately $2.7 billion, starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
“This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, which will lead the organization after the split.
“The Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new business style,” Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and “will focus on providing previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions” to companies, the company said in a statement.
The company was formed in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their Palo Alto garage was nicknamed the “birthplace of Silicon Valley.”
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a large-scale reorganization with the aim of moving from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest personal computer manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest development in the sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies are doing better.
Arsenal captain Michel Arteta says his teammates should support injured Jack Wilshere before playing with Dinamo Zagreb
In a conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided Wilshere's recovery went as planned, nothing would prevent him from returning to the game by Christmas.
With the most favorable development of events, Wilshire will definitely miss at least four next games in England and, given what happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most embarrassing thing about this recent issue is that Wilshire confidently ended the previous season with a single ankle injury and was going to return to the usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury does not threaten his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with the ankles or the injuries he’s had before.
These may be related things from a medical point of view, but as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injuries for any player returning to the game in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshere has recorded 23 different injuries that have occurred to him in the six years since his debut.
He has also played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the past five seasons.
If you look at the schedule for Arsenal more broadly, you can see that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two clubs in the Premier League, which accounted for the most missed due to injuries of the days.
Wenger admits the possibility of getting stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe that the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
“Sometimes when you get back in line after an injury, you’re vulnerable for a while — during that time you need to regain strength and gain a competitive advantage,” Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he recovers physically, I am sure of that, as well as that his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal starts the campaign in the Champions League on Wednesday with a match with Dynamo Zagreb and will continue it on Saturday with games with Chelsea and next Wednesday with Tottenham Hotspur, and Wenger intends to rotate the lineup.
Hector Beljerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so most likely in the starting line-up will play Mathieu Debussy and Arteta.
Wenger may also introduce Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux in place of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
“I’m trying to keep the balance and give a little respite to those players who need it,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is the absolute favourite in Group F, the Maksimir stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of the 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as "Invincibles".
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned the lesson learned last season when the team was defeated in the Champions League by Monaco, and remains with little hope of leading the club to victory in the Champions Cup final.
“It’s an incredible drive,” Wenger said.
Arsenal have never done this before.
We were very close to the goal in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially considering how desperate men’s need for honesty has become, now more than ever, with the suicide rate among young men at its highest in 15 years.
In 2013, it was the single largest cause of death for men between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to understand the problem, Campaign Against Unhappy Life declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of this battle to take on this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has a sufficiently large number of friends "in a normal mood", the chances of healing are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the chance of mental disorders.
But, of course, in order for friendship to work, first of all, it must be.
In an era where communication is managed by social media, where style is preferred to content, response speed is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving, and successful, even when in reality loneliness reigns.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as a billionaire video game creator recently noticed, money is not really buying any more happiness.
The advantage of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was determined not by their work, but rather by the personality that manifested itself in communication with friends.
Joey’s humor and Chandler’s constant hugs, moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, Ross’ sighs at Rachel – all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As Samaritans told me, “...my role as a listener for people who feel depressed and suicidal emphasizes how even the slightest communication from friends can benefit.”
Often the men who come to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old teaching of “live with it” is strong, as is the feeling that frank conversation about problems can be perceived as weakness.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlights the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, and long-term support comes from the immediate circle of family and friends.
So if you’re visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where you’ve completely restored the scenery for the holiday, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a single person at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You can’t predict in advance what the benefits of friendship are.

Di Maria scored a goal, helping PSG to defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria along with Blaise Matiudi and Edinson Cavani celebrates the goals scored in the gate "Malmo".
Angel di Maria, debuting in the Champions League, scored a goal that allowed PSG to easily bypass Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League game with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc de Princes Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored the ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League as a PSG player began to set the direction for the French champions, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Donetsk Shakhtar in Group A, Pari needed to take a good start in the game against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not at qualifying for the playoffs, but to continue the series of successful games of the last three seasons, where they reached the quarterfinals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision on the part of Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in the attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, deliver problems to the opponents and play well in defense is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to finalize during the season,” Blanc said.
It's promising.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I regret that we didn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the substitutes in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with 2: 2 in the match with Bordeaux in the Premier League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the background by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker was noted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after he was bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why, when he ran on a pass from Marco Verratti behind Malmö's defense and beautifully completed the attack, sending the ball past Johan Willand to the far goal.
However, if someone expected then from PSG an easy and great victory, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, which beat Celtic in the playoffs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the field at the start of the game, five defenders and two midfielders in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But, with the exception of Nicola <0xC4><0x90>ur<0xC4><0x91>i<0xC4><0x87>'s blow, in which the ball flew past the far bar of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked very little.
However, PSG sometimes failed itself with ineffective transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half failed to realize at least five attempts, and then failed to process the ball scored by Kavani immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved to be much more adept at precise passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted punch, which passed to the bar past Wieland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimovic rigged the ball sent to the center of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas that Malmö had about returning to the game, and it was only by intercepting the ball from a close distance that David Luis was prevented from increasing the final score before Essequel's replacement, Lavessi, was not counted as a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class above his team, while the Norwegian said: "Our last game in the Champions League took place in December last year."
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, and that is not the level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Glory to "Money"!
It was a wonderful match with them.
Glencore Earns $2.5 Billion in Stock Sales
Switzerland-based mining and trading giant Glencore, which has been hit by falling commodity prices, has earned $2.5 billion in share sales as part of its grand plan to reduce debt.
London-listed Glencore said it had sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in commodity prices as China’s downturn worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the release of new shares at a discounted price, Glencore’s stock price on the London Stock Exchange soared at early morning trading on Wednesday.
Stocks jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which traded 0.69 percent higher when it opened.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of its extensive plans to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents apiece, a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
It has placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company’s charter capital.
Concerns over the continued downturn in China’s economy have driven down the cost of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper and other raw materials have fallen in price by 20-40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
This visit, Xi Qingping’s first visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response visit to President Barack Obama’s visit to Beijing in November last year, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping with wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner on the evening of the same day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
“President Xi Jinping’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the presidents of the United States and China to constructively address controversial issues,” the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading American technology companies en route to Washington, D.C., and then travel to New York to attend the September UN General Assembly.
Obama and Xi Jinping are expected to discuss a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about alleged cyber espionage by China and China’s growing assertiveness over the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims to Denis Mirzoev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Dorogomilov court in Moscow sentenced Denis Mirzoev, who fatally shot down a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Prospect in Moscow.
According to the Russian news service, Mirzoev received a sentence of two years in prison in the colony-settlement.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of traffic rules and the operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor asked Mirzoyev to be sentenced to three years in prison and to recover from him the claims of the victims in full - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three o’clock in the evening in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Avenue.
The BMW car, which Mirzoev was driving, crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the sidelines.
The man born in 1989 died on the spot from his injuries.
Friends of the deceased on social media reported that the driver of BMW drove at high speed and before the accident drove to the opposite lane.
Fearing that the driver will try to escape responsibility, the bikers organized a motor race from the Vorobiev mountains to the building of the Moscow GUMVD on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation after the interrogation detained the alleged culprit of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man was detained in the temple.

More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the regional government’s presidium.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools of the Nizhnetavdin district, for the overhaul of the regional hospital in the Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will go to the completion of the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic department.

The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
On September 17-18, the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi, in which a Tyumen delegation led by the governor will take part.
Vladimir Shuglya, Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, who was part of the official delegation, tells about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the goals of the Sochi forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is based on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links between the two states.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will take part in the plenary session.
The plenary and sectional sessions will discuss the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, regulatory support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this testifies to the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
There will be trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would like to add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk in June last year.
It was attended by more than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important agreement on cooperation between the Tyumen and Minsk regions was signed.
The importance of our work is also evidenced by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, the delegation of the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to determine additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the field of agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev, it was about cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions.
The issue of supplies of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
Problems in the work of the Tyumen trading house "Belshin" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, as investment projects should work clearly and bring profit to the region.
We talked about further deliveries of passenger and cargo equipment of JSC MAZ, the development of the service center of JSC MAZ, which was created in Tyumen on the basis of JSC TPATP.
The conversation also touched upon the preparation of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of the conversation was the completion of the agreement on trade, economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation between the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promises to reach a new level.
These issues also concern the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already “breathing on incense”, so a new batch of cars from Belarus is needed, which will run on gas, environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Elevator Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of lift products of Mogilevliftmash JSC, receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, given the programs for installing new elevators in the regional center.
I will add that within the framework of the extended powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan region Alexey Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment in the Zaural region was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of district headquarters.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow you to solve many problems directly and quickly, removing their sharpness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current conditions, it is extremely important not to destroy the backdrop, continuing to work for the future.
Matt Damon Opposes Focusing on Ethnic Diversity of People in Film Production
Matt Damon argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that it was not necessary to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the Sunday issue of Project Greenlight on HBO, the famous actor interrupted Brown as she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view on the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
“Diversity is appropriate when you’re casting for the film itself, not for the show,” Damon said.
Infuriated Brown, not believing her ears, resentfully exclaimed "Wow! Wow. Well-well" all the time, while the actor from "Martianin" gave comments live.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers.
"I would like the participants - no matter who will be the director - to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to adhere to," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
Dear White People's producer advocated for Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio to direct the film; Damon was vehemently opposed, saying that "in the end, we may not get what we want."
After this discussion was shown on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angry about the video: "Explaining the essence of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE that it hurts."
The tweet received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s remarks appear just when literate coverage of a racial theme in the media is the most pressing issue on the agenda of public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity across the country, urging lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the movement during a nomination for Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News employee Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group will be treated as a group of haters.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the movement’s leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show business figures, producers and media tycoons invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unknown whether the actor accepted the invitation and whether he met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" awards first champion
A professional climber and waiter’s assistant, Isaac Caldiero, won the first American Ninja Warrior show on Monday night, taking home a $1 million prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have managed to pass all the stages of the track with obstacles.
In the season finale, two participants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete the task and settled into a set time, becoming the first athlete in the history of "American Ninja Warrior" to pass the exhausting stage 4, but Caldiero managed the task by as much as three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the victory, which came with incredible difficulty, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
“It’s incredible to think about it, I’ve never earned or lived more than $10,000 a year,” Isaac told reporters.
And all of a sudden... I never imagined what it was like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the final and why Britten, who was the first to cross the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, money gets the fastest participant.
“If there are more than one player, the fastest player gets the prize,” Wid said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and changes life, it still receives great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels any resentment about it.
He is happy with what he has done.
He received tons of enthusiastic feedback from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his wife and children.
Jeff told me, “If I was destined to lose someone, I’m glad it was Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we switched roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will return with the eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
"Detrot Tigers" quietly bypass "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEPOLIS – The second half of the season wasn’t particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now rank last in the Central Division of the American League.
Claiming only to be a hindrance, the Tigers won brilliantly on Tuesday at the Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins missed a chance to reduce the half-game lag to the Houston Astros and take second place in the playoffs in terms of the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroiters, even for one night, it was a return to the letter F, which eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
“All the winnings are fun, no matter how they go,” said Brad Osmus, manager of Tigers.
Alfredo Simon's Pitcher "Tigers" made his contribution in supporting the attacks, resulting in Detroit scoring three points in the first two innings, then adding another one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13–9) was a pitcher in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third high-quality start in nine exits.
“I just want to finish the year with good performance,” Simon said.
The pitchers can’t quit in every game, so I want to get deeper into the game.
Appointed repulsive "Tigers" Victor Martinez managed to repulse three strikes and scored two wounds - the first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first day with three strikes since four strikes in a game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well beaten," Osmus said.
He showed himself well in the (better) quality, noticeably better in the beat work and retained this quality for the game.
After scoring three shots in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened the inning with a double on the left field line.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, making a bow, took the first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier received a strike-out from Simon before his place was taken by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overtook Moer, the only player on the way, formerly the newly appointed batter Miguel Sano, who knocked out a two-shot single to the left of right-handed Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners not in the car and comparing the wound on the second base, Verhagen managed to lead the third bassman Trevor Pluff to beat in double-play.
It was the 27th time for the top league player this season when Pluff kicked the ball into double play.
After Detroit added a security wound in the first half of the ninth inning, Moer earned the RBI a "double" in the space between the outfielders against closing pitcher "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player knocked out Sano after three strikes and received his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the temporarily untrained Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers made three shots in the first two innings against the well-deserved pitcher, who was on the list of injured until the game, missing more than a month due to inflammation of the lower back.
“Definitely not the start I would like,” Hughes said, “but as the game progressed, I became more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning.”
After the first batter reached the first base, Hughes dropped the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Walk with two outs of Wrightfielder J. D. Martinez brought out Victor Martinez, who made the single in the middle for the first wound in the game.
Victor Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez finished his 0 over 21 series with the runners in the lead position.
Third base player Nick Castellanos subsequently made a "single", bringing another wound, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to approach the third base, thereby eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, receiving a single-out "double" from the catcher James McCann and a two-out "single" from the central batter Anthony Goose, and that became 3-0.
“It was a powerful hit,” said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't beat very well, but he got right to the point.
Hughes, whose throws were considered, threw in an unreached third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed reliver A. J. Achter.
Hughes counted three shots for six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Pitcher-right "Tigers" Anibal Sanchez dropped out of the players due to the stretching of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed surgery on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to be released at the start of Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, pitcher-left Daniel Norris will leave the list of injured and go against the Twins.
Norris, who has been out with the Tigers in four starts since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's pitcher-left on July 30, has one win and one loss.
He has not participated in the games since August 20 due to stretching of the oblique muscle.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play pitcher-right Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov’s complaint on the book “Prayer to God” came to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsky court.
The South Sakhalin City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, to the decision to recognize the book "Prayer to God: its meaning and place in Islam" as "extremist material", Interfax reports, citing the chairman of the City Court Alexander Chukhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from trial participants.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
“Let them comment on such nonsense,” he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor’s Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalia Perchenko to recognize the book as “extremist material”.
Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor’s Office received an appeal complaint on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor’s office believes that they asked the court to recognize extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, and not the verses from the Qur’an.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the judge made the wrong decision,” Chukhray said.
The decision to recognize the book as “extremist material” was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, "extremist" were called quotes from the Qur'an: "We worship you and ask you for help", "Do not call on anyone besides Allah."
Kadyrov called the decision-makers on the book “devils and provocateurs”.
He called on the deputies of the State Duma to prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the Holy Scriptures.
“I firmly believe that the State Duma should adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions directly related to the texts of the Quran and other Divine Scriptures,” Kadyrov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the management of Facebook intends to jointly with the Ministry of Justice of Germany.
So, the day before, the head of the department Heiko Maas said that currently the Ministry of Justice together with the specialists of the social network is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to monitor and remove comments that are incorrect with respect to migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of the intolerant posts will receive notifications stating the reason for the deletion of their record.
Organizations whose specialists collect complaints from users of the social network about offensive posts should also contribute to the rapid blocking of illegal content.
Facebook's management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative statements against migrants and refugees, the management of the social network and the Ministry of Justice of Germany was made after xenophobic sentiment rose sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis, which swept the EU countries some time ago.
So, in Germany already overcrowded all points intended for accommodation of refugees.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former concentration camp Buchenwald.
IDPs from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
In Moscow cemeteries there will be areas for relaxation.
In the near future, several capital cemeteries will be equipped with specialized zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinskoye cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troyekurovsky cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, such sites will appear in other parts of the city.
About this portal m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of the head of the State budgetary institution "Ritual".
Relaxation zones will be small landscaped areas reminiscent of parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" cemeteries visitors will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and restore psychological strength.
In the near future, zones for relaxation will be built in Domodedovo, Butovo and Shcherbinsk cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU "Ritual", if there is a need to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to keep the existing forest massifs in the maximum possible volume.
Green plantations will serve as a living fence, which will separate recreation areas and squares allocated directly to burial sites.
The experts of the GBU "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal to refuse fences at the graves.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the GBU "Ritual" told about the readiness to engage in the installation of electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to learn GPS-coordinates and number plates of burials.
In June this year, the GBU "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles cheaper, weeks in winter, when the ground is frozen.
Over the past year, prices for all types of ritual services have risen by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a stray mushroom was found in the Yelnin forests.
The elderly man was alive, although he often spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without provisions.
It was possible to find the mountain mushroom thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
Without food or water.
He was sought by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even cynologists with dogs, but there was no result.
The man was found after a helicopter connected to the search.
That day Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the woods to get drunk and podberezoviki, but by the evening he did not return.
Relatives immediately asked for help, and the next day rescuers and indifferent residents from the neighboring village were raised to look for the fungus - only about 30 people.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter of the fire and rescue center.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the fire and rescue center of the Smolensk region, said: "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He went far, far away, somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He traveled a long distance at his age.
Miracle is still alive.
Gribnik was taken to the Yelny district central hospital unconscious, in an extremely serious condition.
Doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia of the body.
How an elderly man was able to stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors do not imagine.
Valentina Nepsha, head of the therapeutic department of the Yelnin CRB: "Appointed examination to the patient, treatment."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Considering all of his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains severe, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich every year comes to Smolensk from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather used to go to pick mushrooms, but he never deepened far into the forest.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, he is not local in principle."
I have been visiting for a few years and visiting relatives.
Well, I went for the mushrooms.
I guess he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind: in the forest you need to walk in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
In addition, it is desirable to leave traces so that you can then go back.
Emergency An-2 sat on the ground in the brotherly taiga.
Right on the ground sat in Siberia emergency An-2.
An emergency landing aircraft of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisey" made in 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no casualties or casualties, but the plane itself suffered significant damage on landing.
An-2 made a service flight.
There were three crew members on board - the commander, the second pilot and the flight mechanic, Interfax reported.
The emergency aircraft made a flight on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been brought to Bratsk.
After the emergency landing of the An-2, the Brotherly Transport Prosecutor’s Office began checking compliance with the legislation on flight safety.
An investigative team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor’s Office has left for the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed their plane with passengers due to a technical malfunction at an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi.
On the liner, the engines and on-board electronics failed, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured in the plane’s emergency landing.
Economics <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Nobel laureate: globalization
The processes of globalization should have contributed to reducing inequalities in the world.
In fact, the situation is different, the difference in incomes of the population in developing economies, on the contrary, is growing.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, says Eric Maskin, chief researcher at the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions at HSE, winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
Over the past twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And these predictions have largely come true," Muskin emphasizes.
For example, China and India have seen a significant increase in GDP per capita.
However, not everything is so cheerful.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the “rich” and the “poor” in poor countries, which is manifested in large income inequality, or rather wages.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article “Why Global Markets Haven’t Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies,” published in The World Bank Economic Review, which was translated and cited by HSE.
Together with the economist, Harvard University professor Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries increases as globalization grows.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Muskin allocates four skill levels – A and B for rich countries, C and D – for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries do not have enough qualifications to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And if C-level workers from poor countries have their salaries increased by cooperating with B-level workers from the rich, then D-level workers do not feel the growth or their salaries fall at all.
The resulting effect is that the internationalization of production will contribute to widening the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to increasing inequalities.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, a full-time professor, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision-Making, head of the mathematics department at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this field.
The solution to the problem, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the funds for this, and companies are disadvantaged to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bearing fruit in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: The living connection of time.
Derbent - one of the oldest cities in Russia - in September celebrates its 2000th anniversary.
The program of festive events includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and Open Temples Day, a historical and musical show "2000 years in two hours" and excursions to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
Medieval stones of Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arab inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens - all this seems to have come down from the pages of "A Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazar Khaganate and the Golden Horde.
The age of the Eastern Platans, which grow in the courtyard of the Derbent Juma Mosque, is equal to several centuries.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian program "Trees - wildlife monuments".
The shadow of the scattered crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor of the mosque will pour aromatic tea and treat Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, perch, mushmula, miracle cakes, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, from time immemorial, large samovars have been used to drink tea to numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in the year 115 Hijra.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: the arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The content and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Poultry owners put doves in yards, under trees, in attics.
An exciting sight is the ascent into the sky of a pack of white pigeons, similar to flashes of festive fireworks.
In order to defend against the enemy, the ancient Persians blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Walking 500 meters into the sea, this structure closed the harbour of Derbent.
In 2003, the fortress walls of Derbent were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were woven in the 5th century, and to this day the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - strips of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with a pile and without it, with a complex ornament and a whimsical border.
The construction of the city began with magals - neighborhoods with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the mosquitoes have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls and street lights remind you that you are not in the medieval, but in a modern city.
In the old part of the city preserved the details of the water supply, built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources have reached, in which local residents still collect water today.
Many derbents prefer ordinary tap water to water from proven historical fountains.
In Derbent was one of the centers of pottery crafts.
Irrigation and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were valued throughout the Caucasus.
Hands of potters and now produce wonderful ceramic products for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tight rope, on which students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship dates back several centuries.
A new trend - among cable car drivers, you can increasingly see girls.
In the premises of the former Maiden's Bath today there is a museum "Culture and life of the Ancient Derbent".
Previously, unmarried girls and brides were washed here, accompanied by girlfriends, and now anyone can see the vaulted dome hall, hot and cold pools, which have gone into the past bathing accessories.
The majority of Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are just as popular these days as they were in the old days.
The benefits of heating the body with steam are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, the body acquires flexibility and ease.
The festival "Commonwealth", which takes place on the territory of Naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethnologists from many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The yellowed sarcophagi are carved from solid stone blocks and are oriented, as is customary with the Arabs, along the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The hairdresser has been in this place for many years.
Receptions of the cyrillic craft are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can make not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town there is a house in which the exiled decembrist writer Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with his ancient monuments, life and everyday life of the citizens.
Chaikhana is a traditional club of the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench thirst, chat with friends and solve some work problems.
As in previous times, it is not recommended for women to cross the threshold of teahouses.
Derbent dance ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfecting the folk Avar, Dargin, Tata, Armenian dances.
With the onset of the evening, when the noise subsides and street lights are lit, locals sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
Typically, derbents discuss household issues.
But on the eve of the anniversary, they are increasingly recalling episodes of the unique history of their city, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
In Domodedovo there was a business "game to the airport".
There is a new form of learning in the city.
Four hundred students tried themselves in the role of airport employees.
To do this, in Domodedovo mounted models of three airfields.
The young people not only inspected and registered the passengers, but also served the planes.
All this is in the form of a business game, but in complexity it was not inferior to reality.
Late flights, two passengers with fractures on board, the ladder was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
The real airport is hell.
For the one who settled in the hangar of Domodedov - a standard set of tasks to be solved by beginners.
In one hangar fit at once three major airports from different countries of the world.
Today they employ four hundred students from the capital’s colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the airport.
Passenger registration, aircraft maintenance, baggage turnover - even buses on the flight field, staircases and passenger inspection were entrusted to them.
The passengers are very troubled.
One has a mess with the documents, another is late for the flight, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And you need to deal with all this, as in life - in the minimum period.
For each of these tasks, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if the airline paid them the corresponding amount for the maintenance of the flight.
"For non-fulfillment of the relevant tasks, they are fined," - explains in an interview with the program "Vesti-Moscow" financial analyst of the game Dmitry Hilko.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of training.
She has already found a place in the course of secondary vocational education.
“Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will be, in fact, new models of the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment,” says Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of training of workers and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education of Russia.
But students are not up to global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need a day off.
But the assessments for this exam had quite a material expression.
The latest smart glasses, the best I’ve ever seen!
"I received them for responding in a timely manner to a claim to our airport on Instagram," - is a satisfied participant of the game, PR-manager of the team "Airport Frankfurt" Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, so-called, took a pencil to invite to his work by the time he finished his studies.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The U.S. Embassy in Russia has expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature at the Library.
The center has been working in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian government to close the U.S. Embassy Center at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I.Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation recently call into question the Russian government's commitment to ties between the Russian and American peoples that have not been broken even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement.
The American Center created deep and strong ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was a center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place with numerous American prominent figures, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Just last year, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat said.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to crack down.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Svatanter Kumar’s desk, hearing his claims to the work done.
The court is not satisfied with the quality of your work.
We didn’t give you a 110-page order to make fun of it,” Kumar says.
If one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During this time, the Tribunal managed to consider more than 10,000 lawsuits related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to discontinue construction leading to pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since the declaration of independence of industrial development, India has grown from a virgin jungle country to one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
Particularly acute is the problem in large metropolises, where the development of infrastructure does not keep pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and few remaining residential areas are cut down for construction by new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, NZT is regularly criticized by the government of Narendra Modi, as it often becomes the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May, the Minister of the Environment called the court’s decisions “extreme” and “impossible”.
Sometimes it is really impossible to comply with court decisions within the time limit set by the court, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
However, impossible deadlines also have a positive side: at least they force the responsible persons to move.
“Its main goal is to shake up this system,” adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly canceled major constructions: it has suspended the construction of an airport, a power plant and hundreds of smaller structures.
At the same time, people are also trying not to forget: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which contaminated the local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
“People will lose their jobs,” Kumar said.
However, such explanations do not always find understanding in ordinary people, whose life can change thanks to a single sketch of the judge's pen.
In April, the Tribunal decided to ban all vehicles over 10 years of age from entering the capital, which caused widespread outrage.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse this decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government about incoming and outgoing vehicles, and also made a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, having previously learned at the factories whether they were able to fulfill such an order.
As sources of pollution such as landfills, fuel quality and even road accidents began to fall into the court’s attention, popular anger began to subside.
But the most ill topic of the principled judge was the program for cleaning up the Ganges River, with the pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a river sacred to the Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to screaming.
You know what the word "holy" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and there were faeces in it, - the judge is fervent.
You continue to pollute the river because you think, Ganges is Ganges, it will take away all our sins.
It’s a river we worship, and look at what you do with it every day.
The clean-up of the Ganges is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, the number of fecal bacteria in this river exceeds the norm by more than 120 times.

Xi Jinping calls for a more open economy for the world
The economy needs to become more open to the world to spur its growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in a speech to a group facing the challenge of leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing participants in the 16th meeting of the Committee of the Central Lead Group on Comprehensive Deepening of Reforms.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The lead group adopted a number of directives, including introducing regulation of investor access to the market, changing the rules of border control, encouraging public enterprises (SOE) to attract private capital and revising the registration system of residents.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be compiled.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more meaningful role in allocating resources, ensuring business legitimacy and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers it gives to companies, ensuring that companies run their own businesses.
The statement also said China would allow border regions to develop new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
Even more areas will be available to private investors in order to increase the openness of government-controlled sectors of the economy.
“The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies, as well as provide them with better conditions,” the statement said.
The procedure for applying for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or “green card”, will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the filing process itself.
