In addition, the Welsh MPs are concerned about what they look like as marionettes.
Some MPs do not understand why their parliamentary status should change to the status of a "member of the Parliament of Wales".
Deputies were outraged because of plans to change the name of the local assembly to the name of the "Parliament of Wales".
All political parties believe that this is a scam.
One Labour MP said his colleagues were concerned that it rhymes with the words “stupid” and “subtly”.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "subversive".
She said the group was not happy and offered alternatives.
Welsh conservatives said their group was ready to discuss the change of the name of the assembly, but noted that it was a short verbal transition from a Welsh parliament member to a “marionette”.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently developing a draft law on amendments to the title, made a statement: "The final decision on any description of what the deputies of the Assembly call, of course, will be a matter for the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gives the Welsh East the right to change its own name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a national consultation on proposals that showed broad support for naming the assembly as the Parliament of Wales.
As for the title of additional MP, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament or the CNC, but the PMC option received the most support during the public consultation.
Additional MPs obviously offer alternative options, but the way to reach consensus could be a headache for chairwoman Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit a bill of change within a few weeks.
The reform legislation will include other changes in the work of the Assembly, such as the rules on disqualification of additional deputies and changes in the structure of the committee system.
Additional deputies will hold a final vote on the question of what they should be called if they are doing their legislative work.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, voters voted to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or against it.
A national vote was organised to resolve a long-standing issue with neighboring Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, which has hampered Macedonia's inclusion and membership in the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Macedonian President Gheorghe Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, said he would not take part in the vote.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just a cost to pay for joining the European Union and the North Atlantic Alliance.
Church of St. Martin's is silent, churches in Harlem are fighting for existence
“Earlier, as the old people I spoke to said, there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“There’s no one here today, no one here.”
He said that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People have different relationships and relationships at the moment,” he said.
“Bars are no longer cosy local living rooms where people go all the time.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for such a long period as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they will return to where they started.
“Churches,” he added, “can be replaced by residential houses with condominiums filled with people who will not help the temples that will remain in the area.
“The vast majority of residents who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and so it will speed up the day when these churches close together, because it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these condominiums will become parishioners of these churches.”
Both churches were built by the White community before Harlem became a black district – the Church of the Holy Communion in 1870, the Church of St. Martin – a decade later.
The original white methodical community left in the 1930s.
The black community, who prayed nearby, received the right of ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was captured by the black community under the leadership of the proponent John Howard Johnson, who led the boycott of merchants at the main shopping mall in Harlem's 125th Street, where they refused to hire or promote blacks.
The fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged, but the faithful under the leadership of Father Johnson planned the reconstruction: they put into operation the corilions.
The prophet David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in the Church of St. Martin, proudly called the corillon "the names of the poor people."
The expert, who played at the corillon in July, called it differently: "Cultural treasure" and - "indispensable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that this was the first in the world to be played by black-skinned musician Dianisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago switched to a larger bassoon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merivezer said that he had not been replaced in the Church of St. Martin.
What has happened in the Church of St. Martin over the past few months has been a complicated story between architects and contractors, some of whom have been attracted by false church leaders, others by the diocese.
The meeting of the faithful – the governing body of the parish, which consists of the chaplain’s assistants – was written to the diocese in July with the warning that the diocese was “trying to transfer expenses” to the meeting of the faithful, although the assembly did not take part in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some residents complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark paralyzed a 13-year-old boy while diving to catch lobsters in California.
On Saturday, the shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy who was hunting lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m. near Bacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming, asking for help, and then floating with the others to help get him out of the water.
At first Hamel thought it was just a thrill to catch lobsters, but then he “realized that something bad had happened: ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
“All his collarbone was torn,” said Hamel, adding that he noticed this when he approached the boy.
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: “In the water next to the shark!” – added Hamel.
The boy was transported by air to the Raidy Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
Rescuer Captain Larry Giles told a media briefing that the shark had been spotted at the site weeks earlier, but it was decided it was a safe species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries to the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed approaches to the beach from Ponta Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Essinitas for 48 hours for investigations and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered safe.
Sainsbury's plans to move into the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to work with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, opening beauty department stores in department stores where trained professionals will work.
As part of a significant promotion to the British beauty market with a turnover of 2.8 billion pounds, which continues to grow, while sales of fashionable clothing and household goods are declining, larger beauty ladies will be presented in 11 salons across the country and also in other new salons in the next year.
Investments in beauty come because supermarkets are looking for a way to fill the shelves that were previously occupied by TVs, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it would double the volume of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which will appear for the first time.
The existing range from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space in branded departments similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
Larger stores are also relaunching their Boutique cosmetics line, so most of the products will be suitable for vegans, and this trend is becoming increasingly popular among young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and the second will open in Sally Oak (Birmingham) at the end of this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of products daily in local stores near the house leads to supermarkets having to make more efforts to be more attractive to visitors.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said retail outlets will become more and more like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to compete with Aldi, Lidl's discounters with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores, as well as several Habitats outlets since it acquired both networks two years ago, which he said contributed to the growth of food sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
A previous attempt by supermarkets to renovate their beauty departments and pharmacies has not been successful.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but an attempt to split the proceeds from pharmacy stores ended after a series of dismantling in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after three years ago Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business along with 281 Celesio stores to the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
Lloyds has played its part in this by expanding the range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look of our beauty salons to improve the conditions for our customers.
We have also invested in the training of our employees, who will be able to offer their recommendations.
Our range of brands is designed with any needs in mind, and the attractive environment and convenient location make us a better home of beauty that resists the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones was furious after Holly Willoughby gave up a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby dropped a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand, which specializes in the image of life, to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
There is no time in Willoughby for Truly's brand of home goods and accessories.
The couple's business has become similar to the brand Gwyneth Paltrow Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old broadcaster announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragon's Den star Peter Jones, who is now parting ways with his lucrative branding business to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was enraged when a "golden" television girl confessed during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowe (Buckinghamshire), that her new deals worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million in loans meant that she would have more than enough time.
The business was similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was doubled to double Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK and headed to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: "Truly was Holly's main friend.
It was her long-term future, which she will see in a couple of decades.
Her decision to resign has left all participants completely stunned.
No one wanted to believe what was happening in the car, very soon had to start lunch.
The Marlow headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the care of the leading This Morning, which is among the most significant British stars, may cost the company millions due to huge investments in various goods – from pillows and candles to clothes and household goods, as well as due to possible further delays.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tarai Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly & Capp in 2016, and the 52-year-old Jones joined the presidency in March.
The couple rests together, and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television firm.
Willoughby will be a representative of the M&S brand and will replace Aunt McPartlin as the leading ITV “I am a celebrity”.
Last night, a source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on his affairs.”
I'm sorry, but "we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for his comment, which he considers “non-presidential” for being positive about the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump refusing to do so much?
Trump said with his parade-like "dictator's" voice.
“I don’t give up on anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in June in Singapore was declared by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the denuclearization talks have been stalled.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Lee Yong-ho, told the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North had not awaited "appropriate measures" by the United States in response to North Korea's previous disarmament steps.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to apply sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
“We are very successful in building relations with North Korea,” he said.
“Everything could have ended in a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results: completion of missile tests, assistance in the release of hostages, and the return of U.S. troops to their homes.
And he defended his unusual approach in the conversation about relations with Kim.
“Being on the side of the president is very easy, but instead of 10,000 people trying to infiltrate this crowded arena, we already have about 200 people there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds of people.
For example, after the earthquake in V. Lambok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were unnecessary.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lamboco's population has been resettled, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a necessary condition for international assistance.
“Unfortunately, in many cases it was clear that they were not seeking international assistance, so it was a bit difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children Foundation (Save the Children) and assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on the ground.
Mr Sutopa, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies will be allowed to provide assistance.
Despite the earthquakes that have always plagued Indonesia, the country is still well prepared for the unexpected nature.
Despite the fact that they were built in Ochsenye, in other coastal settlements there are almost none.
The apparent shortage of sirens to warn of a tsunami in Palu has led to more casualties, though there has been a warning.
Even in the best of times, moving between the many islands of Indonesia has been a difficult task.
Natural disasters have made it more difficult to navigate.
The hospital ship, which was located on the Lambok for the treatment of earthquake victims, is approaching Pal, but the path to a new place of disaster will take at least three days.
President Joko Widoda has focused his election campaign on improving Indonesia's ruined infrastructure and spent money on highways and railways.
But the lack of funding is chasing the Jock administration, as there will be new elections next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressure from long-standing interfaith tensions in Indonesia, where representatives of the Muslim majority embrace a more conservative Islam.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands expelled from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows and other cold weapons.

The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
At a press conference, the representative of the agency Sutopa Purvo Nugrokha said that according to reports, many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed as a result of an earthquake of 7.5 points, which occurred on Friday and caused waves up to 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, has been flooded with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed.
The investigation into the murder began after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 07:55 with gunshot wounds in the Grayson-Muses area of John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have called on people from the area to contact them if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to address anyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead or seen or heard anything suspicious and ask them to contact us.
I also encourage everyone, in particular taxi drivers, videographers who may have filmed a video, to contact us as they may have information that is extremely important to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman, whose body was found, lived near Birkenhead and was found in her own home.
A woman's friends came to the scene today to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are in the process of informing the victim's closest relatives.

Cromwell's parliamentary statue was the last century's memorable blow to the cause of "rewriting history".
His removal would be poetic justice for his similar to the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Creek’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate over the demolition of the statue, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's monument near Westminster Palace would become the object of these actions.
The Iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps the bad Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Mr. William Ham Thornicroft's vivid portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century thought and part of the historiography of the figure, which many believe is still to be honored.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell has been known by many since the late nineteenth century better than today as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case it was a monarchy.
Whether this is a completely accurate representation, the subject of long historical debates.
There is no doubt that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individually cognitive figure representing one side of this clash.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be honored and honored.”
The killer pig mutilated until the death of a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
“A man known only by his name – Yuan – was found dead with a torn artery and blood spilled, next to a barn in Lupanshui market in Guizhu province,” the South China Post reported on Sunday.
The pig farmer was preparing to introduce the swine vaccine in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Sinina, Qinghai Province, China.
He and his cousin arrived on Wednesday from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and saw that the door in the next swineyard was open.
He said that there was a large blood clot in his mouth.
According to the report, the forensic medical examination confirmed that the 550-kilogram muzzle mutilated the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were covered and damaged,” said a cousin from Wu (according to Guiyang Evening News).
Video footage from the surveillance camera showed that Yuan entered the market on Thursday at 04:40 to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The head of the market told Evening News that the pig was closed to prevent an attack on someone else, while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and the market administration are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although cases when pigs attack people are rare, they have been before.
So, in 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, as a result of which the man received serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds pressed a Welsh farmer to his tractor and held it until his wife repelled the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that the pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
“They’re just sloppy.
They're smart and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to give them the proper amount of respect,” he said.
Remains of Hurricane "Rose" will bring heavy torrential rains to the southwest of the United States.
According to the forecast, Hurricane "Rose" is weaker, as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, "Rose" will bring flooding in northern Mexico and in the southwest of the United States.
The speed of "Rose", a Category 1 hurricane, was 85 mph at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday, and it was recorded 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
"Rose" is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form an area of low pressure, moving to the east, to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday, the "Rose" will approach the peninsula of Lower California in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a deep tropical wetland.
On Monday, the "Rose" will bring up to 10 inches of precipitation to some parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical moisture, which interacts with the incoming low-pressure area, will cause strong summers in the southwest in the coming days.
In places from 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will cause dangerous sudden flooding, sedimentary currents and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will cause rainfall in places to reach 2-3 inches per hour, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some areas of the northwest, especially in most of Arizona, 2 to 4 inches of precipitation are expected.
Due to the ungrouped areas of tropical rains, sudden flooding is possible under the condition of rapid deterioration of conditions.
It would be very undesirable to walk into the desert on foot due to the possibility of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rain can lead to the fact that the canyons turn into turbulent rivers, and the rain will be accompanied by whirlwind and dust.
The incoming low-pressure area will bring in places heavy rain in a portion of the coast of Southern California.
Possible total rainfall of more than half an inch can lead to a slight debris flow and make the roads slippery.
This will be the first day of the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona at the end of Sunday and early Monday before it rains everywhere at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread in the area of the Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue to Wednesday.
In October, there may be severe temperature changes in the United States as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to a sharp change in temperature in the near future.
There is a good example of a sharp drop in temperature in the central U.S. on Sunday.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska), St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the temperature difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the long summer heat will try to intensify and expand again.
It is expected that in many central and eastern states of the United States will start a warm October with a temperature of 80 degrees - from the southern plains to parts of the North-East.
New York's temperatures could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows a high probability of higher temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearings of Bret Cowan.
More than 20 million people on six television networks watched interesting testimonies of witnesses on Thursday in the Supreme Court case between Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual violence that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political confrontation continues, broadcasters interrupted their regular programs in favor of breaking news on Friday: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI: it consisted of conducting a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent certain that a drunk Kavanaugh had grabbed her and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in his testimony that he was 100% certain that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday were looking at him.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The data was not immediately available to other networks that showed this, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And at Nielsen, there are usually problems with the evaluation of people who watch TV in the offices.
For comparison: the size of the audience is the same as when playing the playoffs or the Oscars.
“Fox News, whose experts strongly supported Kavanagh’s appointment, managed all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day,” Nielsen said in a statement.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
“CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million,” Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in the drama on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office issued a statement that he would vote in support of Kavanaugh, he was caught by CNN and CBS on Friday morning as protesters yelled at him and as he tried to climb the elevator for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes as he was barking, and it was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
He said, “You have power, but many women are deprived of it.”
Flake said his office published the statement, and said before the elevator closed that he still had something to say at the hearings in the committee.
All cable and broadcast networks conducted live broadcasts for several hours, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote on the issue of the nomination of Kavanaugh's candidacy under the Senate quorum.
But Flake said he would do so only by realizing that the FBI would consider the charges against the candidate next week, which Democrats in the minority are calling for.
Flake was persuaded in part by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Koons.
After talks with Koons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was valid because it was obvious that Republicans wouldn't have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation into the charges against Cowan at the FBI.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” over Brexit
During an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of planning to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In one of the interviews next to her on the front page of the paper was her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who opposed her so-called “shape” Brexit plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EC should have single tariffs was “quite inappropriate”.
Murder of Wade Sims: Police have arrested LSU player Dayteon Simpson.
Police arrested a suspect in a deadly shooting at Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana team.
“The 20-year-old Dayteon Simpson has been arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges,” Baton Rouge police said in a statement.
Officials showed a video of the shooting between Simms and the Simpsons, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the shootout.
“Police took the glasses from the scene and said they had Simpson’s DNA on them,” said WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson's interrogation, police said he confessed to the death of Wade.
“The cost of the bet is set at $350,000,” – says Advocate.
East Batan Rouge's Investigative Office released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Louisiana State Police's Department of Operations, the state police's criminal laboratory, and the South University Police Department are asking residents of the area for assistance in an investigation that would facilitate the arrest.
Sports Director of the University of Louisiana Joe Aleva thanked the law enforcement agencies of the area for "care and striving for justice".
Sims was only 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for the University of Louisiana team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points, 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, Louisiana University basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "destroyed" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"That's what I'm always worried about," Wade said.
Volcano throws out ashes in Mexico City
The ash, which is erupted by the volcano Popocatepetl, reached the southern areas of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was active and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were registered within 24 hours.
There was a noise in the center and there was a noise.
Images on social media showed that in the surroundings of Mexico City, such as S<0xC3><0xA1>chim<0xC3><0xAD>lka, there are thin layers of ash coating on the car windshield.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is located 45 miles (72 kilometers) from the southeast of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goya, has been active since 1994.
Clash of police with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence supporters clashed with police for the protection of public order, and thousands more joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of a polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked separatists, who were held back by the police for the protection of public order, threw eggs at them and blossomed in powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Later that day, fighting broke out when police used their batons to deter demonstrators.
For several hours, groups of independence fighters who chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" were confronted by the union figures present, shouting "Live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were treated for minor injuries received during the protests.
Tensions in the region, which is seeking independence, remain high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal, but which was noted by Catalan separatists.
Voters in the vast majority preferred independence, although voter turnout was low, which was largely explained by the boycott of the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations across the region as a result of the actions of angry demonstrators.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of Spain's national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to go the other way.
Narcissus Thermes, a 68-year-old electrician who is present at the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hopes for the prospect of gaining Catalonia's independence.
“We had one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we are tired,” he said.
Despite a vital but minor victory in last December's regional elections, Catalonia's pro-independence parties have struggled to keep the momentum this year with many of their most prominent leaders and have found themselves either in voluntary exile or in jail, awaiting release.
The 42-year-old mechanic, Joan Puig, who is recording a protest in support of the police on the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting tougher,” he said.
On Saturday, Ariel Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in jail since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year's European Parliament elections.
“The nomination as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repressions that we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
LONDON: Man arrested after breaking into house in a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after their car repeatedly crashed into a house in London.
The incident took place in the area of Belinagard-Crecent on Thursday around 19:30 British time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blamings said the gate and the building had been damaged.
At some point, a bullet may have been fired into the car.
As a result of Mang's blow, "Livingston" wins over "Rangers" with a score of 1:0
Manga's first goal in favor of "Livingston" ensured their victory
The success of Livingston stunned the Rangers, and this was enough to appoint Steven Gerrard after his several defeats in 18 games as manager of the club Ibrox.
Mangy's strike was excellent, as Gary Holt rose to one level with the Hibernian in the second division.
Gerard's team this season will not win at the exit in the Premier League and next Sunday will meet with the leaders, the Harts team, who are behind by eight points.
Prior to this, the "Rangers" in the Europa League will host the Vienna Rapid on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has extended its win-win series in the division to six games, with head coach Holt still feeling a loss after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingstan" misses the chance due to rough visitors
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they killed, but such a direction caused the Rangers a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but lost his chance to kill at the gate, after which Alan Litgov was only able to direct his efforts wider to meet Craig Halkett's blow.
The hosts were happy to allow the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could disturb the guests at some point.
This is how the main goal was achieved.
The Rangers allowed a penalty kick, and Livingston made their debut, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to overcome Menga, who scored a pass and scored from the center of the field.
To this point, "Rangers" with dominated, but it turned out that the defense of the team is unsuitable, and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was almost not involved
The same thing continued in the second half, although Alfredo Marelas actually saved Kelly.
The ball from Scott Pittman was repulsed by the Rangers' goalkeeper Alan McGregor, and Lithgow moved far away from the second set of Livingston.
Balls were constantly hitting the gates of Livingston and were repelled, while two penalty demands, after being challenged by Halkett to replace Glen Middleton, and a penalty requirement for handball, were rejected.
“The Phenomenon” from “Livingstan” – analysis
BBC Scotland journalist Alesdair Lamant at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and results for "Livingston".
For men, they were wonderful, continuing to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition have not changed since their return to the upper echelon, but it is worth paying homage to Holt for the way he has stimulated the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was grandiose, building a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Woral everywhere in the field.
The Rangers were not inspired.
No matter how good they were at Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
In the last match they did not own the ball, only once scoring in the goal, which was a kind of alarm bell for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the list.
Confusion with Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, smiles were seen and there was a sense of unreasonable lethargy when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They quarreled over human rights issues, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EC.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is on his way to Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
Police rescued on security grounds to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of whom were Kurds, also voiced their opinions, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The pros and cons of the protests reflect disagreements over the guest, who was declared a hero by some German Turks and was condemned as an autocrat by others.
Accident in Deptford: A biker was killed in a collision with a car
The driver was killed in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, the medical staff arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred months after another rider died in a collision on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan Police said their employees were working to identify the man and report him to his closest relatives.
There are road fences and bus stops nearby, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Prison "Long-Lartin": six employees injured during the riots
"Six prison officials were injured as a result of riots in a strict men's prison," the Penitentiary Administration said.
Riots broke out at the Long Lartin prison in Worcester around 9:30 a.m. British time on Sunday and continue to this day.
For the fight against riots, in which eight prisoners are involved in one wing, a special group "Tarnada" was involved.
At the scene of the accident, the workers were treated for minor injuries.
A spokesman for the Penitentiary Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel were sent to fight those who committed riots in the Long Lartin prison.
Six patients were treated after receiving the treatment.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the culprits will be turned over to the police and can spend more time behind bars."
The Long Lartin Royal Prison holds more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison underwent treatment in the hospital after the attack of the prisoner.
And in October last year, police officers for the protection of public order were summoned to prison to deal with serious riots, during which employees were attacked with balls for water polo.
Hurricane Rosa threatens the cities of Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with severe flooding (which can be beneficial for arid regions)
Tropical hurricanes are rare in Arizona, but this is exactly what could happen early next week, because there are traces of hurricane "Rose" in the southwestern part of the desert, which poses a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service on Monday and Tuesday released data on sudden flooding in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, and Las Vegas.
It is expected that on Tuesday, "Rosa" will go directly through Phoenix, approaching with rain on Monday evening.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only “ten tropical cyclones have brought a tropical storm or pressure drop within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the border with Arizona.
The latest model of the National Hurricane Center predicts rainfall from 2 to 4 inches, while in some places the level can reach 6 inches in the Magallona area of Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall from 1 to 2 inches, with individual result values reaching 4 inches.
For those who are beyond the risk of sudden flooding, Hurricane Rose could be a long-awaited one, as their region suffers from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of these precipitations are likely to be useful as droughts are currently observed in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Agency, at least slightly more than 40 percent of Arizona’s territory is experiencing an extreme second-category drought,” reports weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane "Rose" leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
On Sunday morning, the Rose still had the strength of a hurricane with a maximum wind of 85 miles per hour at 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico, and is moving north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will collide with colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore cool down.
Thus, it is expected that in Mexico, when a tropical storm arrives, rivers will leave the shores during the day or at night on Monday.
Precipitation in different parts of Mexico can be strong, which creates a significant risk of flooding.
“The total rainfall is expected to range from 3 to 6 inches from Lower California to northwestern Sanlra, where up to 10 inches are possible,” reports weather.com.
The Rose will then move north through Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning in the form of a tropical pressure drop, which will then continue to move through Arizona and southern Utah until Tuesday evening.
“The main danger is expected from the Rose or its remnants, it is very heavy rains in Lower California and in the northwest of Sanora and the southwestern desert of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to lead to life-threatening and sudden flooding and rural flows and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Attempts to Arrest Murderers
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old boy were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after finding a 16-year-old body with multiple knife wounds in Summerset.
Three teenage boys were found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Northon around 4 o'clock on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remained in a "stable" state.
“A 17-year-old boy and both others, 18 and 20, were arrested overnight in the Redstock, Avon and Summerset neighborhoods,” police said in a statement.
The police appealed to anyone who could have any evidence on their mobile phone of what had happened to move on in their search.
“Kavano is being overrun by the submissiveness and anger of the Democratic Party,” Trump said.
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the reversal of the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, East Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "suffers from the submissiveness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination to the post.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, intensely and emotionally denying Christina Blacy Ford's accusations that he sexually raped her for decades when they were still teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearings about her accusations.
On Saturday, the President said that "on this day, the Americans saw a brilliant, high-quality and courageous character" Kavanaugh.
“The voice in support of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for one of the most accomplished legal experts of our time, a lawyer with an excellent history of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president immediately salvaged Kavanaugh's nomination, talking about the importance of the Republicans' turnout during the midterm elections.
“Five weeks remain until one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just late, I'm really late," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump does not agree that the Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
"It is expected that the first key procedural vote at the Senate level on the nomination of Kavanaugh will take place no later than Friday," a senior assistant to the leadership of parliament told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is growing
“At least 384 people have died, many people have disappeared as a result of the influx of giant waves on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami began on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi,” authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, as waves six meters (18 feet) high fought over the shore in the dusk, killing many to death and destroying everything in their path.
After the earthquake of magnitude 7.5, a tsunami occurred.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not immediately flee, and they became victims,” Indonesia’s disaster relief agency Sutopo Purvo Nugroho said at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami dragged cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km / h (up to 497 mph) before hitting the coastline.
According to him, some people survived only because they climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers of Palu.
Air photographs released by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were spinning and collapsing, and the mosque was surrounded by water.
Subsequent attacks continued to rock the coastal city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area with a population of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released as a result of the strong earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to him, the geography of the city, which is at the end of a long narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroha called the damage "broad" and reported that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the rubble of destroyed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
“The casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km (190 mi) north of Pal, an area called Dongala that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake,” Nugroha said.
Dongal’s communication was “completely damaged,” Nugroh said.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had been sent to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not reporting a tsunami in Palu, but officials said the waves were coming at the time the warning was made.
In amateur photos posted on social networks, you can hear a man on the upper floor of the building screaming desperately at people on the street warning of an impending tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water fell onto the shore, pulling buildings and cars behind it.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to reconcile rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began to direct cargo planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still badly needed food and other essentials.
The city's airport has only been opened for assistance and will be closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Vida planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palo.
As a result of the tsunami in Indonesia, more than 800 people lost their lives.
It's very bad.
“While World Vision employees from Danggala have successfully made their way to the city of Palu, where workers are hiding in tarpaulin hideouts installed in the courtyard of their office, along the way they have seen scenes of devastation,” Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me that they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even as relief groups launched grim actions to launch disaster relief mechanisms, some complained that foreign workers with deep knowledge were being prevented from going to Palu.
According to the Indonesian rule, funding, supplies and personnel from abroad can only begin to arrive if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government declares, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to open up to international aid, but this status has not yet been achieved.
On the second night in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family of the missing hoped that their close by miracle would be among those who would leave the hopeless plot lines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the boy was released from the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been under the rubble for two days, and next to her was the body of her child.
Gendon Subandona, the coach of Indonesia's national paragliding team, has prepared two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi, including others who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, were his students.
“Being the oldest in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional weight,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel spread to the paraglider community, he desperately sent messages on WhatsApp to Palu participants who were at the beach festival.
His messages, however, were marked with one gray tick, not two blue ones.
"This means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 during the replenishment of ATMs in Newport on the Lev
“On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from an employee of Brink, who deposited banknotes in an ATM in Newport on the Left,” the Newport Police Department said in a press release.
“The driver of the car ravaged the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money,” wrote Det. Denis McCarthy in a release.
While he was busy, another man "escaped because of the worker Brink" and stole a bag of money intended for delivery.
According to the report, witnesses noticed several suspects who left the scene, but the police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone who has information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department by phone 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye ("you").
Kanye West has changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he tweeted: "I am officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, nicknamed Ye, used the nickname as a title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The changes take place on the eve of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande for a show that was canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
Along with the abbreviation of his current professional name, West previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
I believe that “ye” is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it is “you,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with radio host Big Boy.
You are me, I am you, I am you, I am you.
It went from “Kanye”, which means “one”, to simply “Ye” – a reflection of our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.
He is one of the most famous rappers who has changed his name.
Sean Combs was otherwise known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he was leaning towards the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, Jay-Z, also did without a connection and capital letters.
Amlo in Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Abrador, has vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody repression against students.
On Saturday, in Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Abrador promised “never to use the military to suppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shot down a peaceful demonstration on the square, which killed about 300 people, at a time when leftist student movements were encroaching across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by issuing monthly grants to those studying, thereby opening up more free places in public universities.
“Unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups,” he said.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for machine intelligence.
“As China becomes more and more active in the field of machine intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the amount they spend on research in this area,” said Kai-Fu Li, an investor and machine intelligence specialist who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments came after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about MI, even if the U.S. lacks an official MI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year China presented its plan: by 2030, it aims to be the first in the field of MI innovation.
“Doubling the budget for MI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are lagging behind the U.S., and we are looking forward to the next breakthrough in MI,” Lee said.
“Double funding could double the likelihood that the next major achievement of MI will be in the US,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of Machine Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the chief executive officer of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most famous MI+ companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Melano University, he worked on a machine intelligence system that defeated the most senior American player, Atella, and later he was the head of Microsoft Research and president of Google's Chinese branch in China.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Competition, and asked if there would be another to help identify the next seers.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government grants,” Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired lights from universities to work on MI in recent years.
Lee said a change in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of machine intelligence (MI).
“In my opinion, green cards should be automatically offered to the candidate in the field of MI,” he said.
The State Council of China in July 2017 released a plan for the development of next-generation machine intelligence.
“China’s National Endowment for Natural Sciences provides funding to people in educational institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations allocate money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower,” Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Machine Intelligence Center, which should involve industry and academia partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Machine Intelligence.
And this month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency announced a $2 billion investment called AI Next.
As for the National Science Organization (NSF), it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in MI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to establish a National Security Commission on Machine Intelligence has not seen action for several months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to change their name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”, which will resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked applications to participate in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim on its territory, and has vetoed accession to NATO and the EC.
In June, both governments struck a deal taking into account the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that these changes undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Georgi Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott company questioned whether the voter turnout would meet the minimum of 50 percent needed to hold the referendum.
The question of voting on the referendum proposes: "You are in favor of membership in NATO and the EC with the adoption of an agreement with Greece."
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a cost that should be paid for admission to bodies such as the EC and NATO Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, Skopje.
Although this does not have the necessary legal force, a sufficient number of members of parliament have stated that they will take into account the results of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name will require more than two-thirds of the parliament.
The State Electoral Commission said that there were no reports of violations before 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared with 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said the 62-year-old voter in Skopje, Jose Tanevski.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zaritsa and his son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ka voted for a referendum in Macedonia, dedicated to changing the country's name, which will pave the way for its accession to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and laid out chairs in front of tents set up by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to unite with our heads raised, not through the official door," Kovadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have an honor.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.
The Prime Minister said that membership in NATO will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority will be in favour, because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EC and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the result of “yes” will be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research said the referendum would involve between 30 and 43 percent of voters, which is below the required turnout.
Another poll conducted by the Macedonian TV channel showed 57 percent of respondents who plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they were “yes.”
For a successful referendum, the ballot must be 50 percent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government since its arrival in May last year.
See: Sergio Agüera from Manchester City passes to the gates through the entire defense of "Britan"
On Saturday, Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling solved the problem with the defense against the "Britain" victory "Manchester City" with a score of 2: 0 at the stadium Etihad in Manchester, England.
In the 65th minute, Aguilera easily did so.
The Argentinian striker received a pass in the center of the field.
He raced between the three defenders of the "Britan", before hitting the open field.
Then Agüera found himself among the four green shirts.
He passed one defender and overtook several others on the edge of the British field.
Then he pushed the pass on the left flank, finding Sterling.
The English striker's first touch in the penalty kick gave the ball to Aguero, who used his right kick to circumvent the goalkeeper "Brighton" Matthew Ryan by hitting the right side of the net.
“Aguera has some problems with her legs,” city chief Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about how he played 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the same time.”
But it was Serling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguera received this ball in the depths of the territory of "Britain".
He sent a beautiful ball across the left flank to Leroy Sanne.
Sayn made a few touches before Sterling was able to reach the far bar.
The striker "Sky Blues" directed the ball into the net before he jumped over the border.

Scherzer wants to play the role of "selecting points" against Rocky
After the Nationals were excluded from the playoffs, there was no particular reason to forge a new start.
But the consistently competitive Shercer hopes to take the shot on Sunday against the Colorado Rocky, but only if there are still the consequences of the playoffs for Rocky, who remain in the lead after one game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Northwest.
The Rocks won at least the singles spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still hoping to get their first title in the division.
“Even though we’re playing just like that, at least we can handle the situation knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver, with the crowd and the other team will be made up so that the game is likely to be at the highest level of all I’ve encountered this year.
Why don't I want to compete in this?
The Nationals have not yet announced the start for Sunday, but they are reportedly inclined to give Sherzer the ball in such a situation.
Shercer, who was going to make his 34th start, held a session of the KPC on Thursday and will be on a regular holiday on Sunday.

Trump's speech in West Virginia
The president slammed the situation around his election of the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, speaking about the importance of the Republicans' turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we do is under threat in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big – I am not late, but I am really late, so I am everywhere fighting for big candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their power, using any necessary means, you see, – villainy, disgust.
They don’t care who they offend, who they have to interrupt to get power and control, that’s what they want, that’s power and control that we’re not going to give them.”
According to him, the Democrats intend to "resist and obstruct".
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “evil, deceitful, reversible and lying.”
He took refuge in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the previous recognition of Senator of the Democratic group Diana Feinstein, who received a loud appraisal from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Have you let the document go?
Uh, that.
No, I don’t expect it – it was a very bad nonverbal language – the worst language I’ve ever seen.”
Work is no longer the foundation of the church.
It's an inconvenience to those who express their opinions.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to hurt me, it was hardly a surprise.
At the end of the day, I am the last member of the Labour Party to be told that we are not welcome – all to express my opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar appeal because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
In a statement on the meeting, which was fair on Friday by the Nottingham Eastern Labour Party, it is said that “we want these meetings to be meaningful and productive.”
For most of my eight years as a local member of parliament from the Labour Party, this was the meeting that took place on Friday.
Unfortunately, today at most meetings the tone is not so and the promise of a "better, softer" policy has long been forgotten, if it really ever was.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that in the Labour Party, different views are not allowed, and each opinion is assessed from the same point of view, whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared the same political views began to expect me to take a step back and took positions that I would not agree with – on issues of national security or the EU market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there is a tirade of images on social media calling for the cancellation of elections, condemning the policy of the center, saying that I’m no longer in the Labour Party.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I am fascinated by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a stream of sexual or racist harassment on a daily basis, but never evade.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer an organization that holds different views, and with each movement of "uncertainty" or changing the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I've been given a lot of advice that urged me not to give up, not to be so loud, and then I'll be fine.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil provoked by the government’s denial of Thatcher, which made my schooling a failure, I have sought to uphold the best public services for those who need it most – whether it’s a local resident or a government official.
I have never hid my political views, including in the past elections.
No one in East Nottingham could be confused in my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who fought for this movement on Friday, I would like to say that when a country is heading towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party Leaders.
But in fact, the only message I have is not Nottingham Momentum, it is my voters, whether they will be members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that there will be no threat of cancellation of elections and political expediency will not prevent me from acting in all your interests.

Ir-Melrose 38 - 17: The Invincible Ir at the Top
The two late attempts may have somewhat indicated the final result, but, no doubt, Air deserved a triumph in this surprisingly interesting Tennent Premier League match.
Now they are leading the tournament table, the only side out of ten.
After all, it was their highest defense, as well as their best chances, which made them masters, coach Peter Murch had every right to be satisfied.
“We’ve still tried our games so far, and we’re still unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, "Give it to Aire, he's braver than we are."
A 14-minute attempt by Grant Anderson, transformed by Fraser Klim, put Ira in the foreground, but a yellow card for Scotland cap Rory Hughes, obtained for the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to juggle numbers, and Jason Baggott grabbed the unrealistic attempt.
Klimov stretched Eyre's leadership with a penalty, before, right in the break, he scored, and then made a solo attempt, making 17-5 Eyre in the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and the attempt by Patrick Anderson, transformed by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>, reduced the lag to five points.
Then there was a long delay due to the serious injury Ruarid Not, which was stretched, and after the re-start Air moved on through the attempt of Stafford McDowell, implemented by the Klims.
Air, acting as Captain Blair McPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose forced another man to pay with the help of an unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin at the end of the fierce pressure.
However, the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for kicking Klimov without a ball from the penalty line, McPherson landed behind Aira.
Klimov carried out his attempt, which he did again almost after the re-start, after Kyle Rowe received a shot from David Armstrong in the penalty area and sent Gregory Henry's flanker to the fifth attempt of the hosts of the field.
Star Still Game seems to be ready for a new career in the restaurant business
However, the star of the game Ford Kieran is about to enter the hotel industry after it turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis on the BBC's popular show, which he writes, and is filmed alongside longtime comedy partner Greg Hamfil.
The duo announced that the next ninth series will be the last in the series of shows, and it seems Kernan plans to act further after Craiglong.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source at Scottish Sun hinted that Kernan hopes to take part in a "blooming trade in Glasgow".
“Our Sea”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will once again open the way to the Pacific Ocean
The Moroccans are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings under the blue flag.
In the naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is drawn the motto "Our sea by law".
Resurrection – this is our duty.
In all Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict due to the resources of the 19th century is still alive – as is the desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may have peaked in recent decades as Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calsadilla.
Many Bolivians will be watching the ICJ's decision on big screens across the country, hoping that the tribunal in The Hague after decades of intense negotiations will support Bolivia's statement that Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia's sovereign access to the sea.
Eva Morales is a charismatic Bolivian president who faces a controversial re-election battle next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and that will make little difference, even if it does.
The United Nations, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to make a decision on the territory of Chile and said it would not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the ruling of the International Court of Justice comes out only six months after the final arguments were considered, indicates that the case “was not complicated”, – said the Chilean expert in international law Paz Zarate.
And without advancing the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have thrown it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been monopolized by the current Bolivian administration," Sarat said.
According to her, the militant rhetoric of Moroles lost the remaining Chilean benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
Since 1962, the two countries have not exchanged ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velté, the representative of Bolivia in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an exceptional opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the opportunity "to put an end to 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit," he said.
Kalsadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as a political backbone.
“Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
“It’s an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen until they can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never stop using its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
He spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restoring nuclear deadlock diplomacy with North Korean Kim Jong Un more than three months after Singapore.
Ry says it’s an “unusual dream” that long-term sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration ending the war in Korea will ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington is afraid to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not first take significant steps to disarm.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are calling for a second summit.
But there is great skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning the arsenal that the country is likely to see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion shows, we saw the newest line in massive headgear on the way to stores in your cities.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely close the sun, you can no longer look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a variety of unusual headgear for their SS19 collection, which has exceeded the expectations of Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram gained popularity with impractical hats, the designers of which sent their creations to the podium.
Valentino's distinctive feature was a luxurious beige hat, decorated with wide poles, similar to feathers, that filled the heads of the models.
Other accessories of unusually large size included watermelons trimmed with precious stones, a magician's hat, and even pineapple, but they weren't meant to keep your head warm.
Brown also showed a selection of whimsical masks – just before Halloween.
Many of the multi-colored masks were with sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One of them resembled a gear for underwater swimming with a tube and protective glasses, and the other – similar to the melted cone of ice cream.
And if you continue to stick to the huge attributes of fashion, you're lucky.
Those who follow the style predict that huge hats can break into our daily lives.
Hats of huge size go on heels to "La Bomba", a straw hat with two-foot-wide poles that can be seen in everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic label on a very uncomfortable hat, which was disbanded in social networks, contributed to another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag, almost as large as the model with this bag, dressed in a swimsuit.
A dark orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia finish and covered with a white leather handle, became an outstanding part of the Jacquesmus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer, as the designer has exerted great influence, and it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is a necessary skill for all citizens of the world
Scotland's independent schools retain achievements in academic excellence, this has been going on since 2018 with another excellent exam result that is reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland, schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are committed to providing the best level of work for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further higher education, their chosen careers and their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an individualized school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to remain a popular and desirable subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, it stays in his head.
If you speak to him in his native language, it goes to his heart.”
It's a vivid reminder that we can't rely solely on English if we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
From the results of this year's final exams, we see that languages rank first in the league tables with the highest scores in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received the highest grade A.
Data collected in 74 participating SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students had achieved a higher A-level in Chinese language learning, while 72 percent had studied German, 69 percent had studied French, and 63 percent had studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Now languages as a subject are chosen in the same way as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that among the reasons employers cited for difficulty filling vacancies, 17 percent were due to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people for a future career.
With more promising jobs requiring language proficiency, these skills are becoming necessary in a globalized world.
No matter which profession you choose, if you learn a different language, in the future it will be a real advantage if you have such skills for life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person first among competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit 15 percent.
That's why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing countries, will give children a better chance of finding a good job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in the languages it is taught.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK when looking to the future by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, independent schools will always have a choice of multiple languages with a teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish Independent Schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills necessary to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At present, it cannot be denied that in the global business environment languages are still vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be regarded as "skills of international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and preference to Scotland's youth.
It has to be done
John Edward – Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in San Diego on Sunday.
Start waiting for fans who want to see LeBron James make his first start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play at the pre-season opening Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long it will take, we still have to figure out.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on Lakers’ official website.
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell wrote that James is likely to play for a limited time.
According to the practice, which was developed this week. James was asked about his plans for "six pre-season schedules".
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
Tonight in Willing, West Virginia, President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign shares.
This is the first of Trump's five scheduled appearances next week, including stops at friendly locations, Tennessee and Mississippi.
While confirming the vote on his arrival to fill the Supreme Court's vacancy, Trump is seeking to boost support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress if votes are cast in November.
When Trump's speech starts tonight in West Virginia and how to watch it on the Internet?
Trump's speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech in West Virginia on the Internet below on YouTube live.
Trump is likely to consider a candidacy hearing this week at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who has problems with allegations of sexual harassment with expected confirmation in the Senate vote for a week during an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these speeches is to help Republicans who are facing elections in November.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign announced that these five speeches next week are aimed at “activating the activities of volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” Reuters reported.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned at the Wesbanco Arena in Willing, today’s action could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media,” reports The West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, a state in which he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who is a leader in the polls.
“This is not a very good sign for Morris that the president should come in to try and give him a push in the polls,” said Simon Hedar, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Rider Cup 2018: U.S. team advances to fight to keep hopes alive on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's fours may have been exactly what was needed for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pulsating pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, in which the players sincerely believe, and nothing more than similar competitions.
Where do you think they're going to put the momentum now?
“They had an advantage with six points, and now they have four, so I think we’re going through it with a little momentum,” said Jordan Sleep, walking through the day.
The advantage of Europe, of course, is four points ahead, and in the game there are twelve more.
The Americans, Spith says, feel that they have a slight gust of wind, and they have something to hope for, not least because of the shape of Spite and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, and each can boast of three points out of four.
Spite was deadly from t-shirts to green and is an example.
These horrendous shouts of celebration became louder as his round lasted, and he sank a decisive blow to play in the matches on four fields when he and Thomas conceded two by two.
His punch, which allowed them to win matches on the 15th, was met with a similar scream, like one that tells you that he believes the American team is not excluded.
“You just have to dig deeper and worry about your own match,” Spitty said.
All of these players are gone.
18 points to make a point.
In the last two days, the only players to score more points than Spite and Thomas are Francesco Malinara and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
Strange but magical couples in Europe four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
The "Moliwoods" were the only couple who didn't make a boggie on Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped the boggie on Saturday morning, Friday, and Friday afternoon.
This is happening, and as their energy seems to flow to and from this turbulent crowd, and it confirms that they are the players who will win on Sunday, and there would be no more popular player to close a potential victory in Europe when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or the Malinary.
Both at the same time in different directions.
It is too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did a short piece of work on Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning buffet, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Boggi and two doubles on the front nine dug the Spaniard and the Swede to him, from which they could not get out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be able to help you with your hole.
It's so interesting to watch the matches of the four balls and the fours closely because of the interaction between putting together the pairs, the tips they give, the tips they don't follow, and how the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far become the best team and took on a significant role on the last day, but this fourth meeting also shows that the U.S. team is committed to a fight that some have doubted, especially in the United States.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a score of 10-6
Europe will gain a good lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's matches of four goals and four with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
An inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Malinary led the fight against two victories over Tiger Woods to bring the results at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Björn's European side, trying to preserve the trophy they lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the U.S. dissatisfaction agency in the morning, receiving a 3-1 series.
The U.S. offered more resistance in four-ball matches, winning two matches, but they couldn't do more.
In order to keep the trophy, Jim Furrick's side needs eight points out of 12 singles matches on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and he and Malinary, named Molliwood after sensational weekends, are just the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in four balls, they remarkably fastened to defeat downtrodden Woods and U.S. recruiter Brian Decombe for another 5 and 4.
Woods, who made it through two games on Saturday, showed an accidental burst of brilliance, but now he has lost 19 of 29 times in four goals and four and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting on x four-ball matches, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the four-ball matches to the 2 & 1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepki – takes both the second place in the world.
Europe did not have its way, although it was a pleasant, fresh day south of the west of Paris.
On Saturday, three-time main winner Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set a checkpoint for the Americans with two points.
They won 2 and 1 over John Ram and Ian Pulter of Spain in four-ball matches and came back later to beat Puller and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in fours, losing two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, the team has returned from a four-point deficit, which goes alone, although in the direction of the Furyco owners you only need to draw to keep the trophy.
However, after the next two days, which were the best, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if they will succeed.
North Korea says it will “in no way” disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations continued sanctions that heightened distrust of the United States, and under such conditions the country could not unilaterally abandon nuclear weapons.
Ri Yun-ho said at the annual General Assembly of the world body that last year North Korea took "significant goodwill measures", for example, the termination of tests at nuclear and missile sites, the dismantling of the nuclear test zone and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons.
"But we don't see a proper response from the United States," he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances, there is no way to unilaterally disarm ourselves.”
Despite the fact that Ri republished the usual North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phasing-in" approach to dinuclearization, under which North Korea was rewarded because it took gradual steps, his statement proved significant in the fact that he did not respond.
Ri relied on a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit of the U.S. president and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work on the path to “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”, while Trump promised to give guarantees of security.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to lift tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States of America initially insists on ‘denuklearization’ and increasing pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, and even opposes ‘declaring the end of the war,’” Ri says.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an unremitting dream of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our distrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader celebrated earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If South Korea were a party to this issue of denuklearization, and not the United States, the denuklearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be such a dead end."
However, Ri’s tone of speech was sharply different from last year when he spoke at the UN General Assembly argued that targeting the US continent with North Korea’s missiles was inevitable after “Mr. President Evil” Trump called Kim a “missile gunner.”
This year, at the UN, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking measures to disarm, but said there would be much more to be done and sanctions should remain in place until the pair denuclearize.
In a statement, Trump said: “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue at the UN. The Security Council said that it should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary. Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that “Enforcement of Security Council sanctions should continue actively and necessarily until we are confident in full, final and verifiable dinuclearization.”
The Security Council tightened sanctions on North Korea in 2006 in an attempt to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri in the Security Council colloquium. The General Assembly then stated that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the next summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a success.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that the progress made with North Korea over hours of negotiations ended with a visa statement that he presented demands “like gangsters.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to eliminate the missile installation and the nuclear complex if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
Trump said that, according to Kim, the “appropriate measures” he expects are a guarantee of security and a desire to normalize relations with Washington, which Trump promised in Singapore.
Harvard students are taking a course on proper rest.
The new Harvard University course this year is designed to train students to sleep more, and aims to combat the culture of studying at night with coffee in hand.
The scientist came to the conclusion that students at one of the best universities in the world often do not know how to properly take care of themselves and their health.
Charles Chaisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
Inspired by the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, he began the course.
At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did they tell me this just now, in the last year of training?"
“She said that no one ever told her about the importance of sleep – it surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, the course, taught to students, explains why good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic achievement, as well as improve overall mood.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health service, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were often deprived of sleep for a week.
The course, which lasts an hour, includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room on the internet where students click on cups of coffee, curtains and books that talk about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of pre-sleep habits.
At the next stage, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The campus map, with interactive images, encourages participants to think about their daily lives.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of the students.
But we believe that they should know this as much as everyone knows about the health effects of smoking,” Chaisler added.
According to him, the culture of night parties still exists, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students leads to sleep deprivation, which turns out to be an increasing problem.
“Ensuring adequate sleep of good quality should be a ‘secret weapon’ for students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even to avoid excess weight, as sleep deprivation makes the brain constantly hungry.”
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chaisler develop the course.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to teach everyone on campus.
He hopes that the next step will be a request to all assistants to complete a similar program of study before entering the university.
Professor Chaisler recommended students the opportunity to set a clock to know when to go to bed and when to wake up, aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emanating from monitor screens and LED lighting that can change the daily mode, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1:0 Rangers: Menga scores a goal for Gerard.
The Rangers suffered another defeat when a goal by Dolly Mangy assured that Steven Gerrard would not win a 1-0 loss at the Livingston Stadium.
Aibraks wants to record his first win on his way to a 4-1 win in February in St. John's, but Gary Holton's team is already second to Gerard as a manager of 18 games to leave behind eight points behind the Ladbrokes Hearts Premier League leaders.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers team, inspired by the goal, did not seem to suffer defeat.
At the same time as the Rangers fall to sixth place, the Livingston rose to third place, behind Hibernians with a difference in balls.
For the Rangers, there may be additional problems after the forward Colum Spence has to be treated for a head injury after he has hit an object thrown from the stands.
Gerard made eight changes to the players, which is why Ira did not play in the semi-finals of the Batfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Left under 11 numbers, which allowed him to pick up a point from Hearts last week, and was thrilled by how well they circumvented their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers owned the ball more, but Livigstan made more attempts to score the ball.
They were supposed to score two minutes later when Mengy first directed the ball through Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal, and then the midfielder took the opportunity.
Jacobs Kagan's successful punitive strike caught Craig Halkett's surprise, but his defense partner Alan Litgov was able to deliver a strong blow from behind.
The Rangers took control, but in the last third of the game were more likely to score than demonstrated a good game.
Alfredo Marelas was certainly to be fined a quarter of an hour before the end when he and Stephen Lowles clashed in the field, but Judge Steven Thomson did not accept the Colombian complaint.
The Rangers managed to hit the gate only in the first half of the game, but the former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly almost gave a goal to Las<0xC3><0xA1>n Coulibaly and an effective attack on Ovi Eh<0xC3><0xA1>ria.
Although scoring the first goal in the 34th minute, Levi may have been against further active play, but no one denies that they have to demonstrate to fans a good game.
Again, the Rangers were unable to break through the Jacobs Gate.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher gave a pass to Scott Robinson, who blocked Meng for the opportunity to kill in the gate.
Gerard replaced Coulibaly at the break with Ryan Kent, and this had an effective effect when the assailant made his way to Marelas, but the impressive Kelly ran and blocked the blow.
But "Livingston" continued to please visitors, playing the game that they liked, and Lithov and Halket continued to share the ball after a long confrontation.
Holt's side could only prevail in the last minutes, but McGregor played well to stand up to Jacobs before Litgow went to the spare bench.
Rangers' replacement by Glenn Middleton happened once again after he was fined when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson managed to evade.
Almanac: Inventor of the Geiger counter.
Page from our almanac "Sunday morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and SUBLICI... the day of the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, who was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the appearance of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger's counter became part of science and appeared in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Called Coronade", which involved those seemingly little-known scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Man: Who is he on earth?
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter used to search for radioactive minerals such as uranium.
If you're putting on headphones, you really have the ability to hear the sounds of atoms radiating in minerals."
Evans: “Tell me, is it really scary now?”!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to be used.
A new progressive vaccine can help the immune system “see” cancer cells.
A new anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system “see” bad cells and destroy them.
The vaccine seems to train the immune system to recognize the bad cells that will be part of the treatment.
The method involves obtaining immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then the cells can "see" the protein, common in many cancer cells, and then re-inject the auxiliary cells.
The trial vaccine demonstrates successful results for patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who was given a vaccine that helps the immune system recognize cancer cells saw ovarian cancer disappear within 18 months.
The method involves obtaining immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the HER2 protein, common to many cancer cells, and then be reintroduced.
This was stated by Professor Jay Berzofsky from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Our results show that there is a very promising vaccine.
“HER2 stimulates the growth of several types of anti-cancer cells that fight breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer,” said Professor Berozofsky.
A similar approach to detecting immune cells in patients and "teaching" them to reach cancer cells worked well in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West began a discussion in support of Trump, bearing the title of the IAEA, after his appearance in the SNL.
That didn't turn out well.
In the studio during the evening Saturday night Kanye West was humiliated after a speech where he praised the United States. President Donald Trump said he would run for a second term in 2020.
After performing his third song in the evening, titled “The City-Pride,” when he was wearing the “Make America Great Again” hat, he spoke out against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“How many times do I talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you support Trump, he’s racist?’
"Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL launched a show featuring the lead role of Matt Damon, where a Hollywood star mocked Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the hearing of Christina Blacy Ford's sexual assault case.
Despite the fact that the performance was not broadcast, West's words popped into the frame and were uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if he's trying to get out of the West.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had a difficult time behind the scenes.
They were squealing at me behind the scenes.
He said, “Don’t go out with that hat.
They were mocking me.
“And then they say I’m in a bad place,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West went on: Do you want to see a giggle place? "Saying that he" would put on my Skperman cap, which meant that he couldn't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love.
Because of his statements at least twice removed the hearings, and representatives of the SNA were confused by the message from Veraiti. "The whole studio is silent."
West was accepted as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many with the performance of the song I Love It, dressed in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s Conservative Party leader, Candes Turner, who tweeted: “One of the most courageous spirits thank you for your support.”
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, wrote that West is just who he is, and that's always wonderful.
“But I have decided NOT to reward anyone by buying their music or clothing, or by supporting their ‘art’, which I believe embraces and promotes an ideology that is detrimental to my community.
He's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that now his "official name is Kanye West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, and followed in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg has been dubbed the Snoop Lion and, of course, a music legend who changed his name to a symbol, and then he and the artist, formerly known as the Prince.
Attempted murder in the restaurant "Belfast"
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a restaurant in eastern Belfast attacked a second man on Friday.
The incident took place in Balikhakamor, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the State Attorney's Office.
The star of "Game of Thrones" Keith Harrington embraced idealized brutality.
Keith Harrington is known for his swinging sword and the role of John Snow in the series "Games of Tables" in the action film of the medieval HBO serial
But the 31-year-old actor received the stereotype of a macho hero, which means that young boys often feel more cruel to respect.
Speaking at the Culture Sunday Times, Keith said he believed “something happened” and asked how to solve the problem of idealized brutality in the #MeToo era.
Keith, who recently married his Game of Thrones neighbor Rose Leslie, who is also 31 years old, has admitted that he feels strong about solving this problem.
“I feel personally strong guy – when we were wrong with courage?” – he said.
“Why do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the attitude we see now?”
Cat believes that television should be responsible for the appearance of brutality because of the very male characters.
He said, “What’s going on in the beginning, and what’s going on in the beginning?”
Why is it taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they need to be so confident to be a real person?
I think this is one of the biggest questions of our time – how are we going to change that?
Of course, there is something wrong with young people.
In an interview, he also admitted that next summer the series will end, and he will leave the battlefield of the series and will not do doquels or sequels to the "Game of Thrones".
From November, Keith will begin reviving the Real West Sam Shepard, who is a historical director with his brother, who is a slave.
Recently, the actor reported that he considers meeting with his wife Rose the best opportunity to complete the "Game of Thrones".
“I met my wife in this series, so I got my future family, and my life is here,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, a character who falls in love with Keith's character John Snow in this ami-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China says the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 14%.
According to health workers, more than 820,000 people have been infected in the country.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were registered.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, as it was in the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection is spread in some areas of China as a result of infection through blood transfusions.
"However, the number of people infected with HIV through blood transfusions has fallen to almost zero," Chinese officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China grows by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV infection through sex is an acute problem of the LGBT community of China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people still exists.
Because of conservative values in the country, about 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases spread from insufficient knowledge and sexual contraception.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address this global problem.
Maxine Waters denies the mischief of the data, the peril and the conspiracy theory of her parliamentarians
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied accusations that her employee posted personal information about three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat of Los Angeles has argued that claims have been made against members of the upper-right wing and their websites.
“Lies, lies, and many abominable lies,” Waters tweeted.
Published information reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers in the United States. Meaning. Lindsay Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual assault charges against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh appeared online on Thursday.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
“Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState report that the IP address of the source was linked to Waters’ office and distributed information to a Waters team member,” Hill said.
“This unreasonable allegation is completely false and absolutely false,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team, whose data, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations, in no way was responsible for the leak of this information.
This unreasonable claim is completely false and absolutely false.”
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“It’s an outrage,” Fleisher wrote.
This shows that she does not have the courage to be a member of the Congress.
If someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't get angry.
They don't have to behave inappropriately.
They should not question the motives of their accusations.
They need to be calm and gentle.
Fleischer compared Watters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavanaugh when they were accused of being too infuriated during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Nawara, a Republican candidate who runs and participates in the midterm elections, also spoke on Twitter.
"It's a resonance, if it turns out to be true," he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these false statements.
“We guarantee that the culprits will be found,” she continued, “and they will be legally responsible for all their actions that are dissipative and dangerous to any of my team members.”
A review of Johnny English Strikes Again strikes the fictional spy Rowan Atkinson.
Now it has become a tradition to look for the meaning of BREXIT in any new film with a British bias, and this bias seems to exist in the comedy and action franchise of Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title "Johnny English's Revival".
Can you tell us how stupid we look when we talk about the new possibilities of export?
In any case, the second time he appeared in print, incompetent Johnny English got the opportunity to laugh at things – his name was louder than all the comic creations that he did for non-English viewers in cinema.
It is known that he is a secret agent who, despite his clever claims to glamor, turned out to be a little like Clouseau with Mr. Bean's features and a little taco of the guy who made a single note to the Fire Choir at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
Originally, his character was based on the traveler and international mysteries of Atkins, who once played the forgotten Barclaycard, leaving chaos in his path.
There are a few good moments that have never happened before.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, and the rotor blades tapped a little on his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for a theatrical comedy is vividly demonstrated, but the humor is felt weakly, and so it is surprising especially when serious films such as Agent 007: Mission Impossible confidently offer the comedy as the main part.
Humor feels like it's not just for adults, but also for children, and even Johnny English's senseless accidents aren't as inventive as Atkins' silent films in Bean's face.
The United Kingdom's long-standing concern is serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated a super-secret community of British spies in the UK, revealing the names of all British agents on the ground, to the disappointment of a duty agent – this is, unfortunately, a small role of Kevin Eldan.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, who is a proud and mixed figure who is already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May, but there is nothing like that in the script.
Her intelligence consultants say that since every real spy will be revealed, she will have to involve some of those who are already retired.
And this means that for Johnny English himself, everything becomes more complicated: now he works as a sixth teacher in several chic institutions and gives lessons on how to be an undisguised operator: some good examples here, as England offers the Academy of Music lessons in espionage.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former longtime friend Bo, who is played by Ben Miller again.
Bo currently has a marriage tied to a submarine commander whose role as Vicky Pepperdine was a little futile.
In this way, Batman and Robin get terribly wrong things in the secret agency of the Queen, where they work again, meeting a beautiful woman, Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister receives a dangerous order from a charismatic tech billionaire who says he can solve the problems with the UK's hackers: the sinister Jason Volt, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Bow begin their action with immediate things: disguise themselves as a waiter, set fire to a French restaurant; create a pogrom, fight smugglers on board the luxury yacht Volta; English commits pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality headset to get a real life.
All the moments are stretched out for the last event, but just as pleasant and noisy, in which there is quite a lot of baby in the TV.
It's pretty good material.
And as with other films about Johnny English, I couldn't think: can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really demonstrates his talent?
The Labour Party denies that a plan is being developed to pay the British a four-day working week with a payday of as much as five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan if the British only work four days a week, but are paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on to workers the results of work done as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution, giving them an extra day off.
It was obvious that the employees would enjoy the three-day weekend, but they would still receive the same salary.
The source notes that the idea corresponds to the economic program of the party and plans to direct the country to support the workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions approved the transition to a four-day week as a good way to take advantage of the change in the economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “A planned review of the actions will be announced by the end of the year.
This will not happen now, but the four-day work week is an idea that corresponds to the views in the party and the general industrial strategy of regulating the economy for the benefit of workers.
The Labour Party is not the first to approve such an idea, the Green Party promises to hold a four-day working week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the Labour Party's aspirations are not generally supported.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the goal of party politics, and it is not considered by the party.
Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to express his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he had decided to return power from “merciless directors” and “managers” to communal enterprises.
The shadow chancellor's plans also stipulate that the current water shareholder may not receive the entire shareholding back, as the Labour government may make a "calculation" on the basis of the alleged violations.
He also confirmed that it is planned to contribute employees to the boards of companies and create joint ownership funds to transfer 10 percent of the private firm's own funds to employees who will hold annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy told for "60 Minutes" that the investigative FBI, which works with Kavanaugh, must change its mind
FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh postponed for a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week. The question arises whether the findings of the bureaus of Republican senators will be able to provide support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Palley asked Republicans Johnny Kennedy and Lindsay Graham about the “Sense”: can the FBI reveal anything that could lead to change.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” said Kennedy.
“I said, going to the court session: I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened and asked him about the reason for the accusation, asking, “Did you do this?”
He was a squirrel and a squirrel.”
Graham's vote, however, seems to be final.
“I think Brett Cavanaugh decided it would be a scandalous accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know it: Brett resolutely denies it,” Graham added, referring to Christina Blaise Ford.
“And everyone she calls couldn’t believe it.
She is only 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the International Festival of Citizens and what is done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York is the International Festival: an annual music event that has a very impressive composition of speakers and performers and has a mission to end poverty in the world.
Now, for seven years, the World Citizenship Festival will take place on a large lawn of Central Park, where tens of thousands of people will come to enjoy the concert of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, as well as learn about the real purpose of the event – to end poverty and poverty by 2030.
The International Citizenship Festival, which appeared in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Project Against the Frustration of an international propaganda group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket for the event (if you do not want to pay a VIP ticket), visitors had to perform a number of tasks or "carry out a promotion", be a volunteer, write an email to the country's leader, call any other figures and raise awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful was the Civil Festival in 12 years and did it achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a costless concert a real way to convince people of the need for active action, or is it just another case of so-called “click” – people feel that they are doing a good job by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the organizers of the festival say that they have recorded more than 19 million "shares" from their fans, who are trying to achieve different goals.
It says these actions have helped push influential leaders to meet their pledges to account for more than $37 billion, which could impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group provided 390 comments on commitments and statements worth at least $10 billion that had already been earmarked or collected.
According to the group, the secured funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include providing food, partnering with investors and contractors based in the UK, “helping children develop fully,” a pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help avoid non-food shortages beyond the UK.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens of different countries, we can eradicate the social injustice of malnutrition in history,” Ambassador Tracy Ullman said in London in April 2018.
In addition, the group reported that after more than 5,000 shares were held, which called for the UK to improve nutrition for moths and children, the government announced funding for a “food aid” project that reaches 5 million women and children with food problems.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the website, “what makes you think that we can end poverty?”
The global festival responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey, sometimes we will suffer defeat and failure.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae – one of a number of personalities who perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be led by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy for a “blockade” to prevent the export of Russian oil and gas
“Washington may, if necessary, appeal to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the EU and Middle East markets,” said Ryan Zink, U.S. Secretary of State, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinc argued that Russia's actions in Syria, in particular where it acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, are the basis for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy just as much as they do in Eastern Europe and southern Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to cope with it.
“The United States has the ability, with the help of the Navy, to ensure the openness of the sea lanes and, if necessary, to organize a blockade so that their energy does not get into the market,” he said.
Zinke appealed to participants of an event organized by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a nonprofit group that positions itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
“The economic alternative to Iran and Russia more or less balances and replaces fuel,” he said, calling Russia a “side country” with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration wants to significantly increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, employees of the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to get out of the “wrong” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline worth 11 billion dollars, which is created to double the power of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's tough opposition to this project is beginning in the economy and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we have a common view that energy cannot be an instrument of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The Americans received a blow in response from Germany, which once again confirmed its commitment to the project.
The main German organization representing industry, the Federation of German Industrialists (BDI) called on the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes in our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrialists' Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is going to discuss her participation in the 2020 presidential election very seriously, says a senator from the state of Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider her participation in the presidential election after the midterm elections.
During a speech at the mayor's office in Halioki, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering taking part.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and order our dysfunctional government, and I’m also talking about women in the highest positions,” she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president."
During the speech in the mayor's office, Warren struck down President Donald Trump, saying that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am extremely concerned about what Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren openly criticized Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, before the vote, you need the FBI to conduct an investigation."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Center for Political Studies of the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe, 58 percent of “possible” Massachusetts voters said that a senator should not run.
Thirty-two percent support her decision.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favour and 48 percent against.
Other well-known names among Democrats that have been debated in connection with a potential 2020 runoff include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would formally make a decision by January.
At a congress in support of Donald Trump, Sarah Palin recalled the post-traumatic syndrome of Track Palin.
Pauline, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted into the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my son is going through after his return, I can compare with the results of the post-traumatic syndrome and the injuries that our soldiers are returning to other families,” she said at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest a "ballistic issue" and said that her son, along with other veterans of the war, "returned a little different, hardened, come back with the question of whether there is the respect for which the soldiers, pilots, other military, gave themselves to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasila, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence against a woman, obstructing an attempt to report domestic violence, carrying a weapon in a drunken state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the police department of Wasila.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new policy on the provision of asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims of gang oppression or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed an analytical note in Washington on Friday to support the disputed asylum policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the claim in Grace v. Sessions, which was opened in August by the American Civil Rights Union against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his hard-core gang friends" raped her, but the U.S. authorities denied her asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers for the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which receive the largest number of requests for asylum in the United States, as countries that have serious problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. policy on asylum has changed the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Commission, which allowed undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence to seek asylum.
Columbia County Attorney General Carl Reisin said on Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislative expertise from states, the country and the world.”
"Federal law requires that applications for asylum be based on specific facts and circumstances of the case, and such a change violates this principle," the analytical note says.
Lawyers also said in a note that a policy that denies immigrants is worsening the U.S. economy, saying that immigrants can often become entrepreneurs and “create the necessary jobs.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give shelter to victims of domestic and gang violence.
“The benefit is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or political views,” Sessions said on June 11, announcing the policy.
A haven has never meant solving problems, even all the serious problems that people face around the world every day.
Desperate rescue work in Pal. While trying to find survivors, doubled the number of deaths
The survivors are in a very difficult situation.
"Everything is very tense," says 35-year-old mother Rice Kusuma, calming his young son with the temperature in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Palu.
"Every minute the car "rapidly" brings bodies.
“The water is very small.”
The inhabitants began to return to their ruined houses, dismantling the wet things, trying to save everything that could be found.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Two Harris, who broke his spine and shoulder, are outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients are treated on the street due to heavy pushes that are repeated.
Tears appeared in his eyes as he recalled the feeling of strong underground pushes in the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to waste.
I was crammed under the ruins of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city to marry.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of “threats” using “propaganda advertising”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper printed a four-page advertisement in the US daily, praising the mutual benefits of US-Chinese trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread the word.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned China Daily's paid appendix in the Des Moines Register – the best-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa – after accusing China of trying to meddle in the November 6 U.S. Congress election. This is China's accusation against the reversal.
Trump's accusation that China tried to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials said in a conversation with Reuters a new phase in Washington's campaign of pressure on China.
Although the placement of advertising by foreign governments is a normal practice to promote trade, now Beijing and Washington have unleashed a trade war that has resulted in reciprocal imposition of tariffs on imports.
Repressive tariffs, U.S. and Chinese experts said, have been imposed to harm exporters such as entrepreneurs from the state of Iowa who support Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
China, wrote Brunstad in a Sunday editorial in the Des Moines Register, “is now doubling its efforts by printing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the good American tradition of free speech and free press by printing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstead wrote.
“And if you look at the newsstands in Beijing, then there you will find not so many votes against and you will not see a real reflection of other opinions that the Chinese may have about the dangerous trajectory in the economy, taking into account the fact that the press is under the iron fifth Communist Party of China.”
He added that "one of China's most influential newspapers has declined an offer" to print his article, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are pushing back women voters ahead of midterm elections from the Cavanaugh fiasco, analysts warn
While many well-known Republicans have defended Supreme Court nominee Breto Cavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned that they will receive a retaliatory blow, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions around this have been very strong, and most Republicans are already showing that they are ready to vote.
"These things can no longer be returned," said Grant Rychar, a professor of political science at Maxwell Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article that was published on Saturday.
Rihar said he was not sure Senator Jeff Flake's (Arizona) statements about the FBI's investigation would be enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and national press secretary of the Progressive Group MoveOn newspaper from Washington, D.C., on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November fast!" during a demonstration in the Senate hall, when the Republicans, who control the legal committee, decided to nominate Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite a statement from Dr. Christina Blaise Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be enormous," Stu Rottenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news site.
“People say that they are already high, and that’s true.
But they can be even higher, especially among women voters in suburbs and young voters from 18 to 29 years old, who do not like the president, but often do not vote."
Even before Ford's open statement, in which she detailed her accusations of a candidate in the Supreme Court of sexual violence, analysts suggest that if Republicans insist on confirmations, there may be a strong blow in response.
“For the Republican Party, this has become a bit of a mix,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican Party’s National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or about the final vote, or about whether to get Kavanaugh to the post. It's about how the Republicans coped with it and how they treated her," noted news channel Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, which helps the group.
However, it seems that the Americans are divided on the issue of the right Ford or Cavanaugh, and a little more stands for the latter.
A new survey from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents are confidently or not very confidently trusting Ford's statement, and 35 percent said they are confidently or not very confidently trusting Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his statement, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After a push from Flake, the FBI investigates allegations from Ford and at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford made a statement under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavanaugh, when he was drunk, sought her out at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals at a party when they were studying at Eile in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is launching a startup that will become a competitor to Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that is built on the open platform of Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the location of the data storage and who has permission to access this information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that, by creating Inrupt, he meant "control of the world".
“You have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create “own repositories of data on the Internet” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, fanatic and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser at a time.
The uniqueness of the personal data repository on the Internet is that only the user determines who has access to which type of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment with data.”
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea of creating Inrupt gives the company the opportunity to bring together the resources, process, and necessary skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers working on the contract project, and volunteer hairdressers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized programs using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Brenners-Lee said he and his team had not spoken to Facebook and Google about whether or not to make full changes if all of their business models were immediately reviewed.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission “is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been very influential in favor of net neutrality.
Even by launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the new age of the web,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Honoring the Priest Awarded by the Victoria Cross in World War I
The only priest of the Anglican Church, awarded by the Victoria Cross during World War I as a participant in the fighting, was celebrated in his city 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Van was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack at Belenglis and Leacourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper's bullet and never found out that he had received the highest British military award.
On Saturday, two of his grandsons unveiled a memorial in the town of Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Wang, said it was “very symbolic” that the stone opens exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lt. Col. Wang led his battalion through the Canal de San Quentin "through a dense fog and under strong gun and machine gun fire of the enemy."
Then he ran to the line of fire and "with great courage" led the soldier forward, independently seizing the gun and knocking out three units.
Lieutenant-Colonel Wang was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, and just over a month later the war ended.
The 72-year-old Michael Wang said his grandfather's actions were "something I would never have been able to do and also something worthy of respect."
He and his brother Dr. James Wang also laid the wreath after a council led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra of Brantwood.
Michael Wang said that "it is a great honor for him to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero has been demonstrated by the support that many have shown."
MMA fans waited all night to watch the Bellator 206, they got Pep's piggyback instead
Just imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the packaged transmission from Bellator 206, and then you are denied to watch the main event.
The program from San Jose had 13 fights, including six on the main map, and they were shown live all night on the British channel Channel 5.
And at six o'clock in the morning, when Gerard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the battle, the viewers in the UK were just astonished when the program changed to Pep's piggyback.
Some were disappointed after spending a sleepless night, specially waiting for this fight.
One of the cheerleaders on Twitter called the switch to a children's cartoon as "someone's stupid joke".
In response to a question about the broadcast, Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president for marketing and communications, said: “According to the state decree at 6 a.m. this content was inappropriate and needed to be switched to a children’s program.”
"Yes, Pep's Pig."
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they would work on a program in the future to take into account British viewers.
“I believe we’re going to discuss the possibility of a recurrence, in my opinion, we can solve this issue,” Cocker said.
"But now it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't solve this until Sunday in our time, and this is Monday in their time.
But we are doing our best.
Believe me, when the programs changed, we received a lot of messages and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to solve the problem by thinking that it was a technical error.
But it turned out to be a government decision.
I can promise you this won't happen next time.
We will reduce the number of fights from six to five, as we usually do, this time we wanted to please the fans, but we overreached.
It's a bad situation."
"Disk of an uninhabited island": Tom Daley felt "minor" because of sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley said he grew up feeling insignificant to others because of his sexuality – but that gave him motivation on the road to success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t understand that “not everyone is like me” until he went to high school.
Speaking on Radio 4's "Disk of an Uninhabited Island" program in leading Laurent Laverne, he said he supports gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that when he had a child, he began to think less about winning the Olympics.
The traditional host of this rather old Kirsty Young program, took a break for several months because of the disease.
In the role of the man who found himself on a deserted island, on the first program of Laverne, Daley said that as a child he felt "less" than all the others, because "the public did not accept those who liked both boys and girls."
He said, “I still believe that this feeling of being different and insignificant was what gave me the strength and inspiration to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so as not to disappoint those who learned about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze medalist of the Olympics has become a significant LGBT activist and at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on the country not to criminalize homosexuals.
He said that he expressed his opinion, because he was lucky to live openly, without persecution and wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said that when he fell in love with a man – American screenwriter, director and producer Dostine Lance Blacke, whom he met in 2013 – “it was unexpected for me.”
Daly married the Oscar-winning actor, who is 20 years his senior, last year, but he said the age difference didn't matter.
“If you’re going through this at such a young age,” he said at the first Olympics when he was 14 years old, and three years later his father died of cancer, he said it was hard to find a peer who would survive such ups and downs.
In June, they became parents, their son's name was Robert Ray Black-Daly, and Daley said his "prospects have completely" changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would tell you that I need to win a gold medal,” he said.
“You know, there are things in the world that are more important than the Olympic gold medal.
“Robi is my Olympic gold medal.”
His son is also called as his father – Robert. His father died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept the fact that he would die and one of the last things he asked about was whether they bought tickets for the 2012 London Olympics – he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to sit in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he stopped breathing and died did I finally realize that he was not immortal,” he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that’s what I’ve been dreaming about all my life – jumping into the water in front of my cheerleaders at the Olympics, it’s the best feeling,” he said.
It also influenced the selection of the song – Proud by Heather Small – which found in it a response in preparation for the Olympics and from which the ants are still running.
"Disk of the Uninhabited Island" can be listened to on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 UK summer time.
Michelson, who is not in shape, remains on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Michelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he needs to get back in shape so that the event doesn't become unlucky.
Michelson, who will play in this competition, which is held every two years, a record 12 times, team captain Jim Furrick put on a bench of spares for Saturday's forballs.
Instead of being at the center of events, and he was there often for the United States team, the five-time cup winner divided his days between cheerleading and training, hoping to get back in shape.
Even at the height of his career, he was not the best player, and now the 48-year-old golfer is not an ideal choice for the difficult Le Golf National field, where inaccurate strikes are severely punished.
And if the field itself is not somber enough, Michelson in the ninth match on Sunday will fight against the exact champion of the British Open Francesco Malinara, who along with Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind at the beginning of 12 singles matches, start with success, the match of Michelson can be extremely important.
Fuhrer expressed confidence in this player, but could not say anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He’s very self-confident.
He was accepted into the Hall of Fame and gave a lot of teams last and this week.
Maybe I didn't plan on playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's how it worked, and that's how we thought we'd play.
He wants to be in the field, just like everyone else.”
Michelson will beat Nick Fald's record for the number of Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup, which has never been the same as achievements in individual games.
Michelson had 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence had benefited the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, humorous, likes to joke about people and just a very good person to have on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players were happy to pare his jokes, also this week, and it was good to see.
It gives the team a lot more than just a game."
European team captain Thomas Byrne knows that a big gap could soon disappear.
Thomas Byrne, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant gap before the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can easily disappear.
The Danish player made his debut in the 1997 match in Walderm, where the European team led by Sevo Balesters had a five-point lead over the Americans, but finished with a minimum lead of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You constantly remind yourself that at Walderma we had a great advantage and won, but with difficulty, we had a great advantage in Brooklyn where we lost,” Bjorn said after watching how the National Class of 2018 team won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday, and led with the number 10-6.
“History shows me and everyone else in the team that this is not the end.
We'll have to play 100 tomorrow.
Get on the field and do the right thing.
As long as it's on the table, nothing is over.
We have a goal and this is an attempt to win this trophy, this is what we will focus on.
I keep saying this, I focus on 12 players on our side, but we understand very well that there are the best players in the world on the opposite side.”
Satisfied with the way his players played on the heavy golf course, Bjorn added, "I will never overestimate myself in this.
Tomorrow will be a different game.
Tomorrow will be a different game, and that's different.
It's just great when you're on the field with your partner and everything is going well, but when you play alone, then your real talents as a golfer come true.
Here's what you need to tell the players that they have to show the best tomorrow.
Now we need to leave the partner, we need to go and also show all the best as an individual player."
Unlike Bjorn, his rival Jim Furyk hopes for a better individual match for his athletes than the one they demonstrated in the partnership, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both sides of these last-day matches, playing in the winning team in Brooklyn and losing when Europe had "The Miracle in Medina."
"I remember every word of this," he said, answering a question as Ben Cranshaw, the captain of 1999 tuned his players to the last day.
“Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but always want to have a quick start, which you saw in Brooklyn and in Medina.
When the speed increases, the greatest pressure is on those who play matches in the middle.
We made the appropriate schedule and put the players as we liked. You know, tomorrow we're trying to get a little magic."
Thomas was tasked with starting to play back and playing against Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter will play against top golfers.
“I put my players in that order because I think I’m going to close everything down like that,” Bjorn said of his choice for individual matches.
The downing of the new German warship has been postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy was supposed to enter service in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but it will appear no earlier than next year due to faulty systems and constantly increasing prices, according to local media reports.
The descent of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the brand new class of frigates Baden-Wuerttemberg, was postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoting the military representative.
The ship was supposed to enter service in 2014, but the problems that emerged after the construction hampered this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class warships, ordered back in 2007, are to replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
They will be armed with powerful guns, various anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some "stealth" technologies, for example, reduced visibility for radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Among other important characteristics – longer periods between maintenance – newer frigates may not enter their ports until two years.
However, the constant delays mean that modern battleships – which could allow Germany to demonstrate its power outside the country – will become obsolete until they finally enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media wrote about many "defects in software and equipment" that make the ship useless in a combat mission.
The disadvantages of the software were particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have only 120 sailors – half the crew of the old Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship has a very high weight, which reduces its performance and limits the possibility of further upgrades.
"Rheinland-Pfalz" weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice the weight of ships of this class, which was used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the price of the entire project – including crew training – is also becoming a problem.
The price reached an incredible 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – although initially it was 2.2 billion euros.
The problems that are accumulating with the new frigates are becoming especially important in light of recent warnings that Germany's maritime power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defense committee in the German parliament, said the Navy “has fewer ships capable of military missions.”
He said that the problem with time increases, because the old ships are written off, and there are no replacement ships.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Society for the Protection of Monuments has listened to the secret life of bats
A new study, conducted in the Scottish Highlands, aims to identify how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
Scientists hope to find something new in the behavior of unique flying mammals and help in future actions to preserve these animals.
A study by scientists of the National Society for the Conservation of Monuments of Scotland deals with small bats and also the brown long-tailed bats of Dabanton in the gardens of Inverrieu in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be located in the main locations of this area to monitor the actions of bats during the season.
Social workers and volunteers will conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
An expert analysis of the sounds of all records determines the frequency of bat calls, as well as what bats do.
A residence map and report will be used to create a detailed picture of the behavior of these animals in this landscape.
Rob Dewar, an advisor to the National Conservation Society, hopes the results will show which areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of creating habitats such as meadows, and how to maintain forests for bats and other related animals.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the place of residence and destroy them.
Wind turbines and lighting can be a risk, as well as sticky tapes for flies and some chemicals for building materials. They are also threatened by domestic cats.
The horses aren't blind.
However, due to their nightlife, bat ears are more sensitive than the eyes when it comes to hunting.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect bugs and obstacles along the way.
The National Society, which is responsible for more than 270 buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, residential check-ups and, sometimes, rescue activities.
The organization even created the first and only Scottish bat reserve in the Triv estate in Dumfries and Glavey, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The head of the estate, David Thompson, says that this is an ideal area for bats.
"Here, in Triv, we just have a great place for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and a very good place to live.
But we don’t know much about bats yet, so our work here and in other estates will help us to better understand what they need for a better life.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out repairs to property, since it is possible to unintentionally destroy one seat, killing up to 400 females and young bats, which will lead to the complete destruction of the local population.
Bats are under protection and are prohibited from killing, scaring, disturbing or destroying their seats.
Elizabeth Farall, an employee of the Flea Protection Organization in Scotland, is urging the public to help in this matter.
She says, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and about many of the species we don't even know how their populations live."
Ronaldo is accused of rape and his lawyers are going to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo called his accusations of rape "fake news", saying people wanted to "advertise themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published these accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus national team forward was accused of raping American Catherine Mayorga in the Atelier Room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Then he seemed to pay her $375,000 for silence, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
In an Instagram Live video, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his followers hours after the charges were posted, calling the post “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today's messages are fake news," said the five-time owner of the Golden Ball in front of the camera.
"They want to make an advertisement in my name.
That's okay.
They want to be known by mentioning my name, but that's part of my job.
I am a happy and good person,” he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case in court against the magazine Der Spiegel on the issue of accusations, which they called "inadmissible message about suspicions in a private case," reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Scherz said the player would claim compensation for “moral damage in an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation of rights, and in recent years this is perhaps the most serious violation of personal rights.”
It was as if the incident took place in June 2009 in the suite room of the Palms Hovetel and Casinos in Las Vegas.
Meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorgo seemed to return to the footballer's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, as written in the documents of the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after that Ronaldo knelt down and said that at "99 percent" he is a "good guy" who suffers from "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo admitted that they had had sex, but with the consent of the parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took pictures of the injuries in the hospital, but then agreed to an extrajudicial settlement, because she was "very afraid of revenge" and worried that she was "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she wants to reinstate the charge now because she feels a moral injury for the case.
At the time, as if this case had taken place, Ronaldo was going to move to Real Madrid with Manchester United, and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus, closing a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK will “forever regret” the loss of carmakers
The UK “will forever regret” if it loses its status as the world leader in automotive after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that he was "disturbed" by Toyota UK's statement to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement, the company will temporarily cut production at the plant in Bernaston, near Derby in half.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border as a result of Brexit without a deal could lead to job cuts.
The plant in Bernaston – where Toyota Auris and Avensis are made – last year produced almost 150,000 cars, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s director in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in the UK have raised the question of how cross-border trade will be carried out if Britain leaves the EU without an agreement. Among them are Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concern is that carmakers are talking about the risk of supply chains as a result of Brexit without an agreement.
Toyota's production line operates on an "exactly on time" basis, with spare parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers both in the UK and in the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border that will lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It will be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's supply of parts at the Derby plant, the company said, so production will stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “made precisely to avoid these checks at the border.”
“We need an agreement. We want to get the best agreement that will allow not only today’s success, but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity,” he said in the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“The information we receive not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers suggests that we should be able to continue to operate successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long the production would not work, but warned in the future that the added cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and lead to a reduction in jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, who has been working at Bernaston for 24 years and is the trade union coordinator, said that trade union members are very concerned: "In my experience, if jobs are cut, they will not be renewed.
The government’s spokesman said: “We have offered an accurate plan for our future relationship with the EU that is trustworthy.”
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again
A very important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week,” while the fight around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a White House spokesman said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is studying election interference by Russia, Trump's aides' ties to Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump fires the assistant attorney general or not, and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence, he has been pouring oil on Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of taking a hidden microphone to record conversations with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president from office with the help of the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein has refuted this.
But on Monday, he went to the White House amid rumors that he was about to step down.
Instead, it was announced that there would be a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he “wouldn’t want” to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid a quarrel at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Cavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, spoke.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the statement against Kavanaugh, which further slowed the Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date is not yet scheduled, maybe this week, maybe next week. I believe that, rather, a week later, takes into account all the other things that take place in the Supreme Court case.
But everything will happen, and I always give the press the latest information."
Some journalists are willing to deny her claim: Sanders has not held press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the host of the program, asked her why.
Sanders said the rarity of briefings is caused by no contempt for TV reporters who “work for the public,” although she added, “I agree with the fact that they work for the public.”
She said that Trump's direct contact with the press would increase.
“The president holds more meetings with answers to press questions than any president who has been before him,” she said, adding without specific facts: “We’ve studied these numbers.”
Briefings are taking place, Sanders said, but “if the press has a chance to directly ask questions to the president of the United States, it’s much better than doing it through me.
We try to do this often, you have seen how we have done it in the last few weeks. Such meetings, at which you can ask a question directly to the president, replace briefings.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends meetings on the street, or at press conferences with high-profile foreign guests.
The president's own press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why, when freely and sometimes extravagantly appeared in front of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to workers from EU countries in the health system of Scotland before Brexit
The health minister wrote to EU workers working in Scotland's health care system to express their gratitude on behalf of the country and to wish them to remain after Brexit.
Jen Freeman sent a letter less than six months before Britain's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government is already ready to cover the cost of applications for residence from EU citizens working in the public services of the country.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of our country have continued. They lead to the expected decisions this fall.
But the British government also rushed to prepare for a no-deal scenario.
I know this is a very stressful time for all of you.
So I want to remind you how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from all EU countries, and not only, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, also benefit patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay with us.”
Christian Abercrombie underwent surgery after a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers team linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone an urgent surgery after getting a head injury in Sunday's match, which his team lost to the 31-27 Vanderbilt Commodores team, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reid told reporters that the player suffered injury shortly before the break.
“He switched to the side line and suddenly fell,” Reid said.
Coaches and medics gave Abercombe oxygen still on the field before putting it on the harness and transferring it to make a diagnosis.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV radio station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is “no information about what kind of injury it was,” and Tennessee State is trying to identify when a player has received an injury.
Abercomby, a fellow athlete, spends his first season for Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he made five complete intercepts, giving him only 18 intercepts per season.
Foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee
According to the new plan of conservatives, foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher fee, and additional money will go to help the homeless
This action neutralizes the success of Corbyn's initiative to attract young voters
The increase in the state tax will affect those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance plans to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May has announced that foreign buyers of British real estate will pay a higher state tax and additional money will go to help the homeless.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative by attracting young voters, as well as providing affordable housing. It is aimed at people with high incomes.
The increase in the state tax is aimed at individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money received will go to the government's housing program for the homeless.
The increase in the current state duty, including the higher levels adopted two years ago, for the purchase of second homes and housing for hire, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
About 13 percent of new buildings in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, this leads to higher prices and new buyers find it difficult to buy their first home.
Many rich regions of the country – especially the capital – have become “ghost cities”, because a large number of buyers from abroad most of the time live outside the UK.
The new policy came just weeks after Boris Johnson's call for a reduction in the state's levy on young buyers to facilitate the purchase of the first home.
He accused major construction firms of maintaining high real estate prices by seizing land and not using it, and called on Ms May to lift quotas for affordable housing to address the “shameful housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a vocal series of housing reforms, including rent control and an end to “unfounded” evictions.
He also wants to give the local council more authority in the field of housing construction.
Mrs May said: “Last year I announced that I would dedicate my job as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – life for every new generation should be made better.
This means that we are improving the quality of our home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not reside in the UK and foreign companies can buy real estate as easily as working people in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of having their own home is becoming increasingly unattainable, and the problem of the homeless remains very real."
Jack Ross: “My main ambition is to manage the Scottish national team”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross said his main ambition was to one day become a coach of the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is performing the task of restoring the club from the northeast, which is now in third place of the First League, three points from the first.
He switched to this job in the summer, after returning to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
But it didn't work out," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“I grew up, often ill for Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and something always made me come back.
However, such an opportunity will arise when I am a successful club coach."
Among Ross' predecessors are Sunderland coach Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poye and Paul di Ca<0xC3><0xB1>a.
Former coach of "Aloa Athletic" says that he did not feel fear of such famous names at such a large club, having previously rejected offers from "Barnsley" and "Ipswich Town".
“The answer to the question, ‘Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?’
According to the structure and material base of the club, his place is probably in the Premier League," he said.
“Not just bring him back there, but I will consider my work to be successful only if I can bring the club back there.”
Ross only worked as a coach for three years, before that he was assistant coach at "Dumbarton" and for 15 months worked at the coaching staff of "Harts".
He then helped Aloe come back from the third league and turned Saint-Mirren from a loser who almost made it to the Championship to the winner of the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than during his player career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Saint-Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Recalling working at Aloe, he said, “It was a really important choice.”
“I really believed that coaching was what I needed, even more than a game.
Sounds amazing, because I worked well, earned well and reached certain heights.
But the game can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do every week.
I'm still going through this when it comes to stress and pressure, but coaching is what it takes.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, and for me it’s the best time of my adult life.”

The hot summer has boosted the profits of British pubs struggling to survive, but has brought pressure on restaurant chains.
According to statistics, the group of pubs and bars noted an increase in sales by 2.7 percent in July, but in restaurants the sales volume decreased by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Advisory Business Group, which collected this statistic, said: "Longer sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of the English national team in the World Cup final, means that in July, what happened in June, when sales increased.
The decline in sales in restaurants by 1.8 percent in June, only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly sell drinks have so far shown the best result as opposed to restaurants.
The pubs that sell more food are also sunburned in the sun, although not as strong as the restaurants.
People just seem to want to drink.
In pubs and bars, sales of beverages increased by 6.6 percent, and sales of food decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, RSM’s recreation and accommodation analyst, said: “These results are becoming the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social and sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales volumes in the public food market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to struggle, as sales fell by 4.8 percent per year, and it is very unpleasant when prices are constantly rising.
The long and hot summer has come at the worst time for operators who focus on food, and the time will show whether the lower temperatures in August will bring such expected relief."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, a sales tracking tool in British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 active groups that have a total turnover of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an important benchmark in this industry.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The study found that one in five children – some of whom turned just 11 – have secret social media accounts that hide them from parents and teachers.
Study of 20,000 high school students showed the growth of "fake Insta" pages
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "major" account that showed parents
One in five children—some as young as 11—create accounts on social media that they keep secret from their parents.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth of “fake Insta” accounts – which seem to lead to an Instagram photo sharing site.
The news has fueled fears that sexual content is being published there.
Twenty percent of students said they kept “clean” “basic” accounts to show their parents, and also kept private accounts.
One mother, who accidentally found the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter, learned that she called on others to “rape me”.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent School Directors' Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is very worrying that so many teenagers want to create places on the Internet where neither parents nor teachers can find them.”
Eilid Doyle will be the “voice of athletes” in the Scottish Council of Athletics
Eylid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as a supervisory board member at the body's annual general meeting.
Doyle, Scotland’s most titled athlete and chairman, Ian Beatty, described the event as a great opportunity for those who drive the sport to benefit from her experience at a wide variety of levels, including international over the past decade.
“Eilede has great respect in Scotland, the UK and the global sports community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit a lot from her work in the Council,” said Beatty.
Doyle said: "I want to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to help drive the sport in Scotland."
An American who won gold in the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and two other gold medals at the other Olympics, and who now works as an expert at the BBC, cannot walk after suffering a stroke.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell whether I will recover and to what extent.
It was hard work, but I've recovered completely, I've learned to walk again and now I'm doing exercises for aging!
Thank you for your support!”
The advertising of the milk pump, where mothers are compared with cows, shared opinions on the Internet
A dairy pump company has shared opinions by releasing an ad that compares nursing women to nursing cows.
To mark the launch of what is called the “world’s first worn milk pump,” consumer company Elvie has released Iranian music advertising based on video to show the freedom this device gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a squirrel with cows to a song where there are these words: "Yes, I give myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not a udder, it's my breast."
And he said, “Dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai, dai.”
However, the advertisement, which was placed on the Facebook page of the company, caused a heated discussion on the Internet.
77 000 views and hundreds of comments. The reaction to the video was ambiguous, many said that this is the horror of dairy production.
"It's a very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should get pregnant and give birth to give milk, only their children are selected in a few days," one viewer wrote.
Elvie's milk pump is imperceptibly hidden in the feeding bras (Elvie/Mother)
He said: “It’s very difficult for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them to advertise milk pumps for mothers who do not take away their children?"
He added: “It’s such a bad idea.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that she considered the song "fun".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd love to have one if I had breasts.
The suction of the milk makes me feel like a corpse.
It's a bit crazy, but I liked it.
It’s a brilliant product,” she wrote.
Another comment: "A very entertaining advertisement aimed at mothers who suck milk with a pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and hear themselves as "cows".
This ad does not applaud or condemn the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they all danced with invisible milk pumps hidden in bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the fact that many women who use milk pumps feel cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely noiseless, has no wires or pipes and imperceptibly hides in the bras for nursing women, gives women freedom of movement, allows you to keep children and even leave the house while the device is running.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director of Mother, noted: “Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a clear and provocative launch.
Drawing a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the suction of milk and its difficulties, while at the same time demonstrating in a fun and gentle way how the new milk pump will bring extraordinary freedom of movement.
It's not the first time that Elaine has been in the spotlight.
During the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the catwalk dressed by Marta Jakubowski, using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being transported to a tent camp on the Texas border without too much noise.
Although the number of border crossings per month has barely changed, the number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, in part due to the harsh rhetoric and policies carried out by the Trump administration, which have made it more difficult to accommodate children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most of the sponsors are illegal immigrants who are afraid to jeopardize their own stay in the country, taking responsibility for the child.
The risks increased significantly in June, when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of households will need to submit fingerprints and data will be transferred to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior immigration and customs officer, made a report to Congress on the arrests of dozens of people who had asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
Later, the agency reported that 70% of those arrested had no previous convictions.
“About 80 percent of people who are sponsors or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a significant part of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That’s why we continue to persecute such people,” said Mr. Albens.
To speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month from the date of detention, and, according to shelter workers, the previously standard period was 60 days.
A large number of people to apply for their own legal status, the immigration judge will have to use video communication, and not be present in court in person.
Those who are not considered to have a basis for providing assistance will be quickly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from sources in the system that have emerged in recent months, the longer children remain incarcerated, the higher the likelihood of depression or increased anxiety, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted escapes.
Lawyers say that in larger institutions, such as Turniglia, these problems are much stronger, as signs that the child is in a poor state are more likely to be ignored due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to a tent town without providing time for emotional training or to say goodbye to friends can aggravate the trauma that many have already faced.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of “occupation forces” of the United States, France and Turkey
In an address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home despite a war that has been raging in the country for eight years.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are on Syrian soil illegally, on the basis of counter-terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly.”
"They should leave immediately and not put any conditions," he said at the Assembly meeting.
Muallem insisted that in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions of people have had to abandon their homes, “the war on terrorism is almost over.”
He said Damascus intends to continue “lead this holy battle until we have cleared all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
About 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mostly serving as instructors and advisers to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France's land contingent in this war-torn country is more than 1,000 troops.
On the issue of refugees, Muallem said the conditions for return were favorable and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that hold refugees abroad.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
“They’re politicizing a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone in Idlib's last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "precise terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including militants from the al-Qaida-linked Nusra front, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee in the near future, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Muallem expressed the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the commission should be limited "by reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warnings against interference.
Why Trump is going to the next term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election if, as many liberal viewers hope, impeachment and scandal do not end his presidency in a timely manner.
And this, without a doubt, will be the most dramatic finale of the presidency in all history!
At the moment, there is no sign of fatigue.
Since 2014, the rankings in the prime time have more than doubled – to 1.05 million on CNN and almost three times – to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, in Fox News an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the program "The Rachel Maddow Show" channel MSNBC gathered by the screen 3.5 million viewers and surpassed the ratings of cable TV in the evening, before the gala.
“It’s a fire that people are drawn to because we don’t understand it,” says Neil Barr, director of ABC’s drama The Reaper, about a member of the Cabinet who becomes president after an attack that destroyed the Capitol.
In Nelly Scawell, a masquerading comedian and author of the book “A Couple of Funny Details and a Few Hard Truths About Penetrating the Club of Hollywood Boys,” there is another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston ahead of the 2016 election.
He told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
- Why? - asked Jane.
He replied, “Because he amuses me,” Miss Scowell told me.
Chaos is something that can be enjoyed.
Of course, unlike all the rest of television, the storylines coming out of Washington may be just as defining the future as the case of the “Rue vs. Wade”, it depends on whether the immigrant family will be able to reunite and healthy the world.
Ignorance is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, if you watch the sixth hour of Trump's speech, the group of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward's "not for print" in the book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket for $15,000 with ostrich skin (clothing sewn with pride, as the Washington Post and the Washington Post reported).
I don't think I'll ever look at Super Mario as much as I did before.
"Part of what he does, makes you feel like you're watching a reality show he's showing every night," says Brenth Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of Pawn Stars on a reversible action show.
You can't afford to miss even one episode, otherwise you'll be out of the trend.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside the windows of his house on the north bank of Kauai stood a hot sunny day and 30 degrees of heat, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC while he was recording to CNN.
It couldn't have happened, not when Brett Cavanaugh appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, discussing the future of the Supreme Court hanging on its hair.
“I remember the girls when we were putting out these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleis told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out that they were right.”

Foreign cash flows are pouring into the fierce pre-election race of the midterm elections to the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th constituency was flooded with cash thanks to a change in the boundaries of the constituencies introduced by Congress, which is why two candidates participate in elections for one seat.
The recently remodeled suburban area of Pittsburgh is surrounded by a Democrat, member of the House of Representatives Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in the pre-election last spring.
Lamb is opposed by another sitting MP, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th.
The maps were repainted after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the votes of the old districts were unconstitutionally counted in favor of the Republicans.
The election race in the new 17th district caused a decline in the company's financing by the financial groups of the main parties, the Committee of the Congress of the Democratic Company (CCDC) and the National Committee of the Republican Company (NCRC).
Lamb became well-known in Pennsylvania after a difficult victory in the widely contested midterm elections in Pennsylvania's 18th arrondissement in March.
The seat has been held by the Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a gap of 20 points.
Political experts have a slight preference for Democrats.
The U.S. praised El Salvador for its support of China and then backed down.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already supported Beijing's position, despite slight opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and settled in a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted Trump's leadership team.
State Department representatives have decided to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama in connection with “recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would hurt a Central American country with its high levels of unemployment and homicide.
As the internal meetings ended, representatives of North and Central America postponed the holding of a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which would have been a continuation of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the efforts of the previous year.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and effectively halted consideration of El Salvador's punishment.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which is scheduled for mid-October, in a sign that the administration is in favor of holding the event.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss domestic issues on condition of anonymity.
Their reports are confirmed by other close to the administration analysts, who also wished to remain anonymous.
Let's learn the story
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, examples of which are currently very hard evidence in public documents.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller drew attention in the investigation to the possibility of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia in an attack on the elections.
If Congress changes the host, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just as he is preparing to speak again to voters, and possibly ultimately to a jury of his colleagues.
There’s a lot of “when,” and I don’t mean to say that Mr. Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like the fall of Mr. Trump in Europe.
All of us, on both sides of the Atlantic, must make a choice that determines how long the struggle will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West had resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the next years of bloodshed.
History revolves around such turning points, and the implacable march of democracy is accelerated or postponed.
The U.S. is currently facing a number of these challenges.
What will happen if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since the newspaper wrote that last year he offered to secretly write down the words of the president and pondered his profaneness.
Mr. Rosenstein says the retelling by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation into the Bret Cowan case is not comprehensive or fair, or if it is approved by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual violence and dishonest testimony?
And first of all, will we vote in the elections for the Congress, which will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these tests, there will be a long winter for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the lessons I've learned in the past.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy house.
She survived, immigrated to America, and after 60 years she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on this table with a swastika.
How can I not be an optimist in relation to our future?”

Graham Dorance of the Rangers are optimistic about the eve of the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers are taking Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians after an impressive draw in Spain over Villarreal earlier this month will allow them to confidently withdraw from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorance from playing for the first time in the season before a 2–2 draw with Villarreal, however, he believes that the Rangers will be able to take advantage of this result as a springboard.
“It was an important match for us, because Villarreal is a strong opponent,” – says the 31-year-old footballer.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and earned a point.
Maybe we could have scored the ball in the end, but in general, it was also a good result.
They looked better in the first half, but in the second half we took each other in hand, and we had the best half of the field.
On Thursday, there will be another important night for European football.
I hope we can earn three points, but it will be a difficult game, as they showed a good result in the last game, but given the crowd of fans on the stands, I am sure that we will be able to overcome them and show a good game.
"Last year was definitely tough, both because of my injuries and the change in the club itself, but now we have a factor of confidence.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy the game; the workouts are productive.
I hope that we can move forward, surpass the result of last season and achieve success."
Women are losing sleep due to fear of retirement.
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of what care they wanted for themselves, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study reported talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not taking steps to discuss it,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's where to start.
Discuss this with your husband and children: your family will not be ready to help you if you do not voice your wishes in advance.
Work with a counselor and family and discuss where and how to get medical care, as this choice can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Get involved in the discussion of a financial advisor. it can also help find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy that will help cover these costs, or you can insure your own life – provided you have the money.
Resolve cases with legal documents: foresee the battles of the courts.
Get the trust of the medical service to appoint a trusted person to control your medical service and ensure the compliance of specialists with your wishes in case you are unable to speak.
In addition, consider the possibility of issuing trust on financial management.
Appoint a trusted person to make financial decisions and secure the payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Do not forget about the details: imagine that your elderly father needs immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about medications and the presence of allergies?
Write down these details in writing to be ready.
“Not only financial issues play a role, but also the professionalism of doctors,” adds Martin.
“What kind of medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
You have to plan.”
In Ilfrakomba, a man was shot several times with a pneumatic rifle

Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disconnection, humanitarian aid officials were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city celebrated the 40th anniversary of its foundation.
Dongala is a regency that stretches along more than 180 miles (300 km) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The Regency is an administrative unit with a status lower than the province, in 2017 there were 299,200 people.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important for the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravia, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times in the past 100 years by a tsunami.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by the tsunami in Dongala, and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Dongala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is in the seismic-active Pacific Ring of Fire and its regularly rocked earthquakes.
The following is a list of major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A severe earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the entire Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March-early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Niyasa, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: In the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 occurred.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred on one of the islands of Mentawa outside Sumatra, causing a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake struck the Pizi Jaya Regency in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time the tsunami did not come, but more than 100 people died under the ruins of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit Indonesia's tourist island of Lambok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists unable to leave.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Vasila, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, which contradicted information about domestic violence and opposition to the arrest, published on Saturday by the police of the state of Alaska.
According to a police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he took away her phone.
According to the channel "KTUU", Palin is in the following insulator Matanuska-Susitno under a pledge of $ 500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "precisely innocent" when asked if he pleaded guilty, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three class-A offences, for which he faces up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with committing a class B crime, which is punishable by a day's imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Pauline has been indicted.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to talk about the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a state of alcohol intoxication in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans' groups in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic syndrome caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia, tsunami: hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are not working, and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The quake occurred near central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the timing of the attack.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
The federal prosecutor's office requires a rare death sentence for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is seeking the death penalty for Saiful Saipov, a suspected terrorist in New York City who killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for federal crimes since 1953.
Saipov, 30 years old, in October allegedly used a rented truck of the company "Home Depot" for a ride on a bicycle track along the West Side chassis in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
To substantiate the death sentence, according to the announcement of the intention to achieve the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" shot eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious injuries.
According to the court materials, for both offences, a death penalty is possible.
A few weeks after the attack, a large federal investigation jury stunned Saipov by filing charges of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in support of the racketeering; this item is commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as prosecutions.
According to prosecutors, the attack required "careful and deliberate planning", and describing the crimes committed by Saipov, used such phrases as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Saiful Habibulaevich Saipov caused injuries, inflicted damage and caused losses to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ana-Laura Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Feruch, Ern<0xC3><0xA1>n D<0xC3><0xBA>n D<0xC3><0xAD>nego
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last criminal case was opened with the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last federal death penalty in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been sentenced two years earlier for conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
A pair of Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek national, according to court documents, demonstrated a lack of conscientious objections in the days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said that he was pleased with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack by watching a video of the Islamic State on his phone.
He also asked for permission to lift the Islamic State flag in the hospital palace, police said.
He did not plead guilty to a 22-point indictment.
David Patan, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were “definitely disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, not about life imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only prolong the pain of these events for all participants,” said Patan.
In the past, the defense team of Saipova has asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Today, during a protest at the Torah party conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians should “feel uncomfortable” with the eurosceptics – as one of the MPs, Theresa May, offered his candidacy for talks with the EU.
Peter Bone, a member of parliament from the Conservative Party, said during a march in Birmingham that the UK would have already “exited” if Mr Farage had held the post of secretary of state for Brexit.
But the problem faced by Mrs May, trying to reconcile her disparate supporters, got even worse when the Tories, who are in favor of maintaining EU membership, staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is working hard to keep the compromise Chequers Agreement under constant pressure from supporters and opponents of the exit, as well as from the EU itself.
Allies insist on continuing their attempts to make a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and want to force Euroskeptics and Labour to choose between its package and “disorder”.
Mr. Bone said at a rally in Salihala "Leave Means Leave" that he wants to "throw the Checker off the board".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made equal and that the responsibilities for negotiations with Brussels should be laid down.
"If he was responsible, we would have already left," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I'm for Brexit, but we need to move away from the Checker plan."
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We did not wage world wars to be dependent.
We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone dismissed the suggestion that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay is completely out of line with reality.”
A supporter of Brexit and member of the Torah, Andrea Jenkins was also on the march, and in a conversation with journalists said: "I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular in our party and the activists who are actually taking to the streets and electing us.
Please drop the plan and start listening.”
In a sharp address to Ms May, she added: “Prime Ministers remain in office if they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians need to be made to “feel uncomfortable” if they are going to betray the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
“This is a matter of trust between us – the people and the politicians,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘This isn’t going to get out of hand.’”
In his address to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make those of our politicians who are willing to betray Brexit feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the people’s army of this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the Exodus marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners of Tories Against Brexit (Tory vs. Brexit) after the group launched this weekend.
Labour's peer, Lord Adanis, scolded the Conservatives for the security challenges they faced because of the party program at the opening of the conference.
“These are people who are telling us that they can have ready to use IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus, for friction-free borders, for borderless free trade in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to pay close attention to the process of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “pay close attention to the process of running for president” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts on Saturday spoke about his future during a general meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is about to go to re-election, she is opposed by Republican Party member Jeff Dille, who was co-chairman of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She was at the center of discussions as a possible rival to Trump in 2020.
Since Trump took office, it was the 36th meeting with voters in the format of a general assembly held on Saturday in Halioka.
One of the participants asked if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington to fix the broken government, and for this to be led by a woman.”
Arisht occurred after the death of basketball player Sims from the team of the University of Louisiana
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday announced that the suspect in the murder of U.S. basketball player Wade Sims on Friday was arrested.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dean Simpson during a press conference held at 11 a.m.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting requesting to help identify the person who appeared on it.
20-year-old Sims was shot dead on Friday morning near the South University campus.
“Wade Sims received a gunshot wound to the head as a result of which he died,” Murphy police chief J. Paul told reporters on 247sports on Saturday.
Wade stood up for his friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
During the interrogation, Simpson confessed to being at the crime scene, being armed and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson did not object to the arrest and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
A 6-foot, 6-inch (201 cm) tall junior grew up in Baton Rouge, Sims last season played in 32 games, of which 10 were on the pitch from the start, averaged 17.4 minutes on the pitch, scored 5.6 points and scored 2 goals.
The Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton came close to the title of world champion after he won a victory over Sebastian Vettel by internal agreement
From the moment Walter Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton at the qualifying race on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions inside the Mercedes team would play a significant role in the race.
Bottas pulled out a good spot on the cradle and almost abandoned Hamilton to his fate as he defended his spot in the first two victories and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Fethel was the first to go to the pit stop and left Hamilton to hang out at the end of the overall mass of the riders, it was this maneuver that was to be decisive.
The pilot of the "Mercedes" went on a pit stop for a circle later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after several round-in-round maneuvers that forced the driver of the "Ferrari" to leave the inner space free, risking the cruising to sustain after.
Max Verstappen on his 21st birthday started from the back row of the grid and was in seventh place by the end of the first round.
He then led most of the race while holding the tires because he wanted to finish quickly, beat Kimi Raikanen and take fourth place.
As a result, he went on a pit stop on the 44th round, but was unable to increase the speed on the remaining eight laps, so Rykanen took fourth place.
It's been a tough day because Walter's been performing fantastically all weekend and expressing himself as a real gentleman if I'm allowed to say so.
“The team has done an outstanding job to take first and second place,” Hamilton commented.
It was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diana Feinstein at a rally on Saturday because she insisted that she was not the source of the leaked letter of Christina Blacy Ford, in which she accused the candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanagh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting that what is happening in the Senate has shown how people can be “shameless, disgusting, and untrue.”
“The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see angry, ugly and lying people,” he said.
“When you read about press releases and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
That’s not me.”
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, is this your escape?
Do you remember her answer... you lost the document – “oh, oh, what?
No, no, no, no.
There was nothing from me.”
Wait a minute.
"We're not going to do it," he added, scolding the senator.
Feinstein in July sent a letter detailing the charges against Cavan, and he fled in early September – but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
“I didn’t hide the accusations of Dr. Ford, I didn’t let her story leak,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked for the story to remain confidential and I granted her request.”
But her refusal probably didn’t like the president, who commented so much during the Saturday meeting: “Here’s what I’ll tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of a Supreme Court candidate accused of sexual harassment by three women, the president has suggested that the Democrats are using the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means.
You see the meanness, the disgust, and they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to step through to get power and control,” – conveys the words of the president”Mediaite”.
Elite League: Dundee Stars – Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants in a match against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars played off for Friday's defeat to them by the Belfast Giants as part of the Elite League, winning a 5-3 draw in home games on Saturday.
Thanks to the blows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier, the Giants led on two goals at the beginning.

Air traffic controller dies, saving hundreds of passengers from earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has died heroically, ensuring the successful take-off of the plane with hundreds of passengers on board.
More than 800 people have died and many have been reported missing after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday triggered a tsunami.
Strong underground pushes are still ongoing, and many people are buried under the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues were escaping, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower, which swung wildly at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport.
It remained in place until the Batik Air 6321, which was at the time on the runway, broke off the ground.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, when he decided that it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
According to the Australian program «ABC News», according to the representative of «Air Navigation Indonesia» Johannes Sirait, the decision of the dispatcher may have saved hundreds of lives.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was supposed to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter flew to Pal.
“Our hearts are broken,” he added.
Meanwhile, the country's authorities fear that the number of victims may reach several thousand, and the disaster risk agency claims that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Bouton is limited.
A spokesman for Sutopa Purva Nugroha said: "Perhaps the number of victims will increase further, as many bodies have not yet been able to dig out of the rubble."
The praises, which reached up to six meters, devastated Palu, where a mass burial will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing humanitarian aid.
Rysa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the car is "fast" bringing bodies.
You don't get clean water.
There are shops all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help those who survived, but we don’t know what is waiting for them here.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
Indonesian President Jock Vidoda arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to complete the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” he asked CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lamboke that killed more than 550 people.
Air accident in Micronesia: according to "Air Niugini" one man went missing after the crash of the plane in the lagoon
The airline, which carried out the flight, which made an emergency landing in the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, previously claimed that all 47 passengers and the crew were safely evacuated from the plane, which was sinking, and now declares the disappearance without the knowledge of one passenger.
Air Niugini said in a press release that as of Saturday, it could not provide a report on the whereabouts of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately report details of the passenger; for example, his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the rest of the passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water when trying to land at the Chuvk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been admitted to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash, as well as the exact sequence of events, remain unexplained.
According to both the airline and the U.S. Navy, the plane landed in the lagoon, not reaching the landing strip.
According to some witnesses, the plane skipped the landing strip.
According to American passenger Bill Janes, the plane flew very low.
“It’s a great idea,” Janet said.
According to him, he and others were able to penetrate the belt in the water to the emergency exits of the plane, which was already sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, as well as that he suffered a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors repairing a nearby pier also helped rescue the boat, using an inflatable boat to carry people to shore until the plane sank at a depth of about 100 feet (30 meters).
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people were killed in the crash of registered in Papua New Guinea aircraft over the past twenty years, but none of them belonged to Air Niugini.
An analyst restores the course of events at night, when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the indictment ended the presentation of evidence in a retrial of the case of a man accused of burning a resident of the state of Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlette has for several hours provided evidence as an engaged expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to reinvent the movements of 29-year-old respondent Quinton Thelis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
As reported by The Clarion Ledger, according to Rowlet, he received information about the place from several mobile phones that showed that Télis was with Chambers the night of her death, which contradicts his past statements.
When the information that his cell phone was near Chambers's phone at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford was confirmed, the police were sent to question Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecution asked whether Télis was telling the truth that Sanford was in the van that night, he stated that he was "lying as my van was in Nashville".
Another contradiction was Thelis's claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they knew each other for only a week.
According to Rowlett, some time after her death, Chambers Thales deleted her messages, calls and contacts from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Haley said.
The side of the defense should start arguing on Sunday.
According to the judge, the case is expected to be referred to the jury later in the day.

There's another black hole?!
New York babysitter sues a married couple for “racist” message after being fired
A New York City nanny sues a married couple for discriminating dismissal after receiving an accidental message from her mother complaining that she is "another black woman".
The couple denies that they are racists, equating the lawsuit to "extortion".
In 2016, Lynsey Plaska-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed disappointment when she discovered that the new babysitter, Gisele Morris, was black-skinned when she arrived on her first working day.
“She’s not, she’s just black,” Mrs. Plaska-Flexman wrote in a message to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to her husband, she sent a message to Miss Morris twice.
According to the New York Post, realizing the mistake, “feel awkward” Plaska-Flexman fired Miss Morris, claiming that the former nanny, who was also an African-American, was poorly coping with the job, and that she was waiting for her Filipina instead.
Ms. Morris paid for the day's work and was sent home on Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple and wants to receive compensation for her dismissal under the terms on which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract: $350 a day for six months with accommodation.
“I want to show them that this is not the way to do it,” she told the Post on Friday.
The couple denounced the accusations of racism, arguing that the dismissal of Morris was a sensible decision, given that they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her what she shouldn’t have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racist,” – said “Post” husband, Joel Plaska.
“Would you trust your children to deal with someone who is rude, even if by chance?
Your baby's?
“Is it?”
Plaska equates the lawsuit to “extortion” and reports that his wife gave birth just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation”.
“And you’re going to chase a man in such a situation?
That’s pretty tough,” added a specialist in investment banking.
Although the litigation is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, subjecting sharp criticism of their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Podington feared that readers would not supersede the talking bear, says the new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, wrote about the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
So interesting to read, already knowing about the great success of Podington."
She said her father, who worked as a BBC operator before daring to write a children's book about a little toy bear, was optimistic despite his work being rejected and added that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "bitter-sweet" after his death last year.
She added that her father was quietly proud of his final success, speaking of Padington, whom she describes as a "very important member of our family".
"He was a very quiet man, and not at all boastful," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost a paternal honor for a child who achieved something: you are proud of them, although in fact it is not your merit.
I think that's how he saw his success.
Even though it was his creation, the product of his imagination, he always paid tribute to Paddington himself."
My daughter died, and I had to pick her up on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors fought for her life in vain.
“Over the phone regularly to tell you that everything is really bad, that she can’t stand,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then she called me over to tell me that she was going to die within the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, “I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave to beat her heart, slowly left her body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end.
I just had to sit there, knowing that everything was unfolding.
I couldn't cry or cry, because there were people around me.
I had to keep up.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was suffering the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers - and they did not know what she had to go through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I’ve been crying all day, and I’ve been crying all day.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt Ned's compassion.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who are grieving postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones, who have committed suicide, do everything to ensure that other people do not take their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post cards on warm words and phone numbers that people can use to get help on a bridge in Wales.
Mrs. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began his depression, and at the age of 18 he committed suicide.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the way I do,” she said.
A 45-year-old woman, Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a talented boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
People said that his smile would light up any room. "
However, before his death, he quit his job because he was “in a very dark place”.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother's body when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that this could have unpleasant consequences."
Mrs. Davis created the cards, “so that people know that there are people in the world that you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t stay silent – you have to talk.”
Ms. Husfries, who has been friends with Ms. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her partner, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say that he was sad, or that he was depressed, or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed that his attitude changed.
On the holy day he was very depressed: when the children opened the gifts, he did not even look at them. "
She said that his death was a great trauma for them, but it was necessary to live with it: “There was a huge hole in the family.
It's just killing us.
But you have to live and fight.”

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is uncertain, as the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought we could have what he wants — a time-limited and comprehensive investigation — we could get a little bit of unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was concerned that the committee was “collapsing” because it actually got into a traffic jam.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is sometimes explained.
Interim elections in just five weeks, November 6 – when the Republicans are expected to suffer defeat, then they will be weakened in their attempts to elect the candidate they need to the Supreme Court.
George W. Bush called the senator to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during the Bush presidency and through him met his wife Ashley, who then served as Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI publishes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where now sits 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes during the Senate vote, which will allow Vice President Mike Pence to address the issue of equality of votes and approve it in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea has decreased under the leadership of Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean official said.
Park Bo Song, quoting data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said there were 1,127 defectors last year and 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said the main reasons were the increased border controls between North Korea and China and the higher prices set by smugglers for the shipment.
Pyongyang hasn't said anything about it.
Most of the refugees from the north, with the result that they receive the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, with North Korea's longest border. It's easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is very heavily protected.
China sees refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks on denuclearization.
This came after a historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, when they agreed on a joint term to work with the goal of completely freeing the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Yang Ho accused the U.S. of failing to make progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such conditions we are not going to disarm first,” Mr. Ree said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Bret Cavanaugh a “historian,” she says he shouldn’t be working in the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court nominee Breto Cavanaugh a "historian" and said that in his temperament he is not suitable for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said this in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help thinking that if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called ‘historical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s speech before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh emotionally refuted the accusations of sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blazey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Cavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes even screaming and unable to speak when his family and high school classes were discussed.
He also vehemently blamed Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him a “grotesque and organized murder of a person” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's speech showed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because he clearly showed that he had a bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the manner in which he spoke about Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh, if he was elected and if the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say this – if he’s not telling the truth in Congress or the FBI, then he not only shouldn’t be working in the Supreme Court, but in the court where he’s working now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a member of the Democratic Party, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Medicine Act or the Row v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“Now is not the time for hysterical, non-objective individuals to work in court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful it is,’” Pelosi said.
A woman should be able to do that.
It's a justified indictment speech, months and years of anger just spills over, and she can't remember it without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years ago.
"I don't think it's that rare."
She continued: “I had a lot of help from a woman who was working as a director somewhere and who said that when she got angry, she cried, but she worked out a technique of behavior. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor: ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
I just kept talking.
I think it was great.”
Tears are allowed in part as an output amount, because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories from my first job, in which I once cried with inexpressible anger, then I was caught by the collar of an elderly woman – a restrained boss, who always scared me a little – and dragged me to the stairs.
“Never allow yourself to be seen in tears,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they brought you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congressman-democrat from the state of Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hunt got married on a yacht called Monkey Business and walked out of the presidential race, a very angry Mrs. Schroeder thought she could participate in the presidential campaign herself.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates, and they didn’t need me at all.
Some have called this situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the company has been running for quite a long time, it lacked funds, so she said that she would not take part in the elections if she did not raise $2 million.
It was a losing situation.
It turned out that some of her fans, who donated $1,000 to the men, gave her only $250.
"Do you think I'm going with a discount?" she thought.
When she made a statement that she would not participate in the election campaign, she was so deeply touched by emotions – thanks to the people who supported her, anger at the system that made it so difficult to get money and aimed at voters, not candidates, and anger at sexism – that she caught her breath.
"You might think that I have a nervous breakdown," recalled Ms. Schroeder's reaction to the press on her condition.
“You might think that my corporate sponsor is the manufacturer of paper napkins Kleenex.
I used to think, what are they going to write on my headstone?
“She was crying?”
Why the trade war between China and the United States could be good for Beijing
The first salvos of the trade war between China and the United States were deafening, and since the war is far from over, in the longer term misunderstandings between the countries may be in Beijing's favor, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year, taxing China's main export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week when new tariffs affected goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of the goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Each time, Beijing responded in the same way, recently raising tariffs from five percent to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised a symmetrical response to the United States, and the second-largest economy is unlikely to lead the eye.
In order to force Washington to retreat, it is necessary to delve into the demand, but a public inclination to the United States is almost unacceptable to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure of the US trade war in the long run can support China, reducing the mutual dependence of the two countries.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a sharp economic downturn is much more dangerous than observers previously thought,” said Abigail Grace, an assistant researcher specializing in Asia, in a research-based new research center.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and calls for assistance in rebuilding a country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"As of today, the situation in the country is more stable and safer, thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists in order to return to normal life.

Europe won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn scored 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Michelson, who fought the most in the tournament, drove his ball into the water for 3 pairs of the 16th hole, conceding this match to Francesco Malinara.
Italian golfer Malinari played well in all rounds, becoming one of four players to pass this field with a score of 5-0-0 since the start of the tournament in the current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spies was knocked out with the number 5 and 4 player with the lowest rating in the European team, Thornbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olsen from Denmark.
The world's top player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Ian Paulter of England, who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Spaniard Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran of the eight Rydar Cups, has become the player with the most wins in a tournament with a career score of 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t hold back.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas, who chose me and believed in me.
I'm so happy to get the cup back.
It's all about the team and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said in shock after winning the European team.
He handed the relay to his countryman John Ram, who on Sunday defeated the legend of American golf Tiger Woods in singles 2&1 matches.
"I'm very proud to have won Tiger Woods, the man I've followed since I was a kid," said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his queens in France and now has a record number 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
The amazing statistics of one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles and lags behind only Jack Niklaus in this indicator.
The American team fought with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tney Finn, who played top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Fury said after a disappointing game in defense of his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're fairy tales.
This morning, we showed Europe what we can do.
We've competed.
Take off your hats in honor of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, I will work with the American Golf Association and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Take off your hat in front of them.
We were overtaken.”
