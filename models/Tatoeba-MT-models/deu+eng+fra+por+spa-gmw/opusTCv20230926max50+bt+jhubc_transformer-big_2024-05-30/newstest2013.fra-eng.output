A Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, claiming that election fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only documented 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It was in this spirit that a majority of U.S. governments enacted new laws starting in 2009 that made the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in the year 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID card and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and withdraw the right to vote from citizens with a judicial record.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to make such a requirement.
In 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such an identity document.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect youth, minorities, and low-income people.
Indeed, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
A lot more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
Two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns helped to register about 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed laws in five other states aimed at shortening the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted ahead were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
It was the same with Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, white voters, who made up 76 percent of voters, accounted for only 46 percent of early voting voters.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by vetoes from Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as an obvious goal to influence results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report showed that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed by the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Passing the Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes men who are already reluctant to pass screening tests even more hesitant.
Pass the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European one, found a difference in mortality between patients who had a screening and those who did not.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that we are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if we are not screened.
So I recommend the test from 50 years of age, or from 40 years of age if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead opting, in these cases, for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest that they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, the criteria for deciding who should or should not be dealt with are being precisely determined.
I recommend taking the test anyway.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether or not you should pass it.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in research, adopting good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many are also completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is very damaging to the health of people.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
The Weight
Overweight and obesity also promote the onset of the disease, according to the CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal, esophageal, pancreatic, and uterine cancer.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against colon cancer,” the researchers said.
The food industry
The body also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Deli meats too, and they should be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they say.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the CSC.
While one of them noted a decreased risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu stresses the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Passing a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson dissected
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a stir last summer, and for good reason.
It is believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it closely resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, but data is still lacking to be perfectly certain.
Suppose it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let's see what it is.
There is, in this low world, a inevitably inevitable law that two things cannot end up in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break this rule – and don’t try too hard, you’re going to hurt yourself.
Even though particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the (absolutely extraordinary) The Particle Adventure site, from the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not discuss here, and the "particles of force", through which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, it must be emphasized here, are not all beasts as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or "particle of light" that is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field at that precise location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" arises an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "force-bearing" bosons.
More stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, that must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
Now, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it were a frozen pond, only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the one at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km ring of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful in explaining the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Indeed, not all particles, nor all materials, interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold of itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, hold) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between MS observations and predictions.
In fact, there are many who fervently wish that one finds it, because the slightest difference could open a door on a "new physics" and block some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (re-ops!).
But no such deviations have been found at CERN until now.
Impacts
The repercussions of this research on the daily life of Monsieur and Madame Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser technology at Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution their work was about to unleash.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - already told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a "lab gadget".
Just imagine...
And then, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, this same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original intent, now serves as an "eye" to all the digital cameras in the world, and earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This of course does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative Care - The Best Way to Die... <0x7C> Duty
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, in this essential area, much remains to be done.
The Duty tried to take a closer look at it.
Only a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The cancer of the prostate that was eating him had left him a respite of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I was seven years old," says he, half fig half grape, lying in his bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for it," he said.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Nestled in front of an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicines, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is that I get cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this ailment.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man pisses standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois house.
Returning to the stage of the child, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home all suffer from cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides so-called "curative" care.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and suffocated."
But the disease made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she expects a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, we provide body care and food assistance.
These are palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, we will agree to provide mouth care for brandy or Pepsi, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, a beer was served to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help loved ones as much as patients," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but do not resemble each other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well-kept in his pillows while drinking in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after trying everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," Dr. Christiane Martel worries.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems with access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in the hospital or in the nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Greater Montreal Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that makes several doctors specializing in palliative care fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care boards including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room, in great pain, without doing what was necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients ask to die only because they don't get the right care.
And at the same time, several oncologists are hard on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Helene Richard’s hopes for survival were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me I was done!
No all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not acceding to their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping the patient until the time of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” it means “I want to be relieved.”
This story was made possible through a Journalism Fellowship from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know about a formidable “system” of building industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosos.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has crumbled since we took the big money," said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a substantive investigation into the embezzlements related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, had only consented backwards.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, occult party funding and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, the only transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," some refraining from their instincts to hit a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will succeed in "demonstrating the ploys behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also engaged in this with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, have led the "cartel des seuls" of Montreal to put the soft pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out mass searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against elected officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly pocketing bribes in exchange for public contracts.
They are also formally accused of engineers at the Montreal roads and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who gave the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito sowed at full speed in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, especially the then-ruling Liberals.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts that he inflated costs
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption was working roundly.
Gilles Surprisant, a former public works engineer, detailed it before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totaling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts that he inflated costs.
Other road officials confessed to greasing their paws by inflating bills by 30% to 40%, with fake extras.
Then a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first women elected in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought 5 million dollars and resold... 1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that it "pulls on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is “painful but positive.”
We are cleaning the wound, but it would take a proper investigation unit in Montreal and a watch, so as not to see the dubious practices return.
It's like cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elects aware of the scheme", when they did not soak in the scam!
Estimating at 70% the share of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to parties to $100, but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go any lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I move on with them.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And in a match, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get burned.
From my debut at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation centre to my time in Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed step by step.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot in terms of my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
Oh, sure.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a lot of experience and has won a lot of titles with fancy clubs.
He has been with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I came out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me also explains my performance.
What do you think about the first half of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the lead place.
But we're still ambushed.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th round with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to go as far as we can.
Anything can happen now.
But we will have our say in front of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our pool, ahead of Porto, to be able to receive in the 8th round of return.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget.
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the long term.
Today, this is not the case.
Financially, the PSG is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In Ligue 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title.
Last season, we didn't get far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champions...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it’s the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It’s normal to expect a lot from us in the light of what has been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reproach us, it is for sure a bit frustrating.
I wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer present.
Look at Manchester City that hasn’t been able to qualify for the 8th round in two seasons, they’ve also made huge expenses!
In view of the sums invested, we imagined you with 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
It shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
Better to say there's a "Zlatan addiction."
This means that Ibrahimovic is very good and he has a lot of goals.
He came here for that and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He has demonstrated everywhere he has gone that he is a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from picking up playing time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
Lessons have been learned from what happened in Ukraine and we owe it to exemplary behaviour today.
What are your thoughts on the first months of Didier Deschamps as head of the Blues?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying for the Euro.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) taken on October 16 in Spain a founding match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
This is the opposite of current central bank-based currency exchanges, identified transactions and processing fees between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a peak of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the website bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
Yet the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competitive with the dollar or euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as “credits”, used to progress in a video game that you earn by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes trade in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and handles the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the nodes in the network are both bookkeepers, verifiers, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the manner of an email.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public account book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It involves solving a mathematical challenge for computers, and the winner, sort of a temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructiblely linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphaned because the two have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving some margin.
The difficulty of the challenge is also met with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
“The flaw used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also mentions the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this defect.
Major players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, “giant sales” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” said Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real money) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come back cheaper.
The wearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they have to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicted.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of the success of this currency.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is mainly the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse foreign military presence, as in the days of the Soviets.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes aided by local insurgents, they will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban surge in Kabul as of the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and bloody as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved nowadays.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in an inferior position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it as building land to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They disregarded themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American bounties: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They sided with the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they enjoyed the benefits of it.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full, both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work for these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that feature a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that are going to command it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been, since the 1950s and long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in repair, no major irrigation systems are repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was a rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province’s most important employers.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent, to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department at university, French institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to achieve the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a "civil-military actions" department of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has conducted, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous collective work and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which requires local labor, was able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase of arable land.
What will we leave as a memory, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres above sea level.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurrection led by foreign groups, as I have been told by farmers to wish, small, well-controlled and direct civilian aid would have to be maintained in their favour.
A Constitution with a forceps in Egypt
This is President Mohammed Morsi's new poker move.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its part.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State had granted this Assembly two more months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only widened the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "betray his word" and "trampling the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he said in an interview with the US weekly Time.
Especially since this recourse to a hasty vote holds the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers", these supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the vast majority Islamist, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals were missing the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, believing that they could not make their views known.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society had done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, replacement members, were hurriedly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, most of the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators have also been amused that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the time of prayer, with some members of the committee believing that the constituent's clock was poorly regulated.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, has 234 articles.
Article 2 remains the same as the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the Liberals respond, who see it only as a communication blow.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the compliance of laws with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see in it the beginnings of a theocracy.”
The fears of the Liberals are further fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system "tempers Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another issue: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military tribunals be prohibited, as demanded by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticidal.
Blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, no article echoes the protection of women anymore, said Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five great reasons to travel to Israel.
Go to worship the holy places
A must-see event: the banks of the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptism grounds” will be touched by divine grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was in this very place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk along the Street of Suffering or the Way of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the praetorium), where the trial took place, then leads through the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
It is here that the Christian center of the world is located, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wailing Wall, which constitutes the remainder of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different denominations leave little words accompanied by prayers that are then answered.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the Massada Fortress, a former refuge from enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there on their own.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists in winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
Old beliefs claim that pagan gods once inhabited the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
Impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (the parliament).
It houses the ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea manuscripts, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, as well as nearly 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to see: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It exhibits mainly the paintings of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Al-Basha Hammam awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of castings of visitors and supervisors of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire sculptures by Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which revisits the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are shining.
Then you hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
Israel's three major seaside resorts lie on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, as the water temperature does not drop below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can swim there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Blue-colored water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who cannot swim.
The landscapes that surround it are of surreal beauty.
They come to carry out a treatment based on salt water, silt, healing sludge and to cure various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk through the narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who have come to do photo shoots from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar equals 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and able to connect the lower and upper parts of the city.
It is almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes based on lamb and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also hummus, traditional Jewish dough, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-fed cats that walk around with high air.
We can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars at night.
These cats love passing places and do not refuse to be enjoyed.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
Three million tourists from around the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists traveled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists controversy over what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Each year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are Central Asian nationals: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal: to make money to help their families staying at home.
Since December 1, a law has entered into force that stipulates that every migrant worker will have to pass a Russian exam.
At the moment, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your language skills in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or diplomas of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centers will be under the aegis of the Russian Language Institute Pushkin, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the exams in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already asked the press many times: what will it do?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery at work".
Many are talking about defending the rights of migrant workers, explains the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will torment themselves for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they are taken their passports, and they do not receive the planned salary," said Tolib Sharipov, the head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Tajikistan Migration Service.
Don't argue with me, policeman!
However, many Central Asian nationals who wish to make money in Russia trust that they not only do not know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children without dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach their teenage years, these young people make money as soon as the opportunity presents itself.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language, they say.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
Human rights defenders, however, note an important aspect of the language law.
The exams will only be for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 thousand rubles.
And then, one can get a fake registration quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have fake documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us for 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea," Oumed Khouchkadamov, a Tajik national, told reporters.
"Make it quick, don't let it down and buy yourself a beautiful work of art."
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrant registration papers were not the only ones to be fake.
Several fake language exam certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not take them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of exams had to pay 7,000 rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Power officials and human rights defenders agree that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “tips of paper.”
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to pass the first exam time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is proposing to tighten the law against civilian weapons bearers.
This is the reaction of the authorities in the face of recent incidents: whether it be the shootings at weddings or the killing organised by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of rubber bullet weapons in public places and raise the legal age for gun licences from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the arms law would be introduced at the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw".
An open letter has appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC, told the Russian service.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168,000 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening laws on civilian weapons will not prevent criminals from sourcing from the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow you can find any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served ten years in the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking commands of weapons
The first is "military trace", that is, weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians," Baranets said.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen by criminals from law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stockpiles and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
Illegal pistols go on sale from military warehouses.
Many of these have often been subjected to explosions.
"Attested reports indicate that some fires were deliberately set off to cover up the deficit," the former military official said.
For Baranets, the weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow,” one expert said.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A significant share of pistols and machine guns came from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons in the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers say, come from the military and law enforcement.
Half of the guns on the black market have been found there "due to the fault of employees whose work is related to guns," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "illegal searches".
A salesman and consultant at an armory who asked to remain anonymous says that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these specialists in the clandestine search; they are too old.
Most often, he says, sellers will pick up new goods from military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, for example a TT pistol.
We deliver it to him by passing the goods through a wire mesh.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for 900 € per unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a check purchase from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I checked sites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone had to take me to a "coin" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, says the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust them.
There are sellers in the markets, but there you also have to come and say, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to convey that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows I won't give them.
The little ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former militaryman Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, he said, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” recalls the soldier.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the forest and we set up a target.
“I’m allowed to shoot and when I’m convinced the gun works well, we start negotiating,” he said.
A shop from the couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
For this, we do not need any documents and no one to meet.
"It is enough to have a precise amount of money," the advertisement reads on the site "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (orthography preserved).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia

I have heard about this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take control.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"In return, he receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the association "Right to a weapon".
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, one can end up without a gun and behind bars.
The Federal Security Service has spread a huge network of fake sites and picks up people who want to buy combat weapons.
"People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves mining coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts believe, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a Makarov gun for 100-300 dollars.
It will take about a month and a half.
It was released from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia has decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs have decreased by 7.8%.
U.S.: Fast Food and Supermarket Employees Strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against low wages by Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
At the moment, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or breathe out quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
Along with the increase in modest wages for basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want the creation of unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday," as a surging rain of salaries seizing millions of people hit America and sometimes sparking outcry.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs to organize pickets of strikes with unions and left-wing activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many low-paying employees at Walmart shop only at their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheaply because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests demanded a salary increase, complaining that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who gets $9.5 an hour, that's an amount he can't afford.
Scientists at California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
That’s 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart were to transfer all the wage increases on the shoulders of consumers, every run in the store would be 46 cents more.
They will spend $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters note with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did no harm to the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in stores from 8 am in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over that period 5,000 items per second.
His coffers made a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday".
A spokesperson for the company Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that “less than five” Walmart employees had left their jobs and that the protest was just a “com’ operation among many” on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not there yet) but McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s advertises selling billions of servings and then they don’t even give you sick leave and don’t pay you for the work you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, the minimum wage provided by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food grows over time, but on average, its core employees in New York City earn $8.90 an hour.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It is inconceivable for me to live with this sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you are going to feed them.
The protesters who launched the move Thursday at 6.30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the creation of unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters with bullying or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, seizing fast food remains a difficult task, and that for concrete reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
They don't agree
Other tumultuous protests were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near Times Square's McDonald's with the intervention of several local Democratic politicians, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's announcement sells billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the job you've done honestly!"
The protesters were backed by other prominent New York Democrats, including mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio who said, “We all need to support fast food workers so they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized the event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its entire history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain."
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it emerges from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft lab in Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to broaden the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained for the moment with flat screen pixels and sometimes with touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will happen with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox sells today without Kinect because everyone is interested in controlling by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us too?
- Although the Kinect made the physical interaction, a lot of things take place on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information entry has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for the moment, is not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that run on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We must bring the computer world out into our own, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds it.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to begin with, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality headsets!
- What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but isn’t it overestimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt based on what the machine can or can't do at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on developing new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be laser sensors, for example, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we rely in our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but rather the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c/s is really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond lab, gave the touch of the sensors a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 <0xCE><0xBC>s, with the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like that in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames per second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect today has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem.
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to the Kinect, play with the curve of the cameras and see how it could help define the locations.
As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the platforms with the most perspectives?
- Of course, walking all the time with a smartphone with your hands raised is not convenient but here is what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transient" that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time weak: Augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point to: there is no tactile sensation!
The hands feel nothing!
What responses does your group prepare to this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as an image medium.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are actually meant to assign palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of your fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work presenting perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him believe that he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There’s still a task below that will take a long time to work on: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that they are walking in an open space that is almost infinite – we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
At the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste, not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "The Petersburg avant-garde" dedicated to urban dwellers who are ahead, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the St. Petersburg art scene whose achievements extend beyond the city’s border and who have found recognition in Europe, after being known all over Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed in red that can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in trendy parties and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of where they are exhibited.
He was one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Saint Petersburg storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller was an eminent representative of the Petersburg avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the locals smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands an organ of Barbary and he became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray arouses aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, of my kind, were misunderstood.
I began to befriend the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina that gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took my place in Pushkinskaya-10 which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the home of the Petersburg Bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arriving with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in tight-fitting jerseys, including Igor Vdovin, today's fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg was a host of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it is here that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Artistic Clinic.
Our employees left as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the days when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organized in the press: it was the "Persönlichkeiten unserer Stadt" award.
I was named Painter of the Year, and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, one can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very current and a very strong sharpness.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through Clowns".
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, now it hurts and it's scary to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the dress that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit him in the forehead.
And the lie will be obliterated by the disguise.
- Recently we saw you playing the organ player of Barbary. - A cultural city must have that kind of hero.
Who other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be neat, delicate, liquorish.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
Before, people were divided into herds, the supporters of the bohemian loved one thing, the negators another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But several thousand people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we've thrown away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and in the end it is less management, money, everything witheres.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to fool them, not to spoil the experience.
When I was young, I was painting paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the civil servant of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good czars, it was not like that, the czars did not understand culture well, but they understood that the good experts had to be kept.
In Moscow today, there are good consultants.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are dismissed, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make their way.
Currently, it is the "kingdom of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all the contemporary art, that there are painters who must find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people who will see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Fellowship
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Caravans of space shuttles with earthlings on board set out in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a big question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a planet of relief?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
"These are Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If the conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500.
We can only live there at very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earthly varieties.
Then insects, small breeding Drosophila flies were put into orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo developed into weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal chick at the exit.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chick has to find support, it has to get on its feet and start moving," says Vladimir Sychev, director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP).
When no support was found, the chicks stirred in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophied.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
“We squinted their eyes twice and then gave up, because it’s simply impossible to work with them there,” says Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still about biosatellites and then it's the only experiment. We have to do this kind of research," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions have not yet been made directly in space.
It's not a small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is capable of creating a suitable emotional background.
This type of experiment is not carried out for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female organism is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold up after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
“No one was answering that question,” says Vakhtang Vatchnadze, a retired rocket and space veteran.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a baby girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even worked in an extravehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbital flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valery Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Hydrology laboratory of the Centre for the preparation of cosmonauts: obligatory stage of the preparation for flight.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train for extra-vehicle exits.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but nevertheless a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to water afterwards.
This is in principle logical, because from birth until its first bath, it only happens 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on the birth simulators.
One can of course prepare a childbirth in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite reflection on this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
An infant cannot be dressed as an adult with a special training suit.
It will simply be deprived of its vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely misfit," predicts the Director of the Committee for Bioethics of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, over time this will become a reality, when the Earthlings will travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their offspring born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Institution of Control of Public Finance) said: "The control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system") has failed because of the politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation but is lagging behind in its enforcement.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the vice-president of the Higher Institution of Control of Public Finance, said in an interview for Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but its enforcement must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us,” Kala said in his commentary on the current situation.
A joint check by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' approach to the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc system" as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG is not going to bother entrepreneurs with controls; is that allowed or prohibited?
“The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits anything, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority charged with inspecting from demanding compliance with the law,” Kala said.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you mentioned a Czech-German draft in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, EU legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and practice itself.
We have put all this together and although this control procedure is not yet complete, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and of better quality", nevertheless, by some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms that it is not enough to continuously develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote oneself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you concretely and what does it result for you?
Such a common oversight should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve the thresholds, when it does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering the thresholds of the markets will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork that those looking for the flaws will find far more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our ISC or a different mode of organization?
As for the institutions, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organized in a similar way, it also has a council made up a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way .
The competences are also, to some extent, similar, but with a nuance compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the different Länder.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our case corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds managed by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder’s accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Is it because they have better inspectors?
No, certainly not, but I repeat, I do not have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the law on public procurement meant for you as an institution? Are its effects already being felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we carry out post-checks, we must expect a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparing for future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detection of risks of mismanagement" with which we have screened almost 14,000 public procurement contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you consider the adoption of this law to be an advantage or an additional burden on the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and that it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the previous regulations, the claimant (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) was forcing the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law would mean a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it, but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences for the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS will not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system - what does that mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system banned or allowed?
The law must be enforced in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demand compliance with the law.
He can declare, “We will change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say that we will act as if nothing was going on.
The Law on Contracts contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads are frozen in places, but most are still practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snowy.
However, the network remains largely practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were passable this morning, but in frozen and snowy places.
Temperatures have dropped and oscillate between -5°C and -10°C but they are expected to rise slightly in the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains in the plains.
However, the ridges of the Metaliferous Mountains (Kru<0xC5><0xA1>né hory) are covered with about 30 centimeters of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that visibility was reduced in places due to fog.
The R6 expressway and national roads in the region are now easily accessible.
However, vigilance is still required, for example on certain bridges whose coating can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental roads and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
There is still on some of their sections remnants of frozen snow and in places crowded by traffic.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some Eastern Bohemian roads are threatened by ice formation and that snow can be loaded by traffic on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>kroun, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Svitavy or Vysoké M<0xC3><0xBD>to, mainly on the departmental and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads around Svitavy have been chemically treated.
Snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov, a layer of snow loaded by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be dry today, mostly clear, with scattered clouds.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will usually range between -3°C and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practicable, although, in some places, there is a need for increased vigilance and adaptation to weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be in frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the regional road maintenance service.
The D5 is almost easily accessible, but road maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometres 80 and 131.
The lining of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the Pilsen-Sud district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third-category roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less-traffic roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to high-altitude areas of the Olomouc region now have to rely on a layer of thick, soft snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the pass called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall last night forced the road maintenance staff to go to the field; according to road services, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk.
In other parts of the region, most pavements are easily accessible.
" On the heights of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk there are remnants of snow.
Drivers driving towards Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k should expect to encounter at the pass called "<0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské sedlo" a layer of thick and soft snow," the head of road maintenance services of the district of <0xC5><0xA0>umperk told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
Their colleagues from the Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k district also travelled to the site overnight; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are easily accessible, but in the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberk district drivers should be careful in sections in forested areas with roadways that have remained wet.
Regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec
As of this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia have reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Kninice na <0xC3><0x9A>stecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially southeast of the Central Bohemian Plateau, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, especially around <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowfall during the day, clear skies and frosts during the night.
Difficult conditions on National Highway 13 at the border between the regions of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec are also reported from the main traffic routes.
The closure of traffic between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh rather and we think that we are the only group able to collect a remnant of positive energy in order to repel or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, you’re putting together a very unique project in December: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years now.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21st at 11am 10am.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end practically by the time the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed it with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want to think together, with the public, about the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The band The Tap Tap with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled "End of the world cancelled" (in Czech "Konec sv<0xC4><0x9B>ta zru<0xC5><0xA1>eno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear it at these charity concerts?
Of course, all in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in all three concerts.
The anthems will also be joined at some point as part of a very unique live broadcast on Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák who also plays the lead role of Jesus in the music video, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize many concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose work we have been working on within the framework of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, with the association Tap, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will several music groups and performers take to the stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will surely prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the home of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not so bad that it looks at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose equipment must travel in the hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments....
So far everything has more or less always gone well, <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they have surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Through your travels abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very poorly accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being created that seeks to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities actively participate in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Respect for the public and ease of access are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
At the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap band is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what pushed you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am a musician myself (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we have lost a bit of control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It’s true, creating connections with well-known singers and actively working to promote the band helped us.
We understood that if a work is not visible, it is as if it does not exist in the background.
Thanks to the grants from the European Union, we can, in addition, allow ourselves to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copies each other.
In a way, it makes sense: anything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural.
But pity is totally useless, because people with a disability are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, that we must take pity on.
They are people who can live a life of their own and flourish, provided they have the necessary means of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only an advancement for them but for society as a whole.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be uncompromising in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people come home with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to the rehearsals twice a week, take the preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Lá<0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D>.
We're an open group, people come in and out, we can't do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the planned end of the world day, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relay when The Tap Tap’s song “End of the Cancelled World” is sung together.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds (to the tune of CZK 25 million) to equip the multifunctional training centre Studeo which is located in Prague in the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>ka Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency, it is the second member state of the former Eastern Bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in the years that followed participated in a number of ESA projects.
Poland's journey to space, however, began much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on spaceflights; they did not always meet understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, the conference of A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics".
The said doctor Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a world-renowned propagator of astronautics, his contribution was rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925 a draught was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the draisine.
The only information known about this draisine is that of the press at the time.
From 1933 onwards, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The evidence in the records indicates that this research had reached the testing stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search was interrupted.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric fighter rocket, drawn by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
These two projects were intended for military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects for the use of rocket technology were conducted by the provisional scientific advisory committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronaut society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the newspaper Problème, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society devoted to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (established in 1951) and as early as the fall, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice-president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956 onwards, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the RM weather rocket (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, the RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
This rocket with a range of 1800 meters had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
An upgraded version, RM-1A, was subsequently built and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket was developed between 1962 and 1965 and succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B that volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautics Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the program.
The repeal of the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Service Works Act.
This decision has sparked a lively discussion in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Economic systems oriented towards liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concretely means that the different economic entities as well as the national economic systems are perpetually in conflict with one another.
This results from the principle of freedom of trade and free (unlimited) movement of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the price of labour (wage) generate a tension on prices.
The following meaning must be given to this term: a producer strives by importing goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by "making" the price of the competitor more expensive, with the aim of taking away a greater share of the market and thus increasing his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at low prices, or disappear. The result is significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and thus no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the state's social charges necessarily increase.
This whole situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so publicly known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create in the different economies a situation in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments are putting their own people at the mercy of private capital without regard to social collapse.
This is mainly reflected in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to economically compel its own population to accept the dictate of the prices of private capital, especially in the area of wages.
This is achieved on the one hand by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and on the other hand by the restriction of the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
The result is increasing poverty and deepening differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for the poor for years, who cannot provide for themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
In the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the state is forced to pay an extra to reach the minimum living wage.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern Member States of the EU undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or to live on miserable wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will be invested in their country.
The question is, where does this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media say, tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence, and even does not today, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and, by the same token, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of bills to law firms closely linked to the industry.
These bills were then passed in the Bundestag.
The totality of power does not come from the people, as the Western-style constitutions declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is evident that liberalist-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his work entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The state was long in decline and functions were attributed by violence.
Bribes, illegally obtained favors, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The under-table and the corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with already sold votes"... ... "The honest people did not seek at all to obtain functions, it resulted once the state was transformed 8 months without consuls".... ' It really began to be said that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy, but that it was "absolutely necessary" to choose a man n...
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is an unprecedented decadence of elites, with no effort to carry out in-depth reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the current state of affairs, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today's elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
Repealing the Public Utility Works Act is not a solution, at least not in the long run.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and at the internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution is socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens' influence on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song titled Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want wars, there wouldn’t be wars,” said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take the side of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and putting the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurring killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the Autonomous Territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a behind-the-curtain view of the one that benefits mainly from the tensions that have been going on for more than 95 years (as of the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to study, others emerge from my own understanding of the one, or more accurately the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
In every era, we can find either an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in an age where global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration that generates certain powers has not been able to be done in a single generation.
Among the families with astronomical wealth stands out particularly the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don’t know if these families still have a leader but I don’t exclude him).
Little is written about them.
Of course I will.
As early as the 1990s, they acquired the world’s first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the link between their name and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortunes or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq by 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi by only 4, meanwhile Russia has placed the Russian central bank under Russian control).
Anyone who has tried to stand up against this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Rothschild Bank of America’s central bank status and began issuing his own money during the civil war (government, I understand well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the Fed, he was assassinated in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to bring a lawsuit against the Fed for triggering the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a three world wars plan by Albert Pike, a Freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The first was aimed at eliminating the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, notably British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a final solution, absolve power), and,
The method used by the clan of the wealthiest families with the Rothschilds at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed intended to avoid the recurrence of crises such as those they provoked in 1907).
After succeeding in triggering the First World War by the assassination at Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended abruptly with a German capitulation without economic and military justifications (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed the politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany a huge war reparations, thus generating the conditions for a radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the culprits, proposing simple solutions).
In the late 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if all he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way that the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of World War II, the founding of the State of Israel ignited a fire that could trigger a third world war.
If the international bankers manage to start this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but internationally (just see how people are bitterly divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one wrong causes another harm according to an endless cycle of violence and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world are at the origin of everything?
Here we must distinguish between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as with us, international bankers only offer people their own candidates in elections.
Israel's current prime minister is a typical example of a fascistic politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to start a world war with Iran, which could, due to the country's adherence to the world wide naval cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a world conflict and, given that Iran's control of the world is only 20%.
David Rockefeller said in 1994, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the New World Order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to carry on their hands or foreheads a mark of red iron, that they may neither buy nor sell him who does not bear the name of this fierce beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has common sense counts the numbers of this fierce beast.
This number refers to the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The movie Argo: When everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist students stormed the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have severely shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further exacerbated later by the fiasco of the attempted release of the hostages by force.
The sequestered diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate aroused in the United States a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iranian sentiment.
The Iranian debacle contributed heavily to Jimmy Carter’s defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered a small victory to America.
Just before she was occupied, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rocky cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to do footage for the filming of a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez required the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is a realistic political thriller but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, a betrayal - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen.
The ambiences follow each other: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs from the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no major differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting ceased to elicit ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film not set in his hometown of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed his first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran is "held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity which also suggests the confusion and unpredictability occurring when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictional scenes (the fake shooting team in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to be content with a subject offering in fact few exciting scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It does very well, it sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always so elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is dismissed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the runway are quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
While it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their roles as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, he lets himself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the '70s.
It trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, it does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a public investigation into the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to launch the competition for the settlement or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently been considering adopting a quota of 40 per cent women for the management of large European companies has been at the origin of our decision," said the organiser of the survey, Patrik Nacher, for the Pravo newspaper.
Among the absurdities mentioned is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have had an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of "the EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of the use of reliable mercury thermometers, solely because they contain a relatively small amount of a hazardous substance, or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which has led to an increase in the price of the chickens.
Criticism has also been raised in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the withdrawal from the sale of conventional bulbs.
Quality bananas should have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (so the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its right of veto).
The interests of the lobby groups are also, for example, at the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising inhomogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
Standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some states, claiming that existing directives result in food wastage.
The first prize will be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must appear on inflatable balloons a warning that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to a US survey that says balloons are the leading cause of death of children by choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to blowing in fair trumpets.
We have weird ideas here too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: because of the sensitivity of this theme to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and must instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Laissez Faire", which brings together liberal economists, the server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and risked a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant grants to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund,” said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), in the autumn of 2004.
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and following the so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks that it had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
The grants for grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU), these were to be used, concretely, to draft grant applications granted by Brussels.
The EU declares that "bizarre regulations are rare".
While regulations are often a source of criticism in Member States, many experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's functioning and its overall development deserve rather praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of using EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but that have been imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific denominations for these traditional products (which it does not always win) is a source of intense emotion among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvar<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xBE>ky", for the name "Tuzemsk<0xC3><0xBD> rum" that dates back to the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only products based on cane sugar alcohol, and not beet sugar, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, we find today in the company of world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the marzipan of Lübeck or Parma ham, the biscuits of Karlovy Vary ("Karlovarské suchary"), the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> ("Poho<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0x99>) abo<0xC5><0x88>.
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubick<0xC3><0xBD> pern<0xC3><0xAD>k") and cakes called "Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice cornets" ("ho<0xC5><0x99>ické trubi<0xC4><0x8D>ky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It is not to be a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything went smoothly in our country, I wouldn’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer bear to see how the country has been looted for the past twenty years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and retirement ages are rising.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution to make it change.
And since I am over forty years old and an independent member of no party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to run for president or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back on those who have chosen you?
I've always said I'll get into the battle for the castle according to the results of the senatorial elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument allowing me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are roaring at the bar or in front of our television set, but that we are also trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks the reputation of people and confuse freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was told that I bribed journalists or that I was the adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax returns beyond twenty million [CZK].
For this purpose, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, pressed for the activities of tourist guides to be a liberal profession, I won the case.
The problem is politics: when someone arrives from the left or right with a good project, it is knowingly rejected and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you see yourself as a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
Whether it’s to the left or to the right, it doesn’t matter.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but that we bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or the SDGs, and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you’re a populist?
But does what you said not prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about have been implemented by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won’t survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other choice.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was achieved through pressure from public opinion.
I confess, bluntly, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just got into politics and I'm trying to get the majority support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that one person cannot make a difference, which is why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to run for Senate elections as well.
I met Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote and what did, for the most part, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that can hardly impose change.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to start your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check if each potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have 20,000 in my “transparent” account.
Don't you have any money?
Are you talking about tax returns, which is yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about $60 million.
I have in Prague a lot worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I've always loved James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women, and was fighting evil and abuse.
Do you drive in Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and don't have money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the Republic but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I've already invested two and a half million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that my program is not very interesting.
I have no obligation to pay for this campaign out of pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't afford it, for example, to pay for my son's English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for election.
Are you going to continue your business so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd mute your business?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activities.
For example, my assistant will take over the management of the travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the MVRDV firm prove that true adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To be convinced of this, it is enough to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is funny, it's very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street, tells us.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one goes willingly into one of those naughty libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a rather particular record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of bold stick diagrams and creator of witty and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and entered the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, bewildered and shrugging, Maas, the frightened, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments with a "common dear!"
Here it is, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30-million-euro mountain sprang from the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground parking lot, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and semi-detached houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is how this small dull town, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a town hall of astonishing ugliness, whose white facades invite you to think that they house a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under a cheese bell.
Of course, an elevator transports you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior entirely made of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking for public benches, dogs and little boys and girls who play ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library shelves are located along the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” explains Willy Maas.
We completely upset the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain of books has been cleverly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the dark rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and building engineers do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, project manager with the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
This is how one day we found ad hoc agricultural waste in a Friesian farming company.
In the Netherlands, one millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and you're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons and can then be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates with a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and transforms into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, whose smell evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and potted ficus.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the literary mountain air.
Gifts for the New Soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model project in terms of ecology,” Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is under a glass bell, the sun only illuminates for a short time inside, even on good weather days.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve as a sunshade, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the aforementioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally found soul".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has filled the voids of the library that was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
According to architect Winy Maas, “there is nothing worse than a half-empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV achieved the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
It may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, this is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians’ request for observer state status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it maintains special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so to speak defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
In addition, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans were confronted on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national dossiers.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by its exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position on the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany initially had important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to clash with public opinion, but also with the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to it, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is at least a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany harm its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think the Europeans and the Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think the fracture is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
The United States, on the other hand, has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, publicly defend its position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not so great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Obviously, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not.
They cannot therefore be part of a broader political line and must affirm their singular position.
This is what they are currently doing in the euro area.
In my opinion, Germany will play a locomotive role in the future and push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been tricky.
But in my opinion, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a major role on the international stage, does Germany only want to assume a key role?
Or is it still difficult to take on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country is still struggling to play a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that whenever Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to deal with neighbors and very varied opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but right now, the EU is not filling this gap, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they do not like it, even if it is unpleasant to them and if they are only less appreciated, it is life!
Stephen Szabo is the deputy director of the Transatlantic Academy in Washington, an institute in which academics and policy experts from Europe and North America analyze together the challenges of the transatlantic community.

'Mark Protection' in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the company bearing the trade mark's name cannot file a complaint.
And even if she could, she's not sure she'd win the case.
“It’s becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at Taylor Wessing who specializes in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a workbook containing the registrations made with the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by taking over part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a known fact that the Chinese have become the champions of the world of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: his constituents task him with tackling the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is by this term that women are designated who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch says.
"The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs are in the millions for the sectors concerned, especially with regard to expensive flagship products.
According to the data of the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market for luxury products and the fastest growing.
However, it is not easy to erase dubious trademark registrations and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch mentions the trials in which the court dismissed the complaint, because after a long time, the denomination criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is unlucky, he may even be forced to pay the plagiarism money because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
This is why the Chinese can use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Geely, the purchaser of Volvo, used before a blue and white logo reminiscent of that of BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost to the Hong Kong and Singapore plagiarists who had redirected the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the Trademark Office of CTMO in Beijing admits to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year, the office would have changed from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a regained normality".
Thus, the number of untreated opposition proceedings would have fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, representing a 75% increase from the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Acting is Expensive
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, the OTMC received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, nearly a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and means that China is in the top spot for the tenth time in a row for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly recorded 1.8 billion yuan of registration fee.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarism.
Certainly, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
"It's our fault, because surnames cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munich residents.
Freudenberg won the case in the following two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is required
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is lengthy, exhausting and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs, and the Archives Service has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even offered the opposing party in vain a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
“This is what it means to us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region ensured the exploitation of the unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name Freudenberg in Germany for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilanty is required."
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, they say, to rely on international trademark law, but foreigners should "also register in China everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs can be much higher than those of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or else we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice in their arrival.
Here is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, pumps for ladies and loafers for men seek rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then the vocals of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano -, they rage, enchant and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he conducts the orchestra with his gestures of savage flexibility.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers aged 23 to 69 came, from geneticist in human medicine to home man.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
To be helped to help each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 people infected.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "storyteller" or "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been repeating songs in this foreign language that it brought to Germany to now return to its home region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometers away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or earth and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans because HIV has taken away their parents.
In Esitjeni, the ailments that plague Swaziland can be seen on a smaller scale: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure that nevertheless guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in their mid-30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But barely a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni in an almost professional way.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorrhagia often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men causes at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungi), blennorrhagia, and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany; however, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
A significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections is observed in youth than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25 years.
In addition, in Germany, the human papillomavirus is common in young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis cases has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has declined.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, lower abdominal pain as well as the appearance of pimples and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or through close bodily contact.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners take regular tests.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be prevented.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all the funds that the singers raise thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
“In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well housed, in one of their grandmothers for example.
The gogos, so called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them accommodate up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day on time in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one left is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two chicken coops. With the help of the US health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, because even if the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
“AIDS is a real taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it’s a topic that touches sexuality.”
It is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus across the country.
Condoms can be found on every street corner, Lennartz adds, "but hardly anyone uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi singers travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many inhabitants of the tip of the black continent still know during the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is a sign of recognition such that it not only generates a good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a tear from some formidable border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godparents.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there,” the people there say.
And after a 8,733-kilometre voyage back to Heidelberg, in front of these singers who kick their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, there is also the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers the presence of ice on Mercury
The Messenger spacecraft reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet could reach 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger spacecraft reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 meters.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes any connection between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains Messenger’s chief scientist, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, like small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the birthing room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where stars are born, dubbed "W5", an unromantic name in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope has photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope highlights the colors more.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned it the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest puzzles in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturnian moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without a trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs ever taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the hue, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid nebula in the constellation Sagittarius, several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the glowing heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the constellation of the Snake: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two fused galaxies rush towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use his nickname "Southern Fire Wheel".
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common household dust.
This photo was made from optical and radiographic images taken by different telescopes.
The black hole circle is located 430 million light-years from Earth.
The space telescope has photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosetta Nebula, also permanently create young stars 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and pierced by a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists believe it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was largely composed of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see even further into the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror in this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It allows us to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge and the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented in order to save money.
The diameter still reaches about eleven meters.
The drawback of the economical construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the level of the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its peculiarity is due to its large light-collecting capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists are listening to the universe for extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope, an installation worthy of its name.
Thanks to a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will be composed of almost 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures before 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A giant new telescope is also expected to be built on Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has provided us with images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the mission began.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope’s mission is to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have been indicating the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now certain.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country in which one is still relatively young at 97 years old.
The journey to the Talysh Mountains is of a fierce romanticism.
Around the many turns of the road, the small bus crawls along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it almost feels like in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group Talysh lives, about which not much is known, except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and have a very long lifespan.
Term: Lerik.
The small town is plastered with its too aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not fit at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, because the road has only one lane.
The province has yet to take advantage of the legendary wealth the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision Song Contest, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva said.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region that are more than 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120.
Having a child at 136 years old
But the controversial star of the museum is <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, Müslümov’s age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. By the age of 136, he would still have a daughter.
Would <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about the man of old Central Asia.
"Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence due to the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no registry of civil status.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
Nevertheless, the people of the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the South of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azerbaijani tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks that it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem plausible that the high-calorie meals of Talysh people, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
In Cengemiran, a tiny village close to the town of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a baratte, whose content she tirelessly beats.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
There are also two small children in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadus glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are hidden long dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly Retirement Enough to Live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my entire life, I have never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took charge.
The language of propaganda is astonishing in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father figure of the nation, a man who nevertheless ruled his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-greying son is right: "the elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "rights of man" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution was reborn in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on Sharia law is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with emotion-filled words.
We need to make the transition successful.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he told state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded his powers “in order to save the revolution.”
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a PhD from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles hurriedly drafted by the majority Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour nightly tour of force are indeed troubling to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that the case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word “principles” really mean?
This was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
In any case, this is because a newly introduced article suggests that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia, the al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates throughout the Sunni Islamic world.
This can, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative apparatus, which would lead to the de facto placement of the judiciary under the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation
Another problematic aspect is the probable maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morality and values".
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
It would simply be censorship.
In addition, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
However, the article does not define what an offense is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the wording suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend persons".
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or tell a joke to the detriment of a lawyer?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi puts to the vote and that, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution is Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the Sharia before it comes into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft constitution is “to be thrown into the trash cans of history.”
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to foment a “coup against democracy.”
“If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow it,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
“We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned,” said Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a large prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
“Clean up our country!” they asked Morsi, claiming that “the Qur’an [was their] Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, this is what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said opponents of the draft constitution, like its supporters, had spoken loudly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box which direction the country should take.
The Islamists’ project will certainly win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process that should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood while in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That is why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he said during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all of his powers,” Saeda said.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels neglected, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between different political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could pay off.
A protester in Tharir Square warns: “You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control.”
Norway’s Rakfisk: Is it the world’s most fragrant fish?
The five million people living in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret to the country’s success be tied to the locals’ appetite for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway’s most prized dishes.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
Rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a period - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness sets in and it’s cold, Norwegians gather en masse to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw and then you swallow a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also known as "Rakfisk General", who is responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” adds Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid getting it under your nose, it's not bad - it's reminiscent of a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, prior to the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - undoubtedly with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a complete health system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago richer than Norway, crossed the border to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, albeit fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to be displeased with.
Here, people are unwilling to talk about Anders Breivik, the racist right-wing extremist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the July 22 incident".
The Norwegians have a hard time accepting that in their peaceful country, one of their own might have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," says Anna, our waitress, with blond hair and the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk tray in her hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like most of the people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we do not like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution – everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out of the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and queue to buy myself something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger composed of momentum, a real discovery, it is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel I stay in is one of the many places where rakfisk is served for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps the most odorous of them.
There is a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish, in the Thor-Jürgen mountains?"
"Here are the points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, Will Grant of the BBC is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at the moment.
In a city where traffic jams are rampant in normal times, a security dam has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
Nevertheless, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, which is due to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the midst of a drug war that has already killed about 60,000 people in six years.
“My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Mr. Pena Nieto was governor of the state of Mexico.
A highly populated and sprawling state that encloses the capital. In its land of predilection, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new highways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of cracks.
Plates bearing his name hang outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are counting on him to put in place lasting change,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and the economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects criticism from opponents who reproach the new president for lacking in charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more glaring.
Hidden under the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight drug gangs in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the landfill.
More than 1,000 women have been killed in the state of Mexico while Pena Nieto was governor, a rate far higher than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a place infamous for the number of innocent women killed there.
Detractors of Mr. Pena Nieto, say that at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders perpetrated against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in the face.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold back her tears when she shows me photos of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version mentions a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes that she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says Se<0xC3><0xB1>ora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
As her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been refused.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old scoundrel, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and be quiet.
“But it’s not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions,” she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has made a promise that he will make it his priority during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as president as he was when he was governor,” Olvera said in Valle del Bravo, a member of Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning has not complained of abuse, prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly a victim of during the detention.
The trial concerns Manning’s detention at a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants to dismiss the case on the grounds that Manning's abduction took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors on Friday attempted to demonstrate that Private Bradley Manning — accused of being behind the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. military history — has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits to Manning by officers during her nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, revealed no complaints about her treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a request for the Manning case to be dismissed on the grounds that the abduction took place under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- came a day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officers had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention at Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum solitary confinement from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment his guards had given him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had had within the prison was "very professional" on the whole.
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concerns about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would take care of them, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
“They wrote ‘no problem’ (after addressing the concerns), and yet that didn’t mean I didn’t raise any problems,” Manning said.
Military Judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment in a January 2011 interview with the special commission that met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed indicating a “risk of injury.”
The military said it had been assigned this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for its protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know I was okay, and I wanted to be stripped of that status... so I could enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he considered committing suicide while in Kuwait and fainted once because of the heat.
He added that not being kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was happening in the rest of the world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had were a mattress, blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay on the move, because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the regulations.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that they could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the call.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning said he deduced from his guard's order that he had to drop his blanket that could have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his brief or flip-flops to injure himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he had during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he should be convicted in a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense said Manning plans to plead guilty to the least serious crimes and fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend, with prosecutors arguing that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defense.
If all the charges are held, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two routes: one for the "Mexicans" ("Mexicans"), another for the "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing which line to head for.
I grew up in central California, where I've been called the "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just like what my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became “Mexican-American.”
But here it was Mexico.
And on the land where my grandfather was born, there is no need for a special qualification or line of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in one language or the other.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an indigenous person, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and headed to the "Foreigners" queue.
I thought about that moment of the week when new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risking themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto pledges to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided further details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the point of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans are undermining the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexico-Americans who live in the United States.
Do you want us to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not.
The only reason that explains the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point in our family tree, a person, perhaps a relative or grandparent, did not find any opportunities in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, this person was a typical profile -- dark, uneducated skin from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight that it is the American dream that we are living, and not that of Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they tone us as if we were individuals of inferior strain and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn’t find ourselves stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset by it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels like she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many Mexican-Americans I know do not feel like they are part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to further complicate the relationship, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealthy ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequality, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to do it on your own, amigos.
That's okay.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
- Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old disputes, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started it, dozens of buildings have been smashed to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza have landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full swing.
The Arab Spring has shattered everything, and whether we like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Perhaps their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that it could help them out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to show optimism.
Even though the ceasefire accorded on November 21 continues, this week’s fighting has strengthened supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has run Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing Israelis to give up, even if Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and pushed the 1.7 million people of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a burgeoning regional power, once Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has taken a stand for Hamas; as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas members rejoice and say the Islamist crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its dominance, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and as far as Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is a cousin of Hamas, and its leaders are more easily reliant on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important player that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, supporters of Israel’s hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been reinstated.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears – for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have accused Hamas of being behind the latest wave of violence.
But more importantly, Israel prospered, notably under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared suicide bombings, notably thanks to the separation barrier that encroaches on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality under international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more belligerent party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, has the beautiful part.
Why pamper these fucking Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they led the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out the head.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will prevail; but it may be that the Arab Spring is a game-changer.
Even if Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments settle their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which is a good omen -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is doomed to explode one day in Israeli-occupied territories – much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demographics are exacerbating this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give outsiders the opportunity to stand up for this cause.
Egypt, which must now try to stop the flow of arms to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of ground and a divided Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute far more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has every interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages have come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packets that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law came into effect in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and depictions of children and babies whose illnesses were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
It is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to deter young people from smoking by removing any glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start smoking.
“Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their branding,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pushed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said it would revive black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
“Detrimental consequences will result from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has risen sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost to Australia's high court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only annoyance, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the slice of population targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws banning TV ads, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to conceal cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
“If you work in tobacco marketing and you have only one small showcase to promote your products, the Internet is the place to go quintessentially,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and has bothered to make a video, or if it is an agency-orchestrated marketing campaign?
British American Tobacco Australia said the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than marketing.
The industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions – these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be taken in the course of 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries about similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning pictures mandatory in 2001.
Now, these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The photos don't bother me.
I don't know.
“You take a cigarette and you put away the package,” said Victor El Hage as he bought a package with a picture of a tumour in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said uniform packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
“Before, it took me an hour to unload a parcel, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that’s okay, we stop and we put the key under the door,” he added, raising his arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to reflect on the subject of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development are praising boredom.
It’s perfectly normal for us — and our children — to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, even to nourish creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes, I did.
No, I don't.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a fairly recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But that’s not the case, says Peter Toohey, a professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of “Boredom: A Lively History” (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The boredom goes back a long way,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After browsing through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience of "wanting to do something but not succeeding in getting into a satisfying activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of the boredom, he said, is “the interruption of the attention process, associated with a nasty mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing.”
Boredom can look like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while the two can be linked, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we get bored when it's actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” which was published in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an older experiment in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next door, the too loud sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group didn't hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were bored more than the other two groups – they struggled to concentrate, but didn’t know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or engaging task, a break in attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, “like looking at objects on a editing line, music can help you not get bored.”
In fact, he says, we now know that when you wriggle or scribble, these gestures, often considered signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to pee learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay motionless,” said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a mono-stringed voice, a particularly boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boring Predisposition Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Of the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, the researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a psychology professor at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasted.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teens reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they were not in school.
In contrast, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if today’s boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level,” notably because children and teens don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to pass the time, as studies show.
In contrast, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn’t always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won’t be bored anymore, but he won’t have learned to take care of himself or self-adjustment, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation moves from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to be entertained, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Nor do I think we should criticize him.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should aim for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredom awakens an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate downtime.
“In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when the noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directives for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a college student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Orozco said that one day in September he and a few friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields near the Kansas border, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his consumption - minor offenses, each with a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated like criminals,” Orozco said.
But is it one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offenses involving the use of marijuana have been filed with no consequence.
Police have stopped indicting adults aged 21 and over for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado’s more conservative constituencies have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to indict those who own them.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-licensed marijuana shops in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so quickly that I don’t know what the future holds for us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the chief of police at Aurora, east of Denver.
Washington state regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidance on how to install a licensing system, authorizing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states when it comes to marijuana regulation, first with regard to therapeutic use and now with regard to personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent we could base ourselves on,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal void, during which the licensing system will still not exist, while marijuana possession will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain unanswered: how to balance the state mandate that ensures proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis shops within a 30-km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an accredited cannabis sale business, particularly in the Seattle metropolitan area,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Center, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, police chief Oates in Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and over who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that police should stop indicting people for this type of crime "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates said police will enforce new court decisions that regulate the activity of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and will continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the District Attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession matters, mainly in order to pressure users to have them detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are being charged with other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to prosecute those people who committed an offence that, at the time of the facts, was a recognized offence,” Buck said.
The reactions were complicated even in rural places like Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative in favor of restricted marijuana use.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer bring in adults for possession of limited quantities.
County Public Prosecutor Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to dismiss all marijuana detention cases.
“I don’t feel like I’m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
“This is a cultural barrier” with prosecutors, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents those accused of marijuana use and who speaks out as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve spent a good part of their lives suing people who use marijuana, so are they having a hard time accepting that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol use, Colorado and Washington are on the verge of becoming a case law for legalizing drugs.
As advocates and state officials foresee a new frontier of legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting federal government directives, which still conceives the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Department of Justice will give in.
Despite some publicized arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed medical marijuana businesses to operate in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it’s true that the police are probably not going to break into the doors to seize small bags of drugs, there’s a strong bet that they’re opposed to licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums on the creation of new marijuana businesses, even if it was only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose got a six-month moratorium, and is expected to impose that ban next week.
“We don’t want to end up in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then we find ourselves facing a federal problem,” said City Council member Bob Nicholson.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
There are a lot of questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a Tory (conservative).
It’s not just today’s students who are being attacked for their opinions.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and elder brother studied in what was for me an eminent place of knowledge, a sort of modern-day Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I left this university because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students were having sex in the bedroom next to mine.
Author A.N. Wilson has said in a nutshell that I was gone after being forced to drink from shaved cups.
The truth was less funny.
I fled.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was the victim of racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why talk about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students are experiencing the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's student room (JCR) said they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political views.
They want a representative on the University Equal Opportunities Committee so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which depicted the "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Among them was student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, wears a silver complete and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for setting up higher tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "that there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right.
“This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one who thought so during my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and of paralyzing shyness.
The Conservative Party’s hatred was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title, because of the reduced funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students got to know the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen next.
I found out that teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but that they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy about striking miners, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were being carved into the woods of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was a victim of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, easily got angry.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
Tears burned my eyes.
"I suggest you take French lessons in your free time -- if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year English student, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, kindly.
I'm afraid that's the case.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labour.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A first-year student of philosophy, political and economics who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took up the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They beat each other, don’t they?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Could I only have lived a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who was teaching at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started commuting from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge with my more open-minded family and friends in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was incredulous.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But this is the best place in the world,” he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the dreamy bell tower town.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired of my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a work session directed the following week, when another history professor suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inwardly blushing with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who threw the last nail in my Oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch’s press each week.
My door was locked.
I stayed in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a weeping, weeping chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be the victim of such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but also enjoyed an unshakable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The fashion designer recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his fashion house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until 3 March, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits his personal memories as the trophies of his social rise: from the modest couturier of the northern Italian city of Voghera to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
“At least they don’t crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do,” said Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of beauties of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, also did not forget the charisma of the couturier.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish Steps in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We could see and feel his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, the food, the music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute-Couture week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
Nobility lineage parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves people who are well raised and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous podium of sixty meters wide that offers to exchange the roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade on the podium to admire a "dream public " wearing the main creations of Valentino, such as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his wedding with Aristote Onassis, or the costume that the Viimpt<0xC3><0xA0> wears.
Among this model audience are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a gilette vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-72.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the fashion designer's muses.
“I prefer him to everyone else because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty,” she added.
I really like the colors he uses, they are bright and light up the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and living in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses.
Eventually, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a ruffled skirt, a draped bustier and a fall-off neckline.
"It was a dream come true," Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow said.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the dresses of the dressmaker with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturier calls his seamstresses) to make this dress in ivory silk with inlays of pearls, twelve different kinds of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of high society customers".
Obsessed for years by the nobility's "know-how", Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always caught my eye," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my close friends.
"He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and their health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through the steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living carrying the sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with the air.
After harvesting large sulphur rocks, which weigh in total about 70 kilos, he places them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the summit of the volcano which peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a turtle pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a misstep could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall into the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once upstairs, they fight their way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has operated the volcano since 1960 and, we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would gain in the fields.
“The income of miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the bearer who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulphur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I rammed her for it."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At 27, he spent three of his life defying danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Badminded by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wooden masonry with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop springing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to bearers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they also do not receive one sous of the 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) per camera surcharge, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for animals, not humans,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent wearer who has been working at Kawah Ijen for 30 years since he left college.
Able to carry up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weights of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a goat trail invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik said, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.

Singaporeans blame this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of accessing property.
“Singapore’s population needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words came from an advertisement for mint lozenges, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a poodle in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertisement.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people “fulfill their national duty.”
It is intended only for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that this was a topic that we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, like throwing pheromones or holding speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought to ourselves: what could be more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favor of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy for the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider choice of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family building,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to an increase in the number of singles and delayed marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound with barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in place in Singapore last year experienced its worst electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these housing units are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our treasury.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it would seem that they are not going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that’s why people put it off later,” says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” another 20-year-old tells us.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons for preventing them from having children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is the private domain for children under the age of 16?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, between the ages of 10 and 15, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "the password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
“I won’t reveal my most personal secrets in a post,” said Jorge, 10, as he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone,” he said.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share one of my photos or someone who would do the stupid thing,” he says.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photos, naked people, crimes or write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter followers.
Most of them are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re responding to me, I’m just posting them,” he added.
“Social media is fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly,” he says.
He says he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will also not trust someone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“I don’t care because we have something in common, music for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one gave him advances or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he acknowledges.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today as cyberbullying are not foreign to the young boy.
A close friend of mine was bullied on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it on to a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to configure his account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I were angry or angry.
“Even though I know it’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed,” she said.
Porras notes that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
It is the digital natives, children and young people, who were born with technology.
“We, we’re the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we’re learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion as to what is or is not appropriate to disclose, publish or say at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents privacy is to use questions that make them think.
“Telling them not to do it is useless,” she says.
Next, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a picture of you like a friend you posted?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you’re doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Besides the Internet, everyone has to act with respect, morality and other principles, it has to be the same on social media,” she said.
Surveillance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, says it is essential for parents to read conscientiously the conditions of use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid foundation to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children not to talk to foreigners.
UNASUR Summit ended without Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the summit closed, and then claimed that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by Peru’s President Ollante Humala in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the newsroom.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachés of some of the Unasur governments who were attending the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the “final statement” of the summit, but it was President Humala’s speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on this occasion, although this was urged by the press, it had not disseminated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official website of ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published in March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to put in place secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that decides a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both sides in the Lima trial against Santiago, which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and enforce the verdict that will resolve the disputes we are bringing today before this international court,” Humala said in a statement.
“Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals,” President Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era said, shaking hands with President Humala, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogota Pact by which it agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on the maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been set between South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits".
He said that actions would be put in place to improve “cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better accessibility of medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters.”
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to foresee a better future for our populations,” concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," he said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
Similarly, the outcome document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow it to re-integrate into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart Daniel Ortega the following Saturday in Mexico City to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through an ICJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” President Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with that country,” he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to witness the takeover of the new president of the country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Similarly, in the framework of the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Plan of Action, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
“South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship,” says Rafael Correa.
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, should take an example from Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that Europeans "were killed during World War II" and during other conflicts, "but they now formed almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by the Unasur member countries.
“We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past,” he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian president supported the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of diminishing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, conversely, we South Americans have all signed it.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa says he does not regret his decision, because he did not betray his own principles, but instead respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, “there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected.”
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish justice system, which has demanded that he submit to an interrogation on his territory concerning a suspected sexual offence while "Swedish legislation itself allows for this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious,” he said.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may be deteriorated by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
“It affects anyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the allocation of a safe-conduct that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and he points out that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the hell.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a whole series of proceedings with different European authorities," he said.
And he believes that “if Britain granted safe driving tomorrow, it would be over.”
And if Sweden, as its legislation fully allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr. Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil or perverse politicians but bad journalists for greed, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
From this point of view, he congratulated himself that it was not this kind of journalist "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries dominating Ecuador" and, rather than promoting his re-election, "it would deepen the revolution to continue the way and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality "it destroys the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
It is necessary to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the sound resolution of the dispute over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same tribunal and said that it is "beneficial for Latin America to refer to international fora if the two countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the eventuality of his candidacy as a candidate in the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would retire from public life.
On a personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will retire from politics.
If we ever lose, I will, too.
“It’s my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse of President Chávez's health condition," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed with the HIV-positive test.
"It's as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, which the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to find out about him and his relentlessness was such that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmata.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said the head of the HCG HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as reference that this information was validated in a scientific publication in April of this year.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a deadly disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depended on the level of immune system affection that patients presented at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those not using drugs: up to a rate of 50' for 30 years.
To put it simply, this means that for someone who would be diagnosed positively with HIV at age 25, “as long as they remain under control, they will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age,” he said.
In order to put this progress in context, it must be noted that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60% of the patients identified on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths as of May this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem does not come from access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least, we have never lacked any medications, the problem is that patients get to very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it in advanced stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer screening tests in a massive way, to all people who request it.”
The specialists and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS, who suffered from complications of the cancer of Kapicom.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they're going to die and don't want to know.
“If I’m going to die, it’s better that I break up three times a week,” they say, “that’s not my case.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medications.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but I co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of the World AIDS Day.
If they do the test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in this year 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has embraced the cause of HIV.
The biggest issue is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it is very good, but the result, even today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", posed with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposed redirecting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González responded when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
“This is not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
Numbers in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 for AIDS and 1,317 for HIV).
The State is the 4th state in the country in the number of new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexual, 6% are bloodborne and 2% are perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people are living with HIV, since for each recorded case, there are 4 or 5 people who are unaware of it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico, and the scenario creates a detrimental precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighboring country and with solvency problems.
Thus, it seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the star-flagged country, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenseless in the face of the possibility of an embargo on their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico’s top glass manufacturer to sue the U.S. Supreme Court based on three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge points out that creditors must register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans says the main proceeding is formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intercompany vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries towards the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are half a dozen examples here, among them Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcies.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vault" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro has been blamed for the difficult situation he has been in since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on costs to the country.
For now, the González Sada family company will appeal to the same appeals court for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court.
The most serious is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") detailing Vitro's proceedings under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, noting that this freed him from the agreements signed by the two countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he noted that the country had complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they knock out Vitro and they knock out the country.
General balance sheet
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The proceeding, headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has consistently denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on a transaction carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of the bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They are besieging the Dragon Mart
Gathered over the weekend in a University of the Caribbean amphitheatre, a group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a living area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental project that is partly located on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead.
The government has put forward a requirement from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its English acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it has been a good thing that the Senate itself has condemned this possibility, as it was seen as a violation of freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globetrotter of basketball "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, has traveled all over the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as much knowledge of the history of local basketball as that of Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a brain hemorrhage sentenced him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, a national basketball team player, a manager and a national team leader, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as a football president.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he has lived with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, testify to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves the most are those that remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
“It’s been my best years, the ones I’ve enjoyed the most because I’ve had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967 onwards, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
It's been many years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great director, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a manager here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a tough player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it?"
This is how to start with Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was pleased with the championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's duties in the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we were 4th and where we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn’t made us play the last game again, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite is that of the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and beat up the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the World Cup of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not be the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success in the federation?
To have been one of the most glorious times of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to have put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce only play in their area and only play teams from other corners of the island in the national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of compulsory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch clips from my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren, and from time to time I watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide for the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., the production house of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved the most again,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on that Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, his press secretary Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and he had admitted to drinking heavily for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and had undergone a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had become known on television as an ordinary guy in the NBC television series "Jinny of My Dreams" from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a seductive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film roles include critically-received roles in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the delightfully detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and their relatives aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", coined to keep the suspense going around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has spawned speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment show in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had garnered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reason to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
“I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R.,” Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge man, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
Recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in the works, the channel said.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated about how Hagman's death will be incorporated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who gained fame with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the stage of New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I haven’t written anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told reporters at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence, I come with them when they come to have surgery and then," he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer them some comfort, like, “Don’t be afraid, it won’t be easy for a little while, but it’ll be fine.”
He has also been an anti-smoking activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charme decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing there an irresistible hook: the end of the "great count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people refer to as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charmed had no idea what to expect over the next few months: catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a tax chasm that some have dubbed the “Debt Armageddon,” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where late-day Christian theorists thought the apocalypse would unleash.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I’ve ever known,” Professor Charmed told his students at Rutgers-Camden University, New Jersey, this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we tell it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human behavior.
If nuclear weapons were to fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply titled “The End of the World.”
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world doesn’t disappear,” Professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses have proven to be quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-level students, consisting of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, claims to have watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a course that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students questioned, let alone a professor, told us to believe in the end of the world date of December 21.
“Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old senior from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I concede that there is an apocalypse-related anxiety in Western culture, dating back centuries, that causes people to react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a surge in these speculations.
“In other places around the world, people don’t think about that,” he says.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded promptly when asked if he knew we were giving classes here on "the end of the world."
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he said, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the Last Judgment, and he claims that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or philosophizing about the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they would go to "end of the world" parties.
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
