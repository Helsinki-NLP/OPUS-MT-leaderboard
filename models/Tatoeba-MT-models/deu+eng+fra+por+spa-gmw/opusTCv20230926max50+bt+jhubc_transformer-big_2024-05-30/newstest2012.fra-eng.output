Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the proposed annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
MEPs rejected in second reading the draft amendment to reduce penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for concluding an a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not final and the court is due to decide on the sentenced woman's appeal in December.
Tymosenko describes the regime's judgment as political revenge and has provoked a process of suspicion of court bias also in the west.
The proposal to repeal paragraph 365 of criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The liberation or Libyan rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but whether they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary Sharia law and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a crime-free country because for a robbery you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, any non-respectfuls of the faith are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya there will be such an order as we cannot imagine and as we surely would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best, and would probably not be beneficial to Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors accepted the help with gratitude from the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with each attack.
So when it comes to seeking the victors in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our politicians turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders".
Without land occupation, oil companies will easily have access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of uninterested protection of human rights.
As long as we prevent these followers of the Sharia.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the sights of investors.
A tornado of statistics hit Europe on Tuesday.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for the 3As.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market breaks all records.
Investors are looking not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, France's by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany performed better than expected (up 0.3% from the expected 0.1%), however France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (which was the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics it is confirmed that we are heading towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5% during the third quarter but stagnated during the last quarter.
The German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter according to forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The euro area and EU economy grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which corresponds to what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
Spanish and Italian bond yields are climbing to critical limits.
Problems are beginning to be felt in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Czech bond yields remain below 4% as the situation worsens in the region.
Voices are being heard in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance .
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won in Montenegro 1-0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The football performance has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to super Cech and goalkeeper Petr Jiracek 1-0.
Czech football has defended dearly with a good deal of luck in the second part of his qualification and will not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with detailed reportage.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech representation also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its qualification to the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second half because of a precise Czech defense.
The victories of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European Championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football crate.
From the first few minutes we played a war football.
Both teams were difficult to assemble combinations and the game focused mainly around the center line.
The pressure of the national footballers did not break through the Czech defense, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred high school students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Isfahan have created a human shield Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Isfahan where uranium is processed.
They have expressed openly that they will defend their country’s illumination program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) noted in its latest report that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon outside the site and then wished the death of the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear program, the targets would be not only Isfahan, but also the Natanz site where the uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: do not eat breakfast and take cold meats for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, 9% of schoolchildren will have above-average weight and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families that have an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment in which the human being evolves and the models that surround him is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages are found 50% more often than in families of children of normal weight.
19% of obese people had French fries at dinner, according to the survey conducted with an awareness-raising action "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of small and large, sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% responded that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Investigation of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and 900 students from Czech primary schools participated.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is not a coincidence", an action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from the sixth to third grades have enrolled in this project.
One of the determinants that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight, even obese children, is the lack of a correct diet and not enough exercise.
“Only half of the children surveyed reported eating breakfast five times a day – in case of lunch, snack, dinner, which is one of the basic principles of a good diet,” said one of the survey results.
No breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes a few basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of students’ families eat at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that families of obese children consume more often unhealthy fries.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sugary drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children surveyed exercise regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your food
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet based on options proposed according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
“The most alarming is, in particular, a high preference for sweet lemonades,” the survey results indicate.
For lunch it was pasta that took the first place right in front of white meat.
The children did not want starches at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Heading to health
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a control of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet," the results of the survey said.
The most striking was, for example, with regard to sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
The children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (the Czech specialty of bread flour balls or potatoes).
The stylist should also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry that there was a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn’t thinking about what would happen next.
The presentations by three professionals of the specialty, the dress of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final exams and the more practical exercises and information await us.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it is really "drunk".
This time we have with the director Alenka (in the course there is no boy) dealt with how to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically cushion wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to beautifully emphasize the character and also not to dress too vividly for types of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a thin waist.
For example, if there is a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that skirts or pants do not fit at all, it is worth having it made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is invaluable.
In a bespoke skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly slips, winds and does not hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously a lot of examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I’m also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there are too many.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, the type of personality fashion as well as its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who you may know about the Victoria Secret campaign.
In my heart, it’s a pleasure, because it’s better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who’s gained almost a hundred pounds lately (please don’t take my statement completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work the graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking also about the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physique but creates for example the productive pages in magazines (on given products the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us about all this.
But that, until Sunday.
The stylist should have a general vision.
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse appearance to the Saturday session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion graphic designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with just one outfit in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench coat that has to be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with pumps and take a picture like a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
“Play with it,” he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly".
“You can then start to contravene it,” Jakub said.
Finally I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have much more variations of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen pages (so a dozen models) I must be ready to "retail" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on that in the course of creating a model.
The fact that the image and the style sometimes do half the success was confirmed to us by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who is not a super singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains chilling.
And known faces sometimes consider them useless (it is enough that I know something but what I seem to move to the second rank).
And if someone gets a styling done by us, then we have to count on the fact that he dictates us with a high probability a completely different (smaller) size than he actually has.
Then we only have to browse Google and make sure the boulevard news mentions the celebrity in question, if she has lost weight or increased weight etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He needs to communicate with the people he dresses and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
Know how to guess people, not to flatter yourself, to keep your opinion.
“When a manager asks you to sort out her closet and fill it with new items, you can’t throw it all away and say, ‘My God, what a horror.’”
"You'll find some things that you'll find pretty and he you'll advise with what to wear them," says Mario.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, hair removal rollers or nanny pins, there is also nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of staple) they could not be quilted.
So that we were not just people who listened but who tried something in a practical way they taught us how to properly resemble shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We did not have the right to touch the scissors so as not to inadvertently injure ourselves.
So we really need skills.
Mario was pleased when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting isn't for my girlfriend.
This is just a short summary of what we learned during the second weekend of the course.
I am beginning to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed by a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it into a routine morning commute to work.
It fulfills to some extent everyone's ambition but it's useless if no one wants to do something else.
The new subtitled part The Run produced high expectations before its release.
He promised to take a new direction with the already aging Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from the playable parts that would not only count with points.
So we were curious what the added passages will be in which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole pulls down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them starts to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on a different route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite well distinguished from each other and are interesting.
The player does not feel for a single moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are also pretty, even if the graphical technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
This is not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in heavily snow-covered mountains is very visually pleasing.
The events are more often than not adorned with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly diminishes your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
In addition, the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the required number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you race against the clock (classic duel with the stopwatch) and then again another duel with an opponent awaits you.
From time to time you also have the police that enters the game and tries to make the situation difficult for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
Rather, it is an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by tapping the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
As a result, it is good because this element is not likely to interfere and, in the context described above, is placed in the elements that adorn the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go somewhere else.
But although we can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything is ok.
Problems begin to appear after a while.
At the difference of the driving model, that of collisions is not yet at the point.
We do not expect complicated deformation and collisions from this game, but when you do not have, during a collision with any object, the slightest idea of how your car behaves, it is therefore not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car goes into crazy turns.
Or find yourself in crumbs.
Thanks to the reboot system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The reboot is done so that when you broke your face or went out in the scenery the game takes you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
It is therefore more a tool, in case something is not happening properly, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes reboots do not help and you have to find the solution by remembering the piece of itinerary in question.
The main drawback of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain corners that you have to go through in a certain way otherwise it does not go through.
Otherwise you will encounter "civil" vehicles in the same configuration at a given location as you arrive first, fifth, 5 seconds ahead or one minute late.
What annoys are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and circumvent them or brake them.
It does not matter if you go to meet him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
Throughout the game, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you always have the same opponent ahead of you in the same place.
This annoys you the most at the end of the game when you ride on a long deck in the opposite direction.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of the other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide a lot of times.
It can be understood that the purpose of this game is to make something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's a pity because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it doesn’t matter if it’s because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You need to pay attention to gas pumps on the routes as you can change cars there however most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, large American engines for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic twists on highly technical lines, for example on laced roads in the mountains.
And the challenge mode, which are races in particular places you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of the story.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
It connects online with the Autolog feature, which compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the hardest strokes to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/h (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap.
At the editorial we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought about the creation of this game or if the authors really take us for idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really great.
What is embarrassing is that in more extreme situations, the imagery does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer of use to you.
The sound is good and the track is a choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the youngest audience a new soundtrack has been created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for the music.
Need for Speed: The Run is really confusing.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game feels like it's not finished.
The fun is really good but get ready for mistakes to hit your eyes with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
“I didn’t expect such a tough war.”
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all the players get used to their new role," Miléna Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law, the Czech ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various organs of the EU and their relations in such a understandable and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University might envy her, she showed how she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the very beginning there was criticism that he is dull, that he is a round-of-leather, that he can't fulfill any mission and I have to say that he has taken everyone's breath away because he holds his role to perfection."
“He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe.”
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What phone number should I call?", thus as an important step towards the unity and greater readability of the Union's policy towards states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our syrecky (baked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also mentioned the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success two years ago.
The Czechs either resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It called the fall of the government a very negative one and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "activity has been in full swing" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved today.
In addition, the new seven-year budget of the Union must be approved, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be slim and cost-saving, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For a understandable Europe".
“I really don’t like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that no one understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels nobody makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or that nobody has forbidden us to make syrecky.
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe is waiting for us
According to the Ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, she said, stems from several factors, such as the shyness of our candidates, their inability to write a cover letter and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then underlined the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me, 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this group from Visegrad still doing?' and he is not happy at all."
According to Ms Vicenova, in the near future, new tough fiscal rules are waiting for the member countries.
It is the concept of a two-speed, if not multi-speed, Europe that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
“We have countries in the eurozone and others outside the zone.”
“We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation.”
In the first place, it was said that the countries that want it and those that do not want it are cooperating between them remain in their corners.
"There will be a lot of institutes of this type and there will be a really two-speed Europe," said Vicenova.
From this point of view, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all themes with an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just the members of the eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the term that most closely expresses the IBM strategy, the closest would be "the long term".
For a wide audience IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and yet since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm’s chief executive, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that a large number of global problems can be solved as long as people are eager to think.
His slogan "THINK!" became the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was the basis of Watson’s carefully crafted company culture.
For us IBM means long-term thinking of continuous forward-looking movements.
IBM survived a hundred years because it always remained true to its core values and yet was not afraid to change everyone else around it.
This has allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more "delayed for the anniversary the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, took care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic – IBM people were the only among the first American employees to have paid vacation, insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-crafted system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was at first brilliant at discovering talent—as one of the first firms to have abolished all forms of discrimination and so could have a choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has worked at IBM for thirty years and currently holds the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has done so-called jamy, online brainstorming from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
No wonder he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company that assures it a secure position in the field of business.
“From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm,” said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, professor of economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology,” said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating that market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue", as it is familiarly called in the United States in view of its slogan - in a hundred years it has grown to become one of the largest companies in the world.
It is obviously the most versatile technology company - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of products from the server to nanotechnology.
She holds numerous patents from all U.S. technology firms and five of her employees have received a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ATM, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM was the second largest tech company by market capitalization (the first being Apple) this year with $220 billion, when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed the bet on an OS/2 own operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
“From the moment your business is built on the movement ahead, you can’t emotionally stay stuck to the past,” notes Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft competitor who at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for one-fifth by software and hardware, have a predominant place.
However, still in 1990 it was with more of the participation motié the strongest hardware representative.
Starting in 2000, IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, and in that period invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues in investment and even from 2008, when it first surpassed the new financial crisis.
IBM is negotiating according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Does it now appear that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM stock has prospered from 2008 in rocket 120 percent, the company's net profit continues to grow.
The IBM logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From slices of cheese to thefts in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help lead the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of the firm - it is on Watson's ideas that the identity and culture of the company rest until now.
Watson ran the firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, revenue multiplied to $9 million and the company began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable for the firm that after 40 years of leadership it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM people and computers helped NASA guide flights into the cosmos – on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 came on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but bought the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
The strategy that has succeeded at IBM over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and city management.
As far as commerce is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smart Commerce" platform that helps salespeople manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-level research and development team that deals with speech recognition.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53 years old) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from her pink dream and return home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for the future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova gave Bartosova summer asylum in her home, she had no idea her couple would not stand.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not repel the singer.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
With time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye to him forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in who her husband sleeps with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome her on the doorstep of the house.
“He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common home, no one will put him out.”
"He will no longer be my beloved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova said, showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
“I respect my wife’s decision.”
"I will stay with Iveta and I will not change."
"My wife has set up a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy."
"With Darina we talk in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar told Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he will not stop it.
“We’re not sleeping together and I’m not interested in where she’s going, with whom and if she’s having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," Joseph said.
Women’s Worst Vices: Does It Affect You, Too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their “sleeves.”
My dear ladies, you will learn in the following lines of the feminine vices that manage to pump the blood from the veins of men.
Purchasing
Does your half make any comments that you are dependent on purchases?
Should you buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of sale?
In your case, we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist the window-windows of clothing stores, to look for nice clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for the man.
Just remember how many times you've told your spouse he's waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too big"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 pounds - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don’t these phrases remind you of something?
Oh, yeah?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the issue that you should stop caring about yourself, but a lot of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about their appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more the frequency of these complaints increases and the more women become poisonous.
The scoop and the cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Washing windows, vacuuming, cleaning floors, dusting, picking up the bathroom - and that twice a week.
Do you make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they have soiled the sink, dirtyed the glass of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of Sape
"Put this worn sweater in the trash."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner in this way several times a day, you are really going to break it down.
It’s obvious that you don’t think badly you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if men knew, women wouldn't have to do so much undermining work...
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persiflation but also insults against someone are also characteristic of some women.
Women are particularly committed to relationships and are thus happy to deal with topics such as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us lets out a little harmless snooping here and there.
The hand on the heart is a peculiarity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persiflen, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their surroundings - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped by their participation in the victory of Philadelphia
Hokey forward Jagr participated twice in Philadelphia's win during Monday's NHL game on the Caroline ice and is again at the top of the Czech productive players for the contest.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made yet another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the match.
After the match, Jagr told reporters across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
“I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick.”
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal of the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault of the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the paddle and presented it to the scorer Maxime Talbot.
A second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second half belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds turned a fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
“I don’t want to say he’s the best player in the league but he’s really one of the top three,” Jagr said of his center.
“I never thought I would play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him.”
“I’m really happy with that.”
“I want to play on him.”
“All these years in the NHL the other players in the team have tried to play on me, now it’s my turn,” Jagr added.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she ends with a difference of one goal.
Matt Read did not rule out any other complications that ended up two-on-one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He taped on the pallet, I picked up speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," describes the last goal of the match from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he left in second third because of an injury in the upper body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-goal lead lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
It is the fact that the backline was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost points because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It's shit."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's nothing to do, it's like that," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement by replacement was not enough and we could not resist."
“We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area.”
For this we had limits, "added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender took part in the thirtieth attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 games lost.
How Travel Prices Have Changed Since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered travel especially to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A major exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have a leaning towards the west and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In case the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter otherwise individual travel was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however it was necessary to queue all night with a sleeping bag or have a "good acquaintance" within the travel agency.
And even after that it was not yet won.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to the "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable, however, and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the currency agreement (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs’ travels have been undergoing a major revolution since 1989.
Although until 1989 the holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were maximum, the Czechs spent last year abroad 4 million days of holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 90s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short-term visits especially in Austria to Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip was at that time to take with you your own canned food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech crown which finally allowed our tourists after decades of being able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average salary increased which caused around the year 1997 another important moment.
As a result of growing demand for travel, since 1997 travel agencies have started to prepare tours with air charter links that through contracts have tremendously reduced costs compared to what was before.
In the late 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world, apart from the US, which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant warm countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully rank in the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time again in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person on holidays abroad including the associated charges.
The General Assembly must find its President but it risks ending in a situation without a solution "one pat"
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without a president and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hasek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic is not yet known after another General Assembly that is due to take place Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the voting rules to be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the direction of Czech football.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek did football go back to differences between the Association chambers that could not agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on September 16 when it came to choosing a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who has the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, apparently, statutory representatives or officials with full powers.
In this one point there has been a partial agreement since then with the help of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Divergences still continue over the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not brought anything to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the focal point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of disagreement lies in the following fact: either proceed according to the statutes or find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model, in the third round, the candidate who has received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate wins.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to be withdrawn so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers wins.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to whom it would be better not to change the rules and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the rules of the elections established according to the statutes benefit Pelta the most among all the candidates.
"I want to vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any silly ideas imagined by a representative as during the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and in a constructive way.
"Today's qualifying for the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will once again be on a wave of happiness and there is more enthusiasm for cooperation," adds the Jablonec officer who among the three has the greatest experience in directing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This may again cause a blockage to the General Assembly."
"I still hope that sound reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but who can tell if the whole football direction will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight, in which Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, among others, were to travel to Podgorice, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of reprisals.
In the end, it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parties within the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union that must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the head of the footballers of Plzen Tomas Paclik had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asks for a new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (AFRT), he would not be campaigned for this high office.
“If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I don’t run for election.”
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl to precisely try to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the AFRT head who would be given a favorite for this election.
Paclik also points out that if he wins the election he would hold this position of President only until 2013 year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but who is not related to the world of football.
“I’ve talked to people who have the profile,” he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
“I’d like to change that image,” he added.
What, it is said, is mainly disturbing Paclik, is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of counter-fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of delegates ' the General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to hold this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying trader, it would be even less favorable for football," Paclik said.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta’s name was pronounced a few years ago during an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta got out without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell the Plzen club".
In the event that Paclik triumphs in Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco, thinks the same.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
“He has great capabilities.”
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able to."
"I do not put my nose in what I do not know," said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he spoke out for the cancellation of the Arbitration Commission with Ludek Macela, who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to lead private firms and that he also runs since last year the club of Plzen that celebrated with his support last May its triumph in the first division.
“I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it.”
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups, for example, who tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to situations of bad taste," Paclik said.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power of lobbying for high-level policies would result in more money from the gambling tax for sport.
"This is one of the key points that the new president should be dealing with."
“If it’s the gambling tax as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money is going,” he said.
Paclik does not take his current liaison with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself says that the AFRT president should be "above the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Prague's Dukla.
"That's not the ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to anyone if I have to come back a year and a half later," Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should end pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidate Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end in the future the quarrels over the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic ahead of Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that today's success of the football performance should calm this guerrilla war before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not take place, promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial means if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly, and this delay of two months could well allow him to defend his vision of football management and present it in a broad context.
“People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday.”
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for a large number of years at Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That’s also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved that were not perfect as all of them realized."
“If there weren’t all these different interpretations, we would have had a president since September,” Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the full attention of the delegates.
“If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and I am ready to take responsibility for it in case it doesn’t work.”
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes in terms of his legal training and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He also hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He has been in football for a year and has already had some successes."
“However, his attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign.”
"That's also why some now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to national representation.
It should be a football show.
"And I would also endeavor to finish all the affairs that begin with that of the Bohemians or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all of football," the 46th candidate told the Czech news agency CTK two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there is an understandable nervousness since there is no management.
Although there are catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk for nothing.
“If there’s one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round, we’ll get over it.”
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there's a new leader at the helm," Pelta said optimistically two days before the likely day for his official career.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership AFRT will start working hard
"If the current Vice President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people, it appears.
Rajchl promises, however, that in the event he is elected, we will begin to work hard.
He wants systemic changes and making the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work started by his predecessor Ivan Hasek.
“As president, I want to take care of football in its entirety.”
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and youth-friendly football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for CTK.
"I'm a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each member takes care of a specific area."
“And I’ll be distributing tough missions so that football can take a big step forward.”
"A lot of people will not be happy because it will be about starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He said, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
About me, we know I work 20 hours a day.
“But I need to know if it’s worth it and if I’ll have people behind me who will keep putting sticks in my wheels and cast doubt on each of my actions,” he said.
"A lot of people have told me that I shouldn't give up because they would give up too."
“This is a trust I can’t betray,” he said.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"For the last two years there's been a lot of de facto work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said with fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
“I believe in systematic work and that’s something Mirek Pelta doesn’t know how to do.”
"Behind him are people who were playing football in such a way that it would be only for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but certainly not for enduring any of them."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it, not just those who have been chosen.
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I'm ready to do my best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, whose winners would end up in the first division."
"There would be no situation like currently with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, president of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I am constantly feeling the support of the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its vice president, and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who plans to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, negotiations on contracts with televisions and on the gaming law.
On the contrary, he says that the fact that the Association is not united is a common fault of all.
While he says about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose its credibility", he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has something to offer to football.
“No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year.”
"If elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and not make any noticeable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to waste his successes," said Rajchl, who was evaluating his rivals.

UFO-optic paddleboards, magnificent Budapest swimming pools: Whoever travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after having toured the city or made a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soda water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there was one thing she shouldn’t miss in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Stretched out on her back in the water, she watched the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten marbles that awaited her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If an indoor swimming pool pleased her, she immediately noted in her notebook all the details worthy of interest on the type of construction and on the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she has presented them in her book already published: "Badefreuden" (Badefreuden). The municipal indoor swimming pools of Munich, the historic bath palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia, respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
Meder explains that she doesn’t have much interest in the sport but she feels attracted to the water in a totally different way.
It’s irritating that swimmers have to just gaze at blue tiles and get comfortable with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe the enchanting scent of spruce forests or can hear the squeal of cheerful birds in the park.
“I once wondered why swimming pools should always be so ugly,” she said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double reinforces the architecture
A dive in a swimming pool and volatile sauna oils – a wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all the senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are presented optically in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, stepping stones.
The small image volume "Badefreuden" makes an interesting 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, it found waters containing nitrate in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of baths whose basins are filled with water containing alkali and (Városim) in a seberi and (Városim Ter).
On the other hand, the heated outdoor pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While from a roof of the Zurich bath one has the whole city in his eyes, one can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which one can observe the animation on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: The Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
The smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the <0xC3><0x81>rpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emanates a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be in a health spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slip into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded lot.
The bath designed by the architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking out the window of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she observed the blossoming of weeds between the tiles.
She observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad’s thermal spa palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only Neo-Roman elements that come out since its design in 1844 but also a Moorish hall in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favorite bath of pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great yield to fuse such different building styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
The German bank examines in detail the speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on commodities?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the world’s poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as corn and wheat.
Two-thirds of the respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue of business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann points out in this article that stock market speculation on global commodities drives prices up and that banks share an accomplice to global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against the head of the Deutsche-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even if the big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts meanwhile share the opinion that bettors have detached themselves from the offers and demand - and benefit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann reacted differently to the criticism of American competitors: he promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "No case is worth putting at risk the good reputation of the Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the Foodwatch-Report accusations.
The examination must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the board of directors of Deutsche Bank must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the commodity market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his image
Foodwatch chief Thilo Bode hailed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way how much the banks of today are harming the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly obligated today.
“Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation,” Bode said.
“It doesn’t matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it’s about hungry people or whether Deutsche Bank’s reputation is at stake.”
Ackermann’s awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO of the group wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the chairman of the board of directors will not change anything to what is planned within the board of directors.
It could improve its brand image with an abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Only eleven percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money is injected into commodity speculations.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their surroundings, 49% said that they would consider terminating their account to change banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The pavilion that has moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with highs, lows and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won awards, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruin.
It is now open again and serves as an exhibition hall.
If one is enthusiastic about modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass sheds, its bright and bold looks and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of the Austrian architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World's Fair in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its light and suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to this day as an important step in contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian World's Fair.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and its adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion project as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the south station of Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suited for a museum - no walls to hang artworks, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has decayed more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
On Tuesday evening the Belvédère museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance from any point of view.
The new start was carried out by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian gallery Belvédère in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she has carried out particularly well the works of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, she has obtained public funds and sponsorship.
Except for contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name have been exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office is to be built there.
Strict monitoring, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had sensibly transformed and expanded the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and that for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" place where he had seen "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of its move to Vienna and by its change of use.
During the current transformations, there were big problems: the building was "a pit of energy", says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was laid and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
Thermal bridge beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a dimmed light panel between the house and the road ensures the lighting, a bridge leading to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors remained, the house is painted in a rust-protection shade of red-brown color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the competent authorities for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and that also please the monuments protection office," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to a raw floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, “which came from Brussels,” Krischanitz said recently, a typical “Drop-in-the-City” story.
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands precisely the newly planned "Central Station district", with offices and apartments.
And another chance may be coming: the 21st century House could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz construction, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as it is said, she is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn is planning a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a crisis plan, which aims to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the winter season and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more in this regard this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported beforehand, citing an internal crisis plan of the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago, train station chief Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in case of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been waiting for approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had a lot to do for years, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked significantly more often at the workshop, after an axle break has taken place on an ICE in Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the US.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is something new in the US: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this giant of the sector catches up in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Markets Regulator has made a series of accusations to the big banks that it has induced cooperative banks to make false promises regarding the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents have lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and have driven banks down.
"We are satisfied that we have been able to find a solution on this matter without the parties starting a court case," a Deutsche Bank spokesperson said in New York.
In comparison, the Bank did not acknowledge any fault.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the United States and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is attempting to repair the multi-billion-dollar damage.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also taken other major banks apart and in the summer it has referred to the Court JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even if the events are already a few years old, at the moment it is blowing a storm wind on the US banks.
Investors and supervisory authorities have brought numerous recourses to seek redress or to punish defaults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
It accuses 18 major international banks, two U.S. state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac of having had an advantage in kind in mortgage deals of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also has to file an appeal with the FHFA, a number of transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities are asking that Frankfurter answer for "substantial losses", but without quoting a specific sum.
Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett Increases $10 Billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, is investing colossal sums in IBM’s IT company.
Since March, it has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT IT companies, given that the long-term evolution of companies shows only bad prognoses.
He has, however, read IBM’s reports and changed his view on investments in this sector.
He had already understood much earlier that IBM primarily offers IT services and systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knightly attack in the world of finance.
Therefore, the IBM IT business now grants itself the right to be called "Mr. IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a shareholding of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM has never heard of this commitment so far.
He congratulated management, which had ensured reasonable profits even during the economic crisis.
“You did a great job,” Buffett said strategically.
IBM has for some time relied on lucrative IT services as an "exploitation of accounting centers".
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided tech companies.
He says he only invests in the companies he understands the business of.
But on the contrary, Buffett is tackling rail freight, lubricant manufacturers or machinery.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a number of major groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and established it as one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to smart investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
This is why he is a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Orakel of Omaha".
Following the announcement of Buffett’s investment, IBM shares rose by one percent on the stock exchange.
Big Blue, also known as IBM, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and counts with Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn’t want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000 to 2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population reacted with fear and concern.
For many German-Turks, the specter that was long thought to be dead is reappearing: since the Mölln incendiary attacks in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
The fact that there is xenophobia in Germany has never been discussed.
The right-wing extremist network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to the bloody ideology", "This was the title of the internet publication of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper Sabah, on the other hand, points out that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and worries that the German authorities could be involved in the far-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany responded in a reasoned way: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony for the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that the cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
Reports from some Turkish media make the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
Thus the German publication of the "Hürriyet" is not deprived of deriving from it unequivocal conditions.
"It's starting to stink," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made a significant contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The police's action was viewed very critically on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently debated the success of their research.
Why it did not come to the minds of the German authorities much earlier to do research in certain suspicious far-right circles, the authors are astonished.
More than one is ready for at least rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be cluttered, there will be nothing left for the migrants but self-defense and armament."
“This will be the best self-defense.”
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," Selen wrote.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in jeopardy, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply ingrained in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, to which mistrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have sharpened the feeling of the US in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mostly the failure of German politics after the attacks that the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the Solingen fire he sent a telegram of condolences to the head of the Turkish state, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes the local Turkish population produced.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax burdens.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deep the mistrust of many Germano-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate far-right terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time around.
The scandal bank on Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and patina in the meantime from one crisis to the next.
It's a German who has to lead now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his dramatic departure from the head of the Bundesbank, we learned in July that he would hold an almost as spectacular position in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the big Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, praised Switzerland for its beauty and the UBS for its recently obtained solidity and passed on friendly remarks on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded in the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank’s security systems and blew up about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS is now considered to be suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised of the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the administration already in May - not in 2013, as the bank said on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is becoming difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
All at once he assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long deserved the title of "the largest scandalous bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is huge on one side – until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from one scandal to the other.
Nothing, it seems, spares the so proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, she had combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become, in the area of banking investment, a very large bank.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the largest banks in the world.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich recounts: "I have always taken the UBS as a model of good banking in front of my students."
“In today’s perspective, you’re wondering, how could I have just been so wrong?”
He was deeply mistaken.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not going round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew surprisingly, who until then was considered a top intellectual as well as a brilliant banker.
A few months later it was felt as to why he had left.
The bank’s division had exploded with sub-prime documents and had to cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and crossed it.
For this, it did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was silenced, to the point that one has never even learned its name.
But this was only the first shot.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to announce again losses of billions, the chairman of the board Marcel Ospel, who was still the second highest-paid board in Switzerland in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the catastrophe followed: the UBS was, given its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought from the UBS tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation has given six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 was more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
“We weren’t able to save the UBS again,” said Geiger, a bank researcher.
After the first disaster, the second followed.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared ready to publish the data of the wealthy clientele, who may have defrauded the tax with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in repayment of unjustified profits from these operations with a fine increased.
Thus the UBS more or less published that it had helped with tax fraud.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with wealthy customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
In just a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax evasion.
And, as there was a somewhat calm return, and as was thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate story of title dealers: a single title dealer burned 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banking it still does not seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is certain: "The problem with UBS is that it does not have control over risks."
However, it was exactly the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long assumed their function, that of becoming the custodian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could collapse well beyond the Alpine Republic.
The treasures of the Swiss banks had become the symbol of unwavering reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the Swiss private bank - it is only a little bigger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewelers like Tiffany's can be found here among the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss bankers have lived here for centuries: from the national bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We reach the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or another discarded from the market - or betrayed the two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would rather not read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss have nothing to say.
"And yet they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the sub-prime jungle as the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS".
With up to about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks formed a huge group together.
A bank was set up, which was already too big for small Switzerland – and has been growing steadily.
What helped was that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS completed: a rich but lethargic bank with asset management in Zurich as a strong point and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized one.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favorably access to a lot of money, with which they were able to spin a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, formerly chairman of the board of directors.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team,” says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who made his way to the top with learning the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end on Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger says.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance happened before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the executive meetings during which the Wuffli group leader always uttered the same watchword: dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the "League Tables" rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all, the UBS wanted to go upstairs.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the case of foreign exchange and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisors, who were responsible for it, however, pointed out a weakness: in international interest operations, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS has gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
Thirsty for growth, it is both the bank itself and a management fund created before it in the U.S. sub-prime investments that have invested.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed on valuable documents based on U.S. mortgages – but also kept risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a long time to go down.
“Again in the summer of 2007, while the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after another had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than previously thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and are so far bankrupt.
The one who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He must find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
Bank researcher Geiger already has an idea: stop investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank does not (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday the head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has established itself: it must sustainably manage the affairs of the UBS, the Bank of Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
He said publicly only until now that he was going to look for an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The threat of a recession in Europe over the weekend has discouraged U.S. investors.
The change of government in Athens and Rome remained without impact.
Industrial production on the continent has stifled hopes for a stabilization of the debt crisis in its germ.
The general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens could not be imposed.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass I had only half filled last week, not half emptied - but now the problems are once again in the foreground, said Mark Luschini von Janney Montgomery Scott.
Especially the financial values were on the sales sheets.
The default values of the Dow-Jones-Index recorded a loss of approximately 0.6% at the close of the markets at 12,078 points.

As announced by the statistics office Eurostat, companies produced in September, 2% less than in the month before.
U.S. investors have expressed themselves skeptically: “We are not an island, but dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman management.
Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness coming from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "It is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was from his point of view too early to invest in bonds coming from European states and banks.
Instead, Warren Buffett threw a decades-old principle into the winds and entered the American tech industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the stock price of this traditional group, and allowed it to score almost more than 1%, against the trend of business management.

Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, freaks are considered a "bird problem" but experts say these highly intelligent animals have not been driven out of cities for a long time.
Some love them, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have belonged to the city for centuries, but in many communities complaints from residents are increasing because of the dirt and noise of animals.
An antidote against the "bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first Ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to chase frogs from cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
They are looking for alternatives in cities.
Protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected frogs: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large settlements with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had gained negative publicity because of the crow massacre in this region.
Critics found capturing birds in traps and killing them with particularly brutal sticks.
“Normal eviction, eviction, is useless,” said Leer’s city and landscape planner Werner Klöver.
Destruction of nests using water under pressure or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser de Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals are moving away, large colonies are dividing and dispersing in other places.”
The eviction is imaginable only in exceptional cases such as in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
“We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them.”
The problem cannot be solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of driving animals away from aversive conditioning and eye-catching offerings, in order to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens was looking for "info panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better support a pimple in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-Educational Path of Baskets in Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these highly intelligent freaks.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of noise caused by birds: "There is a great deal of communication, these birds have a lot to say about each other."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: the freaks not only use instruments of work to arrive at a feast, but they make their own tools as instruments of work.
Ethologists at the University of Cambridge recently tested four friars, how far the intelligence of birds comes.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffold with stones in order to reach a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to collapse the platform.
In a second trial, the clever crows then had to solve a more stuffy problem.
In a vertically placed cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
The birds could not reach their loot with their beak.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they caught the little bucket of the little pipe.
Three of the four men succeeded from the very beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a coup by the Bosnians and the Turks remained unsuccessful.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the qualifiers for the 2012 European Championship in Poland and knocked out Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost to Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, its fifth participation in the European Championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff return match by Montenegro 1-0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more hot in the 0-0 draw between Turkey against Croatia, Ireland took a 1-1 (1:0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty played by hand (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was faced with a yellow-red card (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick 30 meters ahead of the grid.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed off his skills at a distance and shot at a distance of 25 meters to make it 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to striker Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship of Manchester City, started a head ball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnia penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the other hand, Stark gave a controversial hand-played 11-metre penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czechs, Petr Jiracek also finished the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go for a fifth time to the EM.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) were also lucky and had to survive a shock moment in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last-minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech’s shot.
After the break, the cross had to come to the rescue of the already shot down world-class Czech goalkeeper, once again, the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed the Zagreb football miracle during that time.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the bench of the third of the 2002 EM, the Croatians were able to rejoice in their fourth round in the final of the European Championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream departure.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim was not even able to bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats left nothing to burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd minute, Bundesliga legionaries Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the field.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team from coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a 4:0 success the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at top speed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the first-goaler.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense of goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was within reach and held the ball on the line for 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe’s largest software company, SAP, plans to invest billions in China in the coming years and will nearly double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, approximately two billion dollars (1.5 billion euros) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
“We will create additional research facilities and development centers and hire employees accordingly,” announced CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP’s 176,000 global customers are located in this rapidly expanding country.
Growth plans in China are also an important element of the Dax Group’s 2015 Strategy.

Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked so well.
SAP has been active in China for more than 20 years.
“Now we want to expand our business (...),” McDermott said.
"Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
Personal Mass Slaughter
Peter Englund's new book, "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," opens with a long list of heart-wrenching characters.
A tip to get started: carefully tear this page apart and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic narrative by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the mists of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He wrote here an unusual book which he accurately describes as "a work of anti-history."
It includes some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and material.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like," with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
“Beauty and Sorrow” summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, to doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some of them will become heroes.
Other prisoners of war, some will lose limbs, go crazy, or lose their lives.
Their lives waver here like the candles of a church: while some are extinguished, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He denies the idea that the First World War can only be summed up in the terrible trench warfare on the Western front.
"Beauty and sorrow" cleverly describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; a Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When cannon shots sound in the distance, and you’re a housewife, do you stay or run away?
Who will come anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, “the lack of facts has been enhanced by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors.”
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
Versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are the most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most are about deprivation and the ability to get through it.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, überall ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false wooden bone); tobacco made with dried roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
It states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages and 511 substitute coffees are also found."
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive for savagery and states about war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whiskey in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that it has no barbaric clam.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at high risk of dying, and that no one will notice it or pay attention to it.
“When you are resigned to sacrifice, you hope to have an audience,” he wrote.
It is, unfortunately, rather comparable to “a convicted man strangled in secret”.
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
“Conflict is becoming more and more a history of economic competition,” writes Peter Englund, “a war between factories.”
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the early century: the well-articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as much basic behavior as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the gonorrhea-related pus trade, which soldiers buy and spread on the genitals in hopes of ending up in the hospital," he wrote.
"The most desperate apply it to the eyes, which translates into lifelong blindness."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly suited to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way the war has "triggered exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making war on them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as Paul Fussel's Great War and Modern Memory, or Erich Maria Remarque's West Nothing New, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming I have ever read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's as if he came out of his book, grabbed that page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first misstep, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti Park would be the most empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to carry out an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could not be rehearsals of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against protesters, who went against the department’s regulations and spawned a storm of public solidarity for protesters.
The operation to clean up Zuccotti Park from its protesters was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A capital exercise was organized on Randall Island, with a view to the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers are given better training against riots – anti-terrorist measures that involve quickly moving large numbers of police officers – to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighborhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came “at the last minute,” said one regular, referring to the operation as “a mere exercise.”
“The few policemen I know who were called didn’t know they would go to Zuccotti Park,” the person said anonymously.
"The only ones who know they'd go there are at the top of the Police Department hierarchy."
The city learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people came and went to the park during the day, in the manner of migrants, so one hour in the morning was a convenient time.
"It was necessary to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages resounding from the loudspeakers appeared to intimidate the protesters.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., police said, leaving time for occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said the measure was taken solely for security reasons.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, harshly withheld by the officers.
Browne said the TV camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture footage.
As the police moved westward through the protesters’ thick business clutter, including baggage, plastic lawn and bags of sheets filled with clothes, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged, and the footage was posted on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of protesters took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some formed a barrier that the police moved to stop methodically.
A dozen people at the epicenter of the camp hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m., Kelly said.
According to police, the cleaning operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Browne, nearly 142 people have been arrested in the park.
Mostly for "disturbance to public order and rebellion".
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the highest-ranking officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operations," Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, as well as Pine Street to the south.
We saw the police widening the perimeter far beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the roof of a police car and others were spotted puncturing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood emerged flying from the crowd.
Finally, a policeman and a protester were hospitalized.
The school aid union is suing the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a lawsuit to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools hosting disadvantaged schoolchildren.
Prosecutions are probably the union's ultimate weapon, 37th District Council, in an attempt to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, coordinators of parents and other employees, among the city's lowest-paid, lost their jobs on October 7, and union leaders compared the layoffs to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a worker-led health care fund that would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council responded, noting that dismissals of school grants were not specified in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council said they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held Wednesday to officially announce the lawsuits to the Manhattan Supreme State Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant and the complainants will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all black or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s legal department, said the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints obtained by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of dismissals in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighborhoods to support its complaint of unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants have lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the Southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five school aides out of eight female employees at Harlem’s 36th Public School, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, prosecutors say that “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can bring in funds to fill the budget gap.”
The budget of the 36 public school was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of additional funding for each enrollment of disadvantaged students.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memo used the term "overshoot" to describe the action, although "overshoot" more generally describes the action of moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six coordinators of parents were dismissed", and "not only because of exceedance".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
It would eventually appear that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement at the Capitol on the issue of the uprising in Libya.
It will have taken a successful uprising, the capture and death of the longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, backed by President John Kerry (Democrat-Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent-Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage".
“This resolution is about honoring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country,” Kerry said.
“This is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties clashed, as well as with the White House, over the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the U.S. military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution to allow the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a wide bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day as the bill failed, the House of Representatives also rejected a measure to cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
So the U.S. mission has remained in a form of legislative purgatory – Congress upset enough to criticize Obama’s management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
The indecision of Congress was overwhelmed by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Foreign Relations Committee resolution “congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom” and “congratulates the men and women of the US armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also affirms “the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) objected to the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new project.
Within the Capitol, the House is due to vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution to get a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and a few Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte, Virginia, will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to secure a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of issues.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed both in the House and in the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 House-only versions of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would “control federal spending.”
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters – especially the new Republicans who want to give their CVs a chance to boast of being the “author” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act passed last August called for the House and Senate to vote on amending a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms for which members of Congress can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wants to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment banning same-sex marriage is proposed perpetually, as is the amendment banning flag desecration.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the nullification of federal laws if two-thirds of states oppose it.
As eager as the members have been to offer amendments, they are not as quick as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 amendments at the 110th.
The rate slowed down from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added – the 27th – was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massacred but not beaten" says Gabrielle Giffords in her first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first rather than return to Congress.
While appearing on the "20/20" television newspaper on ABC, alongside Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first televised interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — calling her recovery “difficult.”
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords responded “pretty good.”
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a one-hour special edition of “20/20,” aired the day before the release of the couple’s new book, “Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope.”
The special retraced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She can use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is sitting in a wheelchair as doctors teach her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word: "What".
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with the doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends every day two hours with doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading her an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
“There have been a lot of deaths,” Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't beaten,'" Kelly said.
You've just been slaughtered.
And you're gonna get away with it, recover and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless New York City veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suit-tie stood at his feet to cheer him.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A high-ranking military attendance at the gala, which was also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, chief of staff of the U.S. military, saw the role of troops differently.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," the military high-ranking wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know. I know.
But it wasn't respect, it was just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationships that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public increasingly acts as if they are sorry for the men and women in uniform.
"We are not at all victims," said Brig. Gen. Sean B. MacFarland, who led troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
“But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock ourselves in the role of unlucky spirits.”
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unthankful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete secrecy among veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect as they faced insurgents and traveled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were holding him through the interviews were subtly asking him whether he would be able to withstand the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of the service, you are confronted with negative impressions," Colonel Cancian recalls when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from the American indifference to the wars.
The victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the military that sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
“As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as in World War II,” said retired Lt. Gen. David Barno, who led troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
Military faced with growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the military for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
1st-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It was a warning signal,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texan has put aside its concern.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
“He’s from Texas,” she said.
“I should have followed my intuition.”
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman’s room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and some not, will be anxiously awaiting the court ruling at a landmark trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether a lawsuit against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of failing to stop the widespread rape in the military, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Classified in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial initially involved 17 plaintiffs. This number amounted to 28 the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the military did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says she's going after the gallant soldiers, because the problem starts with them.
“The army is a vertical structure,” she said.
"Who are the individuals in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
The lawyer also says that since February, she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors, most of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of bringing together all the complainants in this case - thus putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will bring several lawsuits, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defense team, for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. attorney Neil MacBride, filed a motion to reject the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers on duty or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, known as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries sustained by active duty personnel.
“The alleged evil is inherent in the complainants’ military service,” the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not officially have the right to go to combat, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, especially in getting in touch with local women.
Out of these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost their lives – two-thirds in combat.
It's time for the military to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are underway in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Center is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation is preparing a lawsuit against the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a group for human rights.
His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veterans Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in how to process claims for benefits for people claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine separate bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Department of Defense’s Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, since according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of cases registered in the army were the subject of a trial - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Susan Burke's case describe their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informed the military police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell in detail 11 times about her rape to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and the blood of her abuser - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge, at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her assault.
Six people testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was handed down,” says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in the psychiatric unit, and when I came out, I remember telling my commander, 'It wasn't his trial, it was mine.'"
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed on less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefits.
Whether the Lyman case and the other complainants will move forward or not, is a long story, says John Turley, a law professor at the University of Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents posed by responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he added.
These things only change when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn in their favor, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the military on this issue as long as there is no reform," she said.
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
Walls Have Eyes: Researchers Study You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to being caught in a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was faced with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, chatting with a few of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networking sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
“We realized it wasn’t that hard to find them,” said Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by DEMOS’ think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site’s advertising tool to find the people they’re looking for with scientific precision — the way marketers have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team found that half a million members are fans of far-right groups in Europe. They targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to respond to a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes towards violence, and their optimism about their own future.
By connecting with these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries – without leaving the office.
“It’s a new way of doing research,” says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not at all surprising: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and anti-immigration.
But surprisingly, “those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen.”
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new must-have tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study all topics that touch on health issues such as social trends, through “Likes,” wall posts, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the “data supernova” generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research papers whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you might not be able to approach on the street.
“Before, when you were trying to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them.”
“You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to come in,” Bartlett said.
"Facebook avoids all of this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social issues.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook about their drunken exploits were vastly more likely to be alcoholics than discreet students about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that the students’ colleagues, such as counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
“You can’t treat a problem if you don’t diagnose it,” Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Center for Children’s Health, Behavior and Development at the Children’s Research Institute in Seattle, says the Washington Post.
“We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized.”
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout rate in the 2010 midterm elections, and a national happiness index (thanks to the only available information - digital freedom champions have long argued that the site could make its treasure trove of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not – in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of a survey they haven’t even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than through the Internet, there is anything else online.
"I don't think a lot of users have ever thought about the fact that a researcher can study their profile," said Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, according to a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As far as they know, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user’s wall.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things,” Selwyn said.
That's why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools one can use.
“Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people,” he says.
“Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect – and the social is not in front of a computer.”
"Cold and Inhuman": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to organizing the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
“I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norwegian Templars,” he told a courtroom filled with 500 people.
“As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I reject it because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts, but I don’t plead guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during the monologue because he "didn't want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a speech on paper, talk to the parents of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked police to keep Breivik in custody for an additional 12 weeks, banned him from speaking to the media for four weeks, and warned him that authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others to be sure he would be put behind bars.
All participated in the hearing in order to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian television station NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made a little progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial, looking journalists and survivors in the eyes as he walked in and out of court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not insane. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The July 22 attacks, therefore, appear to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But that does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the entire nation.
“I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that’s not the case,” a relative of one of the victims said.
“It would have been much easier.”
7 Lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview at the Movies This Week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most telling in a recently found Steve Jobs interview that will air this week in the first part of a film about major markets, is how this creative mind had understood the processes and workflows of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as a flowchart enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders were suffering from a "illness making them think that a great idea does 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates an idea."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds", which traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for over an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years since Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aimed at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in transport.
It is only after the death of Steve Jobs that a full video is found in the director's garage.
This video is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be released on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic here to expose technological philosophies and his business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide an accurate answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs’ perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems eager to hear Cringely’s questions, giving him a kick to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision on the future of computing.
It’s one thing to read posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and man-inspiring that we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then puts them into practice.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
“All these years I’ve always asked, ‘Why are you doing things?’ and the answers are constantly the same, ‘Oh, just because you have to do them.’”
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed with how costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" assessed at a glance and then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated factory that guaranteed the accurate calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick to the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that used to hack phone networks and make free long-distance calls.
The device has been the subject of many writings beforehand, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball with different things half a dozen times and you were screaming on the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," Jobs laughed.
“We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
We didn't both know much, but we invented a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without that.
Steve Jobs continues by recounting a wonderful trick he and Wozniak have set up: he phoned the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go insanely laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love for technology (and Bill Hewlett’s outreach):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and gives him a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my definition of a company and the way employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of the HP employees to visit the company’s research labs, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the “first desktop ever designed.”
It was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube, and I fell in love with it.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for this machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products at a glance.
At the beginning of his career, while he settled to sell a few printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working on only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly as well as the delivery of the finished devices.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big arguments... they were yelling at me and saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are suffocating:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industry leaders would go wrong and lose control of their market share.
“Let’s say you worked at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or a better printer, and then what?”
You have the monopoly of the market, so the company does not find more success.
Sales and marketing can make it evolve, so [it’s these types of people] that end up leading businesses and product-specialized staff are pushed away from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
This is what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned the entire IT industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat to victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop that idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
There are compromises to be made... Some things you can’t do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You have to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It is about trying to expose yourself to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product that you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal great ideas.
The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health law opponents as court meets
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the issue of political discord, whether opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case in the high court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for review.
One of the cases involved a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying point for conservative activists nationwide.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March next, and the result will probably be of a nature to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law, is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as a solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clement’s law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a longtime group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, a top Republican in the Senate and a professed opponent of the health law.
The guests featured at dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges have been present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there is nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would arguably argue with the Canon 4C code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraisers from law-related and other organizations although the judge cannot be an intervener, guest of honor, or appear on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas near two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm government ethics activists.
“This violation of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court abides by the same rules applicable to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, chairman of Common Cause.
“Judges were drinking and dining and at a gala fundraiser with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dismisses any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high-profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general solicitor for the Obama administration when the first opposition to the law was brought to trial.
Her critics pressured Kagan to refuse to hear the case, saying she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airliners
The airline Emirates orders 50 Boeing 777, two-aisle airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a market estimated at more than $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order for 50 of its products.
However, it is quite a case when the company in question is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record amount of 18 billion dollars.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago-based airline estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion in the next 20 years.
Over the weekend, Boeing reported on the most expensive order for commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
The Emirates airline based in Dubai placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Airshow that the airline is also likely to buy 20 more aircraft, bringing the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing said on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The amount of these six aircraft is more than one billion dollars.
“This is clearly very positive for Boeing,” said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
So not only do they have the means to pay for these planes, but an increase in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so detrimental to them since the country would make money from the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point as these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil rises, Dihora said.
“They have natural risk coverage,” he said.
Emirates' order strengthens Boeing's dominance of the large-scale aircraft market and helps curb the attempted encroachment of competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is rescheduling its debut to increase the momentum following the demand from its customers to increase its load capacity and range.
Boeing's shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Obviously Beaten in Michoacán Elections
Luisa Maria Calderon says that the drug traffickers helped her opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the post of governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister appears to have lost her attempt to gain access to Michoacán's governorship in violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
Early results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was leading the race for the post of governor of that western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the entire country," Luisa Maria Calderon told the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... They seized ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only by a few Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother’s Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the first results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection to drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in the trafficking of marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates renounced the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the elections in Michoacán look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging with a view to next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has called on India and China to prepare to help the eurozone get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would impede the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the managing director of the Manila-based BASD, said the two fastest-growing economic powers in the world must “do everything in their power” to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe’s difficulties with an “indifferent eye” and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe’s leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We are all together in this crisis.”
“Therefore anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful,” he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
“So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them.”
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The blossoming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has sparked fears that the global economy will fall into recession, and has sparked calls from major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Nag predicted that the IMF would channel any Asian aid, but he also said that bilateral assistance – such as buying bonds from the US bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater bargaining power to Europe’s Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from a drop in exports and a drying up of foreign capital inflows.
“Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and agitated,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth.”
“It’s not a choice, it’s an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?”
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help the rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get the 1.2 billion Indians to accept aid to Europe, of which at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
“One day they will discover that the Greeks are retiring at age 50 and that they are going on a vacation in the sun and they will find it difficult to swallow,” he said.
Lee Howell, the president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep many Greek officials well-paid in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Nag said the eurozone crisis was likely to cause “significant repercussions” across Asia.
BASD’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces “risk of loss” due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to develop “relief plans” to protect themselves from an economic turnaround and significant capital leaks.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defense Reductions
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta raised pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from Pentagon corridors to Afghanistan’s battlefields, through the gatherings of civilians.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
“The impacts of these cuts would be devastating for the ministry,” Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach a budget agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions as well as the freezing of many new projects.
“Such a significant reduction, applied indiscriminately, would render most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable – you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel – and seriously undermine other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to senators.
“We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian staff and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal.”
“These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparedness.”
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, Panetta continues.
"While wartime financing of foreign contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by severe disruptions in basic budgets," Panetta said.
“Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war.”
Staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted.
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details about the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Department of Defense.
“The consequence of a kidnapping of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power.”
“We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action,” the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when Panetta’s letter was published.
“It’s not a consequence we can live with, and it’s certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it shouldn’t have to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and senators’ recent warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself reached the top Pentagon post cumulative of years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a military man with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
“It’s a fighter jet, without enough trained pilots.”
“It’s a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don’t have enough trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission,” Panetta said in his preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
“It’s a depressed force, poorly prepared and unable to cope with potential adversaries.”
"De facto, it invites aggression."
In an addendum to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could “generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limits on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and assumed unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the crosshairs, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat ship and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and internet celebrity Anthony Weiner has become an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign funding related to covering an extramarital affair.
And then, none of those who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton set off by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given students the test responses in order to be clearly visible on their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach otherwise send the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceptions do we encounter?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or spotting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout out: "I got you," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades from prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don’t stammer, blush, or aren’t always agitated.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can uncover the truth by examining the statement structure, facial micro-expressions, question formation, and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include including hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others well, putting them at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more lies "centered on themselves" while women tell more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How can you tell if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establishing benchmark data".
This helps to provide a point of reference for measuring subsequent changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally shakes their feet constantly so as not to throw unfair accusations when you see them shaking their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues to misleading verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Misleading people can immobilize the upper body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean toward an exit, change posture significantly, or present a "post-interview" relief - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to seek to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skidded using the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Misleading individuals may also use distant language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember right... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone’s chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
Controversial Pipeline Plan Will Be Confused After U.S. Threat of Late Approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico — sparking anger from unions while appeasing environmentalists — the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada said Monday evening that it will move the projected pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still gain its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada official Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that it will eventually get approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the State Department's announcement last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid areas of the Nebraska dunes and Ogallala Aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"It's a real path forward," Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican, told Fox News.
The re-environmental review commissioned by the State Department would likely have postponed any decision until 2013 after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department’s decision, and expressed support for it.
The 2,735-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs related to the pipeline.
But lawmakers in Nebraska opposing the plan are pushing for a law to force the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation, away.
The Department of State’s ongoing environmental impact study found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry said the department’s inspector general ordered a separate investigation of the review process, centered on two issues.
One is that a TransCanada lobbyist, Paul Elliott, who was a Hillary Clinton campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that Disco diva Patti LaBelle, launched into a violent outburst in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited out of fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" frightened the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 last year as stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk walked down the lobby of their Riverside Boulevard building with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and posed her daughter for a while.
“Someone came behind me and said, ‘Do you know what your daughter is doing?’ I said ‘yes’ and went to get her,” she says.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
“She told me in an aggressive tone, ‘You shouldn’t leave your daughter by the door,’” says Roseanna Monk.
“I said, ‘What you say or think doesn’t interest me.’
She became enraged and began to use swearing - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started sprinkling water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,' said the child's mother.
LaBelle jumped at the mom — who was still holding Geneviève in her arms — and must have been held back by her entourage who drove her to a car waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she started vomiting, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note apologizing to LaBelle, but got no response.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money received to a cancer charity for the children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle accountable for her conduct," Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially towards a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child.”
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has declined and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the economic adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange for the deterioration of the main indicators.
Low temperatures in February, aside from causing trillion-dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's opportunities for growth, caused overall economic activity to contract by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, mainly justified by the historic decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost allocations issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there was damage of 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, 78.03 percent of which suffered total damage and the rest of 21.07 percent suffered partial damage, the main crops were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the state during the first three quarters of the year is a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand, a thousand.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
“What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because for people who make dollars illicitly it is not easy for them to work to earn them, to invest them and use them in something,” he said.
Detained migration
López Cervantes pointed out that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been restricted, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which causes unemployment to rise," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the labor market is worsened by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the population employed in this state work there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for the gap for the state is the low wages, the entity has the lowest wages in the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Forecast.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, much lower than the national average, which stands at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
IED contraction
Apart from declining economic activity and rising unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction in Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the FDI of the State reached $630 thousand 697, representing a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the State Government has a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt (disambiguation)
Given the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a loan of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactivating the economy, the approval of the State congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no profit was observed.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of the Sinaloa economy during this year has really been very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground that we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our effort, we have to align the effort of all and especially the good already synchronized performance of this new government team, hopefully next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events such as the frosts at the beginning of the year have held back the state’s economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is the product of several events, among which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Patronal Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that we want to channel the state to productive activities of more dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that we unleash the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
A lot to do
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channels the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in how public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that a lot of work has been done and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he said.
Convicted of 8 kilos of marijuana
A person residing in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana intended for sale.
In accordance with file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by agents of the Mexican Army on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, outside number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The little trafficker was riding in a white pick-up truck in which he carried a black bag in the vehicle's luggage rack and on the co-pilot's square a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated items were made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Center for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Offences.
Debts towards contributions to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 para migrants may not be finished or register serious delays due to a lack of economic resources, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel López Miranda reported.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are at risk because the State Government has failed to fulfil its obligations to provide contributions of more than 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide the 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their completion.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end they gave us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he said, "and we, in order not to register delays, we started the works and we have advanced a lot, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already suffered this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year we, in order to have access to these programs, had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he said that they had requested the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the managements so that the corresponding percentages arrive as soon as possible.
“They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is coming to an end, they have given us nothing.”
The Court validates the "analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analogue signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not met.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not having reached the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, prepared by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is an attribution reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and by admitting the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the ministers resolved to also dismiss the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the Minister-President said that he disagreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"Neither do I consider that if it did it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has for constitutional mandate the direction of the state.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Postponing the change, he argued, would be postponing the benefits of digitization that involves a public interest decision that does not only have a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of economic direction of the State, encompasses a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have very specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded the sphere of competence of the Congress in a form, because it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislative, he assured.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place in the Governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the election process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 trials.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time that the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral trial to take effect and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the deadlines provided for by the Law of the Journal.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described as “invalid and illegal” the vote of the state’s proxy for constitutional reforms, because he does not have the right to “sanction or challenge” them.
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote", Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to realize the partial and total counts of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there is no ballot and counting in the file of the ballot box is not located at the president of the latter; or there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received at all the polls of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate supposed to win the respective election and the one who obtained the second place in the poll is equal to or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition of the representative of the party and/or who has the coalition.
The total counting of the ballot may also be carried out if at the end of the joint counting it follows that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win and the candidate for the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party from which the candidate was second, in which case the electoral packages that were the subject of the party counting will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the driver Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around night, and Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a requiem.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé.
After receiving tributes to other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board an aircraft of the Mexican Air Force, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the vigil chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where family and friends went.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former technology bachelor’s colleagues and the American football team that Felipe Bacio was part of when he was preparing for the bachelor’s degree.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always said that <0x60><0x60>to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was an extraordinary father and son, an affectionate brother and cared a lot for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, because they said that he even had truck pain; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he traveled to Zapopán for his parent's graduation, for this he knows that his uncle is dying doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, homage that had at the head of the governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army studied it, through the Sixth Military Institute, the Mexican Air Force has in the Saltillo and technic students, director.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people, all officials of this service.

Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before they were found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by gunfire in different parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km drive from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
A few people who passed through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has the color beige and coffee the portal was wide open.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was wearing a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him was another one with a white T-shirt, with straps.
A meter away was the body of another individual with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the stomach.
According to the data obtained in situ, the three people were murdered in another place because no sockets were found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by an organized delinquency group towards the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are considered to be related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to published information, in a first incident on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was successfully rescued.
They were confiscated from three buildings and one cell phone and claimed to be part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on November 12 at 6:00 a.m., military personnel made a surveillance route in Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
In arresting them and conducting an inspection, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Subsequently and after these statements, on 13 November at 2 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put the country on the verge of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with Italy's president on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm that he can form the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his conversations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner for Journalists said.
Monti did not say explicitly that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The “framework is now well-drawn,” he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to levels impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets has placed the yield of Italian construction bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti’s chances of success were boosted considerably by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what are likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by noting that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers’ groups and youth and women’s organizations.
He will finish his tour of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was named Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi was going to resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.9 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the Eurozone.
Monti said his Government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms before moving forward with the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be trained only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that reciprocal mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of the Spaniards is superior to that of the Costa Ricans
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 summoned participated in 50 matches.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 summoned by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 pm, at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly standings, count an ample register of inter-selected games of class A, the Tricolore only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
That figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the All-Star League and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain intense activities in the year in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this must be added the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup.
Costa Rican footballers, on the other hand, have international experience limited to one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish national team is that of goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equaled the record of former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international games.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolore and they will set a new record for Spain, 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the brain driver of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other hundred-year-olds of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and Schalke's forward Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l González with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and close to Michael Umana are left-back J<0xC3><0xBA>nior D<0xC3><0xAD>az, with 48 attendances and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
Less.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side, with fewer than 30 attendances, Roy Miller appeared with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bol<0xC3><0xAD>var has only one and Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson are not yet starting.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures them that it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
Bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The band is in the South American wing of its two-decade-long celebration tour of work and on Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, the fact that Pearl Jam will be performing in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has come true for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I spent in Costa Rica only once on vacation; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
We are excited to bring our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity in the days before.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time has passed until this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does it add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve offered over the past 21 years have taken place over the past two weeks.
We have offered two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has shaped us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to producing there.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfers and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always going to surf in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; this is how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What have you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform over 120 songs and everyone loves different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t performed in a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve achieved?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don’t think any of us ever imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we’ve been doing it for over 20 years makes it sound like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together thrills us a lot.
We love and love creating music.
We are fortunate to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean to you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of grunge?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group of large groups.
We are very friendly with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is uncommon.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much stranger when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honor for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with them all and it's an honor for us to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a group like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that’s a lot longer than many bands normally last.
Firstly, I believe that we are all fortunate to be still alive, and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great crowds and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we have to respect the music and what brought it, without thinking about the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which doesn't really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We’ve been a band for almost three years and we didn’t release a record until Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There’s been a lot of frustration for the fact that it’s lasted so little and the most important thing is the fact that we’re still very close friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh with a lot of other things, it was always a pleasure to talk to him and laugh,
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we can’t wait to see what Las Robertas can offer live and it has to be very distracting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yello Ledbetter live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first to remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, that I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the bands that came up at the same time and, if that’s relevant now, I think it’s wonderful, because it’s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney now make the best music ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe, that are called very obscure songs, even though these may sound a bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there’s trauma in your life and you lose a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs probably represent that to me.
I also think that you can also be happy and even like that you can make obscure music.

Former president Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he presents in the pies, his family doctor informed.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including tongue cancer, for which he has been operated four times and is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to get the benefit of remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, arguably he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated four times on tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilograms, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst of the pancreas, kidney stones, hypertension and circulation problems in the feet, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been serving prison in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and formed by various ministers and bosses, will on Tuesday initiate a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point in a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proper for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to information published by the South American country's presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica seeks to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that occurred when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations of its ambassador of that European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group of the world’s strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of tax exchange agreements to get out of the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In trade terms, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the evil Bowser, but he had never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to everyone’s stores this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," Nintendo's Spanish press chief Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez said during the video game's presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally designed for this support", because hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of the existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows for fast and smooth play.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most expert will be able to do a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to cheer in three dimensions to be able to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a nod to the fans of the saga and repeats the success formula of previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachied plumber has to roam peril-mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Even though I player find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves extradition of Portillo to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had given orders for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus, the trial ends for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country, which demanded Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure "he had not helped" in any judicial resolution and that he had given rise to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will also be extradited for murder and serious injury, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done implies an executive step after exhausting all judicial and constitutional proceedings to try the former proxy for the 2004-2004 interval.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of funds of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the trial that preceded the extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of untrained youth
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter of a century.
In addition, there is a long history of jobs that this social group currently has.
The anniversary served yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former industrial complex of Fabra i Coats that more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella neighborhood in 1986 with the aim of helping low-educated, unemployed, drug addicted or marginalized people.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu has concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years have collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, in the middle of the electoral season, showed the unitary character of the work carried out by Trinijove.
Next to the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor of the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist Municipal Councillor Ricard Goma.
The current Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended in the Great Hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president set Trinijove as an example to know how to fight bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-party, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments in the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the property at noon yesterday without any resistance.
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of 51 Rue Balmes lived has ended.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the building they occupied illegally at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-parties that despaired the neighbors, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from recurring.
"From that day onwards there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and some of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residue of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic drinks.
The first three apartments were the scene of the mass festivals, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied, her business fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property were making her disloyal competence, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the recreational space had to respond to complaints from neighbors about the noise, while, according to her, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbors in the area.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the problems were so great that she even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since he "forgive him" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbors about this situation.
The chairman of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández D<0xC3><0xAD>az, had requested last week the "immediate evacuation of the building to end the problems of common life and civility that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in recent months squatters had occupied all floors of the building and almost all apartments and that in some apartments there were robberies as well.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behavior generated in the property".
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the Catalan local police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to 35 Mont-ral Street after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not orientate on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi Bear.
That was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition consisting of 16 contests for all access doors to Collserola.
A door brings back the idea of a park, without a doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both in terms of its organization and in terms of reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this ancient caste of elect talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is precisely one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the contest is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks has not been carried out.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "doors of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": we must not think of these "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it is necessary to act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban planning world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils".
Perils that derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of the public space" after the experience lived in the '80s and that had in the area of the Forum "his song of the swan".
The first fear is the proper delimitation of the boundaries on which one can build.
“Limiting something means already setting the next step,” that is, exceeding it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [in reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause real disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol thinks that, by simplifying, the slope of the region El Valles de Collserola "can be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronate of Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers to its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he hears that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduit that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success," he says) that had to be created: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gives the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the contest there is a lack of an overall vision of Collserola: "16 cross-sectional contests have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is no longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole".
This means, at least in this case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can clash in the program and definition with that of the architect of the neighboring door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately above that of Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and he will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red’s legal power-holder granted pardon to the mayor’s brother of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail.
After spending 72 years in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazábal will be released after the Casino Red’s legal power-holder pardons him before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a blackmail trial against the mayor’s brother of Monterrey.
After the Casino Royale attack, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas allegedly demanded that he pay an economic quota for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the gambling house to operate clandestinely.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor PANiste and on September 2 he was arrested and held in temporary detention for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Heritage Offences, he was transferred to the Detention Center 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He stayed there for the next 49 days when a second detention order was issued after the Public Prosecutor's Office had dismissed corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal centre allegedly for blackmailing the Red Casino owners with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the middle-security detention center because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonas' guilt, such as that relating to the receipt of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
On Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez, appeared before the judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore, he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor's agent attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Gómez if the damage had been recovered and who of the partners of the gambling house had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197/2011, Jonas Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and no claim can be made in connection with the trial against him; no compensation for damages or punishment will be requested from him.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The clerk of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonas that he had been legally pardoned and his file would be closed.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate release issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air crash in which lost his life the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of the accident in which Secretary of Government Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter crashed directly into the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that the investigations done in the impact zone do not report the appearance of ground parts.
“In a research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact occurred structurally.
“The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The ground had a slope of seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
For the moment, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can take a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, general manager of Aéroports et Services Auxiliaires, assured that the moment of impact, the Presidential General Staff helicopter was operating at cruise speed and this happened on a soft ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruiser operation at the time of impact," he said.
During the press conference, the holder of the TBS, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
Reports in the AICM mentioned adequate conditions for take-off, and as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-rise cloud layers.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to cloudy conditions the crew sought a lower-height area and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of the remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far makes it possible to assume that the impact occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The model of dispersal of the aircraft remains suggests that the helicopter collided with the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No traces of fire or explosion have been detected:
In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of any type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9 thousand 200 feet above average sea level, the ground had a slope that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he possibly disarticulated himself along his journey.
The information provides evidence that appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After careful searching in an area wider than the encircled location, around the accident, no dispersed parts of the aircraft were found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find the Obesity Gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in the case of children and young people, called 'Children's and Adolescent Obesity Genetics' protocol that will have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Specialty Hospital of the National Medical Center of the 20th Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre d'Investigation et d'<0xC3><0x89>tudes Avancées (Cinvestav) of the Institut Polytechnique National (IPN).
The investigation invites the right and non-right population to participate in the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where evidence to minors is carried out every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sport Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the target of gathering 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Independencia Sport Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Morelos Sport Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the purpose of this investigation and the e to know the components and importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the implementation of the specific questionnaires related to food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family inheritance of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics will be applied to all participants (people associated with childhood obesity are being identified).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of health professionals' concern for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 reported that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of girls, of 47 per cent; in the case of overweight there was also a dramatic increase," stressed the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population is different from others in its genetic history.
He reported that on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American, a 30 percent European and a five percent African heredity and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which makes it possible to detect if they are overweight or obese.
Ila even said that the presence of dark-colored folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the likelihood of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and lifestyle changes that they must make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentary lifestyle, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying in front of the TV most of the day and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pie with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM's asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200,000 blackcurrants each rainy season in the Valle de México Metropolitan Zone, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the tarpaulin is adequate, the blackcurrants could be reduced or even reduced.
During his conference A Technological Opinion on Blackcurrants, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he is responsible for is developing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malthenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, of almost 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day according to environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The CF researcher observed that the streets of Ciudad de México were mostly covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass there generating forces, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If there was modified asphalt, it would spread better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt layer, he says, is placed a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt layer and provide grip on the street.
Being the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material from which it is made must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, as these significantly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all the layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first that gets spoiled is the rolling film and only subsequently is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that must be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the vehicle load and ensure its satisfaction, to avoid frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna not to get the crown from Miss Colombia.
Valle receives her 14th Princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was mounted with the crown and the sceptre, the department already totals 14 titles of Princesse and Melina (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1983), Aljuela (1981), Aljuela (1981), Aljuela (1981), Aljuela (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Alju) Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Alju) Alju (1981), Alju (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Aljula (1981), Alju
Today the big question that many people ask themselves is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, as she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Beautiful Face of Vogue, titles obtained by Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the decision made by the juror to designate her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why?" posed by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is the Valle candidate’s answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it's a way of culturalizing, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it's a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Burning Blood".
This answer did not please, firstly, because of the term "culturalize" and secondly because it did not explain concretely how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, it happens what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book.
Among the assumptions made is that Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist from Bogota hinted that being the favorite, the cheerleader and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Although at both parades she appeared confident of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for the RCN Channel’s “Como en casa” program, said that the fact that Melina was named princess “confirms the fact that the candidate who wins most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen.”
In addition, Valle avoided the press in the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That is why two days before the election international jury Lucy Doughty said that they were looking for a woman committed to the social necessities of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on her social sensitivity, that before starting the Contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his flaws in his buttocks and fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with healthier body, good diet and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile the journalist Guido Hoyos, of the magazine Cromos considers that the error of the candidate of Valle were the surgical interventions she had undergone.
“The surgeries are good, but Valle wasn’t able to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of that aspect.”
For this prize, which the National Beauty Contest gives for the first time, after the swimsuit parade a cruel prediction that happened last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo gave to Melina to not give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person from Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist has gone down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
On November 4, a CTI typist from Cali went down in history as the person who confirmed the identity of the FARC’s supreme leader, “Alfonso Cano,” by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipalities of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to reach the place where the corpses were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of frictional skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be that of the man who ran the world's oldest guerrilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like an area farmer, without glasses and much leaner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a picker and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse to those on the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the FARC.
Searching for the Imprint
For a typist from Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no margin of error, that can be crucial in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying the corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present fake ID cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher recounted that in a case of theft he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to take a fingerprint from, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in different thefts," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also remove or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently a dead man was found, with bottles of drink around him.
Intermittently, it was determined that a parent may be a suspect in the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee he's the killer, it puts him on the scene.
A CTI typist explained that “fingerprints are extracted from objects with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a sampler or strip is used to collect them.
Subsequently, the fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of the declining, or to the National Civil Registry.
“The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch does not necessarily become an imprint.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The “indignados” challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a court order, Manhattan’s place, where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the 'indignados' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
“Our idea is that if the court doesn’t allow us to camp in the square again, we’re going to settle in another place and we’ll continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful protests,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the “outraged” response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing protesters to stay in the camp.
In addition, the “indignados” occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which links New York and New Jersey, owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some protesters, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are hundreds of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene in favor of them before the police.
In the meantime, Zuccotti Square - which is a privately owned enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analyzed.
Some protesters displaced so far were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and they were even handing it over to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused 'certain small clashes,' said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws issued after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, but warned them that local laws do not allow them to move in with tents and sleeping bags.
The city councilman personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the protesters were 'violating the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to break the laws and in some cases, to harm other people" because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"This morning's evacuation at dawn has been disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically more interested in defending the financial interests of American workers than in defending those of American workers," the spokesman added, accusing the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
“Occupy Wall Street” officials also said they did not plan to organize “big actions” for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions to commemorate the two-month protests, which began on Sept. 17.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show
Alongside Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be on the TV show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a rescuer in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, alongside "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will be appearing on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1 playing a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the extensive Internet broadcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her then-husband, "Mötley Crüe" drummer Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary in a crib supporting a doll representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as Joseph.
Alongside Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is himself not far from the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian a "slut" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of decline at the beginning of March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, recovering even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in the country since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Government of Tokyo have estimated material losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to definitively turn the page: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, use deficiencies to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo reverted to the domestic market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refuge values" chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the forecast troubles of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger divide, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic buoyancy is determined by the health of major technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, blamed the yen for their weak results between July and September.
As markets continue to be based in the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not lower its guard.
"We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging at all.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that the majority of member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the turning points of the global economy has highlighted that major powers are being curbed.
Because it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone was even below the average, which is at level 100, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With peripheral risk premiums triggered and uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to entangle itself in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is rather imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period established in his designation may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative party New February Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new elections, he would not support the new measures of austerity in any case.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the civil disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras' message does not raise any doubts about his position: "We have pledged to assist the Transitional Government, but we have pledged nothing more."
The Conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than the EU and IMF, the bodies that must unlock the $8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the all-out Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "an unambiguous written commitment as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of $8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "predominant" position in this type of finance
Spain "has reached a preponderant position at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second largest donor in the world in terms of this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the Vth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the poverty goals set by the United Nations for 2015, and, "very especially, in the one that aims to reduce the "to half the volume of people who live with the dollar"
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for these poorest and especially for the main beneficiaries",
We have “achieved a lot of goals” and “we are facing a lot of challenges”.
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families are emerging from the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, Queen Sofia stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work of which she has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project gave him yesterday the qualification of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid from the "banking of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity “is an ethical imperative” for any democratic state.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries in times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" developed countries' governments must work under solidarity criteria and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded the "success" of giving "trust" to the "excluded" people to whom all close the door; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned on the agenda but prevailed in the autumn, notably to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax towards the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel and, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, were entitled, at the end of their interventions, left no room for doubt.
The chancellor's - and the motion's - mistress idea is based on a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, “the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe.”
This could result in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is, in any case, one of the motion proposals adopted by the congress whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and CDU leaders believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy is too.
But the milestone is laid.
Similarly, delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country on the European Central Bank’s board of directors against the weight of each economy, which obviously reinforced Germany’s weight.
Anxious to appease the climate within her party, the chancellor has multiplied references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But she has also not sought to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty quick to criticize arrogant Germany.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of “French-German friendship,” Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in the trough.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is Sick Stop Fraud?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a willingness to make savings in a context of rigor, but is no less announcing an axis of the presidential campaign on the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stops.
Firstly, with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private employees before taking care of a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days of wages, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but that would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, of more symbolic scope: to impose on civil servants one day's leave of absence without compensation in the event of a stoppage of work (they have so far no leave of absence, against three days in private).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses related to work stoppages.
"The controls are going to be much more important and, in addition, if you are caught, you will reimburse," Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the advertising effects seem somewhat disproportionate to the reality of work stoppage fraud.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, which have most often paid off.
The French are not sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us first look at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily allowances were awarded in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with 11.3 billion euros.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and occupational accidents, and 54% concerned sick leave, or 6.2 billion euros.
This is 2.5% of health care expenditure.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of illness stoppages were of a duration of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone to stopping work than elsewhere.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) fluctuated between 10% and 11% in France, compared with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick leave fraud represents very little in the face of black work.
As for fraud, it only reaches a small scale.
The tightening of legislation since 2002 means that checks on sick leave for more than 45 days are systematic.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 made for short-term stoppages were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of arrests of more than 45 days, systematically monitored, there were 11% of cases "inappropriate or unjustified" out of 1.2 million, or 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had sick leave.
A figure that represents very little compared, for example, to that of black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, this would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to bring its economy back on track.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos told parliament on Monday, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
“In order to continue efforts to rebuild the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme,” said the head of government, who delivered his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the eurozone "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papadémos predicted that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “by around 9%” of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday offered his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but opposed to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras said that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians Live in Denial of Death, Royal Society of Canada Report
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the findings of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine, participated.
This committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow for assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, with a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries on the planet.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has spawned a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medically or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in hospital.
Overall, the country's highest rate is in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report draws conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change the Criminal Code on euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that such decriminalization leads to abuses in enforcement, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on non-competent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signer of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference that more cases of these outbursts would be found precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal.”
“Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow end-of-life people to alleviate their suffering, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of older or disabled people are of less value.
As for people who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents estimate that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing care for a patient, the situation is less clear, say the report's authors.
Also, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The expert committee also calls for health professionals to be trained in their duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
When it comes to palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts signatories of the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who would be tired of life and who would be over 18 could ask for help in suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
“In society,” he said, “there are beacons and constraints.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's findings, which she called "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly disputes the data in the report on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely in the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls on President Assad to Leave Power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Foreign Ministry’s premises yesterday.
Diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad’s Syria, which, with Russia’s support, resists them and denounces a “plot” against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus while Syria’s neighbours Turkey and Jordan took a stand in favour of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan’s King Abdullah II was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to “leave power” in Syria where some 40 civilians and members of the regime’s forces were still killed.
"If Bashar was interested in his country, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," Jordan's king told the BBC.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said that Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year have failed.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country towards which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime," after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the US, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have died in the southern Syrian region of Deraa, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians were killed "in exchanges of fire and heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "on its way towards the end of the crisis".
He has also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he says is "a dangerous step".
Syria “will not bend,” he added, assuring that “the plots against Syria will fail.”
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also said he was in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis exit plan decided on November 2 and including the withdrawal of armed forces from cities plagued by protest and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said yesterday the decision of the Arab League was "incorrect" while China urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan, while avoiding supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time from markets and sacrifices from Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded some time from the markets to train his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifice", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in talks with political parties yesterday before meeting with trade unions and employers today.
He is expected to set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important program with a lot of sacrifices," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, said after meeting with the president-designate.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he expects Mario Monti to ask Parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for preparing a government and its agenda, he said, saying "certainly the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment by the president had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern regained the upper hand, notably after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The prime minister-designate is expected to form a team of mostly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government will last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to House Speaker Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti pledged, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim that Italy "become a protagonist again" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its fiscal balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further stringent measures.
Italian "patron of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that does not have growth can not meet the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the editorialists.
The big unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy must place €200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
A Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) draws on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that UN agency to identify this researcher.
The IAEA last week expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS drawing heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, reportedly worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the center to establish a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated in the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system was aided by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but, as one member state informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear program of his home country."
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence declined slightly or little, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14% increase in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628 cases, 47.3% of which were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes increase again," Human rights organization Human rights First stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior official at the organization.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could involve improving police reports on “hate crimes.”
The “hate crime” in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the civil rights struggle.
This legislation had been passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin color, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter is changing its platform and looks more like Facebook
The micro-blogging site Twitter introduced on Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to allow its users to observe the activity of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to more easily follow the activity of other "Twittos", the Internet users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and those who follow you.
This lets you know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
The new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctual functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the Facebook and Google+ mainstream networks.
On the network, users were debating "tweets" decided on the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive, and it’s too much like Facebook,” writes <0x40>jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed,” <0x40>dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria (disambiguation)
Insertion of a "Golden Rule" in the Constitution
The ruling Social-Democratic/Christian-Democratic government in Austria on Tuesday decided to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible degradation by the rating agencies of the sovereign rating of Austria (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a council of ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the maximum 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency were lowered by a single notch, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year,” said Deputy Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus following a request from the eurozone member countries at the Brussels summit on 26 October: the heads of state and government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of the public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The scheme adopted by the Austrian government is closer to the "German model", as Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural public deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, as of 2017, the federal government’s structural public deficit will not exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states as well as municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The objective is to raise public debt by 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
Yen fort
Noda threatens further intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose not far from the historic levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massive yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record since 1945 against the greenback.
But the yen has since risen steadily, boosted by purchases from investors who see it as a “value haven” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar slipped below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro was over 160 yen.
This spike in the Japanese currency is damaging the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues from Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the north-eastern region of Tohoku, said Noda, who fears that the rising yen will kill the fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy rebounded with growth in the third quarter – 1.5% compared to the previous quarter – for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households plagued by the disaster.
But the prime minister ruled that the price of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures,” hinting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to 55 billion yen (519 billion euros) the ceiling on the amounts it spends on purchases of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Rates are rising, the stock markets are falling.
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
Still worried about the stability of the eurozone, the European stock markets are sinking a little further into negative territory, on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gave up 0.4% and London 0.1%.
“With the new tensions on the yields of euro zone states in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains.”
"Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market players about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has eyes on Europe and trade will continue in a narrow corridor of variation as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The resurgence of concerns about the future of the eurozone penalizes the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10am, the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in congress on Monday, adopted a motion including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
Borrowing rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish bonds of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions over interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of stakeholders.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain finds itself in the spotlight of the markets, as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds from Germany and Spain has reached a new record high.
Pending growth figures for the euro area
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised downwards the figure for the second quarter, with gross domestic product (GDP) falling by 0.1% instead of stagnation.
And, it is truly the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., as the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a subject that cannot be addressed on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affects the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy that an election meeting is an opportunity to reflect on such issues and on nuclear issues.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic evolution will result in a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless we deprive a huge portion of the world’s population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will need to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity permanently, not to mention the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to give up nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just wants to build only the latest generation of power plants.
Conversely, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States, on the other hand, decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its park by resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, focused on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in higher electricity prices, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, especially from Russia, a leap in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all of these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
European champion of wind power, from which it derives 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; by virtue of which, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Conversely, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power illusory.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not manifest a principled opposition to this energy, polls show.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has helped to build an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it trains a galaxy of specialized SMEs in international markets and makes them very creating non-relocatable jobs.
If France were to decide to leave nuclear, it would be to sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing as a skin of grief the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate for sixty years when its manufacturer’s decline would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity production, nor does there exist a diabolical one.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
In France, we have an Autorité de sécurité that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville construction site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human errors caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did for the previous two.
As a result of this approach and a cooperation between the French and German security authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all the electricians eager to build a power plant, the stopping of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the free path to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy package for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of the figure, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that made the news, the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of May 23) proclaiming in the passage that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus on this between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million migrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on both the left and right.
For both sides, immigrants are perceived as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay off electorally; but it is economically very costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and unemployment in countries that receive employment.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and hampering employment.
Fears about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are likely to replace national workers, especially low-skilled workers, putting downward pressure on their wages.
However, experience has shown that immigrants are in reality much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly working in sectors with a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not follow the offer of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country that has a shortage of anesthesiologists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migratory flows leads to an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real long-term wages.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among the US Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue minus expenditure) of 150,000 euros to public budgets on average over his entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to go and look for the missing growth points "with his teeth".
The teeth in question, used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, European democracy remains to be thought
Democracy is a precious good; it is also a fragile good.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would suffice for democracy to triumph over its enemies for good, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little One", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even become an instrument of oppression, as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis of the Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is equally and first and foremost a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the Greek real-fake referendum will have had the value of twofold revealing in this regard: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them, Republican soldiers are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized as necessary and in dispersed order.
A whitewash to the absolute European monarch or a leap together in the void of nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cuts, but a common, full-fledged, serene and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we can no longer stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that abides by the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, that suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is Europe as a whole that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to restore people's sovereignty to the management of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
Outcome from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long struggle against this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic government.
Oh, yeah.
But to think without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European integration.
To make the Republic in France, it had to "make" the Republicans.
The revolution in the interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
Smart cards "contactless" become more widespread
The world smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an increase of 11% in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to the firm Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is that of contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or pay for your purchases by simply approaching the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to grow further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and account for nearly 10% of the overall smart card market (6,925 million cards).
Long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payments.
Some 26 million Visa credit cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put the bites double.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
In order to move to higher speeds, banks now need to equip their customers.
"Two major French institutions have committed to systematically distribute contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," said Gérard Nébouy, General Manager of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the payment method of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices today are equipped with Near Field Communications (NFC) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They've been late."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," said Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June next in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing the market launch of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long suspected, links between the al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers has now “acquired certainty”.
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he said.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerien investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist Axis
The analysis of calls is directed to several contacts based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has stayed long in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram and the other to a man who says he is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these “supports” had been increasingly evident in the evolution and discourses of Boko Haram or in its modus operandi, which now involve the use of suicide bombers or explosive devices that are increasingly complex and of the same cost as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as an uninteresting community of enlightened people.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which means in Hausa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is enjoying rapid success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for Sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, nuanceless.
The army is invading the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern strongholds.
Last Christmas, she claimed an attack that killed 80 Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police’s secure headquarters in a suicide attack, its first.
In August, the UN’s local headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would sail from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria is now a matter of concern to all security experts.
While Aqmi has invested in Mali and Niger, which al-Chebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to “share all the intelligence.”
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying thunderous statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a Republican highlight.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans – often unbacked – fuse.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and question them "for manipulating their currency", a bearish theme in an America angered by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
Worse if it should involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that “flatters” emotions.
He called for a muscular but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
“If I am elected, I will stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama is re-elected, they will have the bomb.”
He also vowed to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing is "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently ignoring the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against suspected terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a foreign policy heavyweight.
Opponents of the current president reply that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in terms of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of its naïve dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on its misrepresentations in Libya, thus sticking a label of weak.
But the attack is not so easy.
The public is rather positive about Obama’s national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she is suspicious of military interventions that lead to confinement.
And, arguing that we need to rebuild America economically to resurrect his leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The Nord Stream, new gateway for Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe directly to Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with brilliance.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic, between orchestra and fine buffet, to the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new pipeline that connects directly, under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve commanding the entry of Russian gas into the West-European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic meters of Russian gas will arrive in Western Europe each year via a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Land of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, enabling a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas to be delivered, the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge construction site feels like victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it becomes more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream to a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
This means that the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of its supplies.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has triumphed over its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the heavily gas-consuming, wealthy Western countries whose deposits are declining.
"This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that links us organically," Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon confirmed when inaugurating this pipeline, demonstrating how politically and economically the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the broad smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-clad steel to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred had to be abducted or destroyed, as a precaution," said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to multiply the measures to protect the fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy as 242 Eiffel towers, that nothing interrupts along its entire length: neither valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project leaders renounced it while the Swedes were unwilling to see a Russian state company permanently set up off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the passage of the gas in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline therefore escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by manufacturers who have planned welds to leak every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, wide one meter in diameter, and it is pushed by the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at the speed of 3 meters second, it provides accurate information about possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for fifty years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It is 200 bars on departure, and 100 on arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies created a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to this company, for twenty renewable years, all gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
The financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided by shareholders for 30% and by bank loans for 70%.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach €7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their own costs, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas exit gate.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificity of the gas that arrives before it is transferred to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created about fifteen years ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of a broken white color, as aged by time.
Yet the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of launching the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin (mole skin) which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought back to life an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
The success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces sold.
It is far from the confidential production of the first years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a portrait-robot of the buyer, because the notebook appeals to the businessman as well as the student and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, has almost 100 employees today and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city center and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also released a leopard cover, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, agenda, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a range of supports.
A success that made envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled begins today.
Despite a proactive public policy put in place in 2005, the unemployment rate of people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the entire population.
Discouraging?
“No,” stresses <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled.
" The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable. "
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, there is still a lot to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before entering employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, these are all criteria that complicate the return to employment, and which "are the root of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit workers with disabilities.
That's for the objective brakes.
The unsaid remains, the mindsets that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the interviewed managers have "a low level of knowledge of disability", with an "overrepresentation of people in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities ".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set in a law of 1987.
The latest figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the body in charge of collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Happiness"
Before taking on the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have indeed made peace.
Five months after the mood gesture of his striker against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise to say about him.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lilles.
As for the contrast between his club and selection performances, "it's a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
“I have to take my marks.”
On Friday night, Hazard came to Saint-Denis to finally "shine" against Romania in view of this match against France.
Without forgetting the notion of "pleasure".
Les Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a supporter,” he says.
Inevitably, this contributes to further strengthening the "particular" character of this meeting.
Especially since in front, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabbaye) and Adil (Rami)", he rapples.
"We met just now."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With good humor, Leekens referred to "pride".
"Pride" to play "a gala match."
"Pride" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "become a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc did a thunder work,” he said.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blues direction... Brazil in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are getting big,” he said.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll see that in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Paulo Bento's Portugal starts with a lot of optimism its return against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the other hand, both teams lacked realism.
“At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of a doubt, the Selec<0xC3><0xA7>ao, of which he has been at the helm since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to take down.
In view of the game going (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score that precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside.
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the party obviously promises to be "very tight", dictates an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very close game, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012," Carlos Queiroz's successor said.
The draw reported Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A null can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but there's a certain risk because we didn't score a goal on the outside," Bento said.
“We’re going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put as much pressure on the Bosnians as possible in order to “not give them time to think.”
It's a good idea, as long as you're realistic this time.
